This is long overdue and we need more of it!!! It‚Äôs occurred to me when listening to republicans whine and pout and call us hypocrites for the mid-decade gerrymandering act in California that there is a very firm and clear distinction between what Texas did (soon to be followed by other red states) and what California is doing. We‚Äôre not just fighting fire with fire. We‚Äôre fighting an out of control raging wildfire with a thoughtfully planned controlled burn. The response to republican corruption that we‚Äôve seen from California couldn‚Äôt be further from the hypothetical cheating republicans and MAGA media personalities want to paint it to be. The difference is that California and other blue states that hopefully will follow are putting the final decision in the hands of the voters. That is the very essence of democracy. The shady redistricting in Texas carried out solely within the confines of the congressional session should terrify EVERYONE, not just democrats and progressives. Having the politicians choose their constituents, making them far less accountable to them in the long run because they‚Äôre only beholden to the financial backers and corrupt leaders that helped them get to where they are goes against everything this country is supposed to stand for. We are patriots, not hypocrites. Just because MAGA has co-opted the term, real patriots fight for democracy and rage against tyranny, *especially* in the highest levels of government, and anywhere else it shows its face. We won‚Äôt be portrayed in history as the turncoats MAGA republicans try to make us out to be, and we can‚Äôt let them shame us for finally fighting back. | When I first noticed bezel settings becoming more popular, the wasn‚Äôt really a fan.

We tried these [Playology bones](https://a.co/d/5zAPwhR), and she‚Äôs literally still got the first one we bought around 9-10 months ago. We‚Äôve gotten her a couple more bones, a couple small and a couple medium sized. Only one of those had an issue, but it happened almost immediately after we opened the toy so I think it was just a dud. We then tried [these balls](https://a.co/d/fNG3UHo), and surprisingly she doesn‚Äôt destroy them either even though they are covered with fabric. I can‚Äôt recommend Playology highly enough.

My Process: 1) Grab a list of the Name column from Report Type List View in Setup 2) Paste in Excel, append each Name with ""\_\_c"" 3) Run the following two SOQL's: SELECT Id, Name, FolderName, ReportTypeApiName FROM Report SELECT Id, Name, FolderName, ReportTypeApiName FROM Report USING SCOPE AllPrivate 4) Paste (and combine) the outputs of those in Excel 5) Go back to your tab with the Report Type Names from Setup and do a vlookup against the ReportTypeApiName from your SOQL output. 6) Anything that comes up with #N/A do not have any Reports tied to them We have hit our 2000 limit on CRT's several times, and this identified over 500 Report Types that I can reclaim (after also doing a massive cleanup of un-used reports and dashboards).

I'm planning to retake one of the exams I previously failed, and I was wondering if anyone knows whether the questions will be the same as they were on the old platform. I‚Äôve heard there have been some updates recently, so I‚Äôm not sure what to expect. If anyone has already taken the exam today or recently, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you could share your experience. Any tips or insights would be super helpful. Thanks in advance! | I have macbook pro 2019 with i9 intel processor (I believe its the latest one with intel processor). I was thinking if its worth selling it and getting MacBook air with M3? Any thoughts? | I've contacted Salesforce through Agentforce chat and I got the feeling that its not useful at all as it was just looping and circling around couple answers... my question was trivial, im not able to login on my special org for a superbadge and im not able to reset my password as well (security question issue).

So the short answer is, its not an short path to do it. You need a lot of nerves as Salesforce support is very slow to respond. You need env hub where you can create orgs from there. Here you can read more about it: [https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/environment\_hub\_manage\_create\_org.htm](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/environment_hub_manage_create_org.htm) After that, create an org that will be purely for that app and create the namespace+package there. Only when you are ready to send it for security review, make it a released app. Also, the price is $999 for the security review, but if you are listing for for, you need to open a support case where they will give you a voucher where you will lower the price for $1 dollar. | Lightshot | good thinking, thanks | Yep, seems about right for them to focus only on M... | Got it.

Atalkez,Don't get swindled by the Wyndham Rewards offerings | MW2 Frame drop/Stuttering,"If you have done any traveling to tourist locations, you'll know what I am talking about. They're trying to convince to buy into what is essentially a timeshare. So to get you in the room so they can pitch you, they offer you certain things. For me, it was tickets to a boat ride on the Riverwalk in San Antonio, a $100 food voucher, and a certificate for a week stay at one of their resorts. Got the tickets and the food voucher no problem (after about 3.5 hours of saying no to the pitches, but I knew that going into it!). All good on that. The issue comes up now that I am looking into this certificate for one of their resorts. I was able to get verified and all of that without any real issue, but when I actually go to look at the stuff, it's pretty clearly a bait and switch. The certificate is supposed to comp me a week stay, but when I look at every single date range, and every single location that I am allowed to choose from, they have ""upgrade additional cost"" for every option. Ranging from $400 to $2200 across the board. Maybe I'm losing my mind but a ""free weeklong stay"" that was ""offered"" does not equal me paying 500-2000 to actually make use of this ""free"" stay. And no, it's not taxes, lol, those are separately listed. So, the tldr is, they offered a free week long stay but upon further inspection, it's not free at all and has more fees than I would have paid if I just booked outright. So when you go on vacation somewhere, just ignore the Wyndham offerings. They're not worth your time! How is that not bait and switch or outright fraud? Wild. | Hi all, Don't post too often, but looking for any other advice that I haven't found after hours and hours of google searches.

BeeWeens,Appt etiquette | To Stay or Not to Stay - An Acquisition Production | SFDC Admin Lead - NYC Metro (NJ) | Are you alone??,"Wanted to get some advice on a recent experience I had with a local shop. To note - I am heavily tattooed and have worked with artists all over the country, but this is a new spot for me and I cannot tell if this is poor management or if I'm being unfair in my judgement. You are only allowed to work through a coordinator via text. There is no direct communication with your artist before your appointment. It was a cover-up (which I know isn't an artist's fav) so I sent in photos of the piece and what I'd like to cover it. I offered to stop in so the artist could see it and get a sense for placement, saturation, etc. I am told that's not the process. The coordinator submits this to the artist to see if it's something they want to do. (totally fair and appreciated!) I don't hear back from the coordinator until I reach out 2 weeks later. In my case, the artist accepted it. All of the instructions indicated I would be contacted if there were any questions on placement, design, etc - which is all fine. I don't hear anything before the appointment. I take a half day off work and do my normal pre-session routine. I arrive and am met by the artist (who is also the owner) who tells me she began working on the design late last night and didn't feel confident she would be a good fit. Instead of reaching out, she decided to keep the appt but would not be tattooing me. I am then shuffled to another artist who seems less than thrilled at doing the work and doesn't have any availability until mid-May. As a courtesy, I am offered a small discount off my tattoo, which is nice but I still feel like this was poorly executed and unprofessional. | I am a 20 year tech veteran and I've been with my company for a little over a year. The pay is great and I love my team, but 6 months in it was announced that the company is being acquired by a competitor.

I have a realism piece on my leg that's maintained it's quality after 5 years. They're worth it if: 1. You can afford to go to an artist that knows what they're doing with line work. 2. Take placement into consideration. Realism on places like your hands, feet, etc are going to fade exponentially faster. 3. You take care of it from the jump - no swimming, keep it clean, no sun exposure until it's fully healed (then SPF) and keeping it moisturized. | Grown people with full, busy lives work at whatever pace feels natural to them. Your communication will likely increase as you get to know each other more, but if you're happy with the pace right now, that's all that really matters. | Gilmore Girls Parks and Rec I Think You Should Leave - very dry, weird humor but the episodes are short so it's easy to binge Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (Netflix version of Sabrina the teenage witch) Paranormal State - old seasons Dexter | If you do decide to explore online - Olivia Bottega has a ton of gorgeous short dresses.

After 2 weeks I was allowed to begin weight bearing and worked up from 50% to 100% over the past few days. I still feel like I absolutely need the crutches though. I can‚Äôt really walk and I feel incredibly weak and unstable. My outer hip bone on the operated leg also feels like it‚Äôs protruded way out in comparison to my healthy leg (maybe from swelling?). Did anyone else experience this? How long did it take most of you to get off crutches? Edit: I had a hip arthroscopy done. Labral repair and FAI repair. | Got surgery today to repair my labrum and shave down the bone spurs on my femoral head and in the socket. Having a lot of soreness and pain, especially on the outside of my hip (which seems strange). Wondering if others experienced the same thing. Anyways, I‚Äôm looking for advice to manage the pain. Of course I have Tylenol and meds, but curious if specific movements / massages / etc helped you post surgery. Especially since the soreness is making it difficult to get in and out of bed or move my leg in general. Thanks! P.s. If you‚Äôre considering surgery, don‚Äôt be scared by this post. I‚Äôm so happy that I got this done and I cannot wait to get back to running and a regular lifestyle. | Saw this post. Very interesting commentary on the grass vs turf debate. Worth checking out. | As mentioned in the title, I have this pain and aching that came out of nowhere in the back of my head/neck for 3 weeks now. My chiropractor thinks this is TMJ related but I'm not convinced. I have \*some\* light soreness in my jaw, but not enough for me to believe this is TMJ. Any thoughts? **EDIT/UPDATE**: It has been 3 months now and I'm ""relatively"" feeling better, but not 100%. I started noticing relief after seeing a chiropractor consistently for 1 month. I also started stretching my neck - which led to improvements in the pain. I'm fairly convinced that it was not TMJ but rather years of ""tech neck"" and my posture when I work. | They both seem to be CI/CD too ‚Ä¶","Framework / software library that abstracts the complexity of working with LLMs, managing prompts, wiring up tools for function calling, etc. The ‚ÄúChain‚Äù in LangChain refers to creating workflows with LLMs, where the output of one prompt is the input to another one, and so on. | I tried to use LangChain / LangGraph but the documentation was unbearable and the implemented abstractions led to more confusion. | The secret is that everyone is a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù in strategy consulting.

BullsEyeXTrader,,,"I think universities might really be a thing of the past in the future. With how fast AI is advancing, no human teacher can match an AI‚Äôs speed, accuracy, and depth of knowledge. So where‚Äôs the real value left? Honestly‚Ä¶ NONE. Yet we still have to pay huge sums for it and waste much more time in inefficient learning? Teachers are also asking AI LOL. So we have to pay them to ask AI? Seriously? 3-4 years for a degree cert where it may become redundant? We can achieve the same within 1-2 years now. Do we really believe the traditional education system can keep sustaining itself in this new era? The reality is, upskilling will be the only way to cushion the blow for people in the education industry before AI takes over completely. I believe the world will shift towards skill-based hiring: where you prove your abilities through live tests, not by showing your irrelevant degree. Most industries and roles will be disrupted by robots and AI. The real question is: how will these people transition to new roles if HRs are always looking for relevant experience. HR leaders and business owners also need to face another truth: Singapore‚Äôs median age is 43 and \~20% are age 65, getting worse. We‚Äôre not a young workforce like Vietnam or Malaysia. And here‚Äôs the kicker: more and more businesses are looking overseas for cheaper skilled labour. They don‚Äôt care about your education: they care if you have the skills to do the job. That means we have to keep upskilling, stay more valuable, and prove we can compete on a global stage with our higher salary demands due to our high cost of living here which puts us in big disadvantage competing. Most of our professionals and SMEs are still using traditional 90s systems and processes. Googlesheet &amp; Excel. Tell me your value. | 30-40s is not old. the average in singapore is 43 haha.

BusinessDuiz,,,"In my experience, most technology sucks until it gets better. The tech that improves is the tech that gets adopted or used. Technically, algorithms and machine learning only get better through iteration and scale. Using the first iPhone as an example, websites hadn't been optimized for mobile, so browsing wasn't great. SMS was limited to 140 characters and there was no app store. It was a great innovation that did a bunch of things mediocrely. All of this improved with adoption and feedback. Another example is chipsets. They are remarkably faster than they've ever been, but that's only because the semiconductors were iteratively improved over time. Nvidias first chipset was fabricated using a 40-nanometer process. Current chipsets use 5-nanometer process. The equipment used in the 5nm process was possible because of the processing power of the previously fabricated chipsets. Agentic AI is the dream that science fiction writers have had since its inception. The ability to command technology to our will and see it perform accordingly and with its own agency. I may be wrapped in my own hopefulness, but I believe that innovation requires iteration and that this technology requires an unbelievable amount of scale to achieve, It's hard for me to say that customers are being pushed a half-baked product because of capitalism. Rather, I tend towards the idea that we are at the front end of this innovation and if we want the future we must also accept the present. | The way is through, the AI can only get better if the number of people using it increases. Along side that, the more it gets used the better it can become. The companies that are going to survive the AI era are the ones that scale their AI the fastest, because they‚Äôll be the ones with good and working models. We happen to be in the phase where it‚Äôs not scaled enough to be good yet, but the only way for it to get good is to peddle it. | Enlightenment | I deleted my dating app almost 8 years now.

ChineseThrowaway6693,When do I start saving for a home/car/whatever? | Need Agentforce Help | Need Help with Agentforce Project,"Hi, I'm a dude in his early 20s living in the U.S.. I've been a diehard fire guy since I started making my own money, I am very frugal and save as much as I can. Currently have a little over 100k invested assets (no debt). My current strategy is to have a couple thousand in my checking account for bills, a couple thousand more in HYSA for emergency fund, and everything else straight into VOO or QQQM. So the amount of actual liquid cash I have at any point is pretty much always under $15,000. I'm wondering, at what point do I start saving for down payment on a house? Obviously it depends on where and what kind of house I'm trying to buy, but is there a general guideline between fire-ers as to when I might want to stop dumping everything into the stock market and start saving some cash? Is it normal for people to perhaps sell some of their index funds around their 30s for a down payment?

I was told that for one of the rounds for the interview, I will be asked to ""prepare an Agentforce demo, showing your technical skills around the agent actions: flows and apex."" I was also told that I could treat this kind of like a take-home assignment where I do it at home and then do it again in front of the interviewer. I have 0 prior experience using salesforce so I went to trailheads and followed the guide using Coral Cloud Resorts as an example. However, I feel like following that guide is not representative of what will actually be expected of me from the interview.

We have a Partner Community where Partner Users can have multiple logins (legacy implementation, don't get me started). These users want an easy way to log in to their multiple accounts in a sort of ""Account Switcher"" style. We don't have access to B2B Commerce, so there is no OOTB option available. Currently, each user needs to log out and log in with different credentials, and they find this frustrating. My thinking is creating an LWC/Screen Flow that shows the different logins that are ""linked"" together. Then using Salesforce as the identity provider service to complete the login function.

Constant_Neat_6073,Thoughts on DAN DA DAN | Recommendations for MS SWE Entry Level Programs,"Thumbnail: default | Hiya folks, I figure I‚Äôd ask the brilliant minds of Reddit for advice. Like most of ya‚Äôll I want to grow my income. Unfortunately, that requires me to make a career change. I‚Äôve decided to pursue a career in tech and consult in my current field as a secondary means of income. Accomplishing this will surely triple my income if all goes well. That said‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm hoping that you all can offer some recommendations for me in regards to entry level MS SWE (development/information security) programs. I do not have a tech background but hold a few degrees (all GPAs over 3.5). My BS-10yrs, MS-5 and 6 yrs. My fingers are crossed in hopes that learning will not be a problem‚Ä¶.. Funding it on the other hand‚Ä¶. Well‚Ä¶.I DO NOT want to take out any student loans for this additional degree. I could pay for a few classes here and there but I want to complete it as fast as I can. I‚Äôd like to make the transition within the next 3 years. So my questions to you all are: 1. Would you seek a degree or certificate? My thinking is that if I want to be able to maneuver my way up in the field the degree is more beneficial. Yes, I could go back to school but I don‚Äôt want to unless I HAVE TOO. Oh yeah, I am open to work based trainings as well. 2. What other areas do you all predict major growth in the next 5-10yrs? I‚Äôm also considering a potential concentration in AI. Someone has to manage and/or repair the AI machines if they are to take over, right? Then there is the chance that I will veer into cybersecurity. 3. Can you please share any funding/scholarship tips you used while attaining your degree(s), certifications, etc.? I‚Äôm a woman and a minority so if that helps you identify more specific funding opportunities great. Google can only help so much. Sifting through all of the sponsored ads to get to the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù is becoming a headache. Despite my mind being all over the place I do know that I am sold on making the change. It is just a matter of WHEN the transition will st ‚Ä¶","Talk to people. See if there is another office you can transition into. I‚Äôm not sure about your agency but at mine there are plenty of positions ‚Äúavailable‚Äù that are not being posted. They are just sitting. Because of this there is opportunity for people to move to other departments.‚Ä¶.something to think about. You still have time to network. | Jokingly tell him that at this point he‚Äôs become a monthly bill. | If he doesn‚Äôt want to be help accountable then I‚Äôd take his dog to the pound because he obviously isn‚Äôt responsible enough for a pet. | üòÇüòÇüòÇ@ your shirt. | I think it went one too many cycles in the dryer. | When you release your expectations you will release your worries. By this I mean‚Ä¶don‚Äôt focus on who the audience is. Focus on why they are there, the purpose of your presentation. What are the points you want to make? The emotions you want them to feel, etc. This gets easier the more you have to present. I find it helpful to hit certain check marks when I am preparing for a presentation. Some things I suggest considering: Are you confident in the presentation? Do you know the topic like the back of your hand? Have you practiced enough? Will there be a Q&amp;A section? If so, have you generated answers to potential questions/inquiries? Have you done enough dry run throughs? Were they performed in front of a small audience who could provide feedback? If you answered yes to most of these questions then it sounds like your anxiousness is rooted in how you feel they may perceive you. Let those negative thoughts go. Remember that everyone in that room were once young and less experienced too. The. Perhaps you can lesson your anxiousness so that you become more accepting and appreciative of the experience and growth it may bring your career. | This!!!!!!

Curmudgeon160,Future of Marriott? | Can we even design what is next for AI?,"Marriott and other major hotel chains have been aggressively adopting ‚Äúasset-light‚Äù business models over the past couple of decades, where they function primarily as management companies and franchisors rather than real estate owners. This strategy allows them to expand faster, generate more predictable revenue streams, and avoid the capital requirements and market risks of property ownership. An interesting question emerges about whether these companies might be strategically positioning themselves for AI-driven disruptions to real estate and travel markets. While the asset-light transition began in the early 2000s (predating widespread corporate AI awareness), the positioning does look prescient given potential AI impacts like reduced business travel due to better remote collaboration, autonomous vehicles changing location preferences, and virtual experiences substituting for some physical travel. The strategic wisdom appears to be that being a brand and technology platform is more defensible than owning fixed physical assets that might become less valuable as AI transforms how people work and travel. Whether this represents deliberate AI foresight or simply good financial instincts that happened to be future-proof is unclear, but the asset-light model certainly seems well-positioned for an AI-transformed hospitality landscape.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã I‚Äôve been staying at Marriotts for decades and it feels like the experience has slowly been degrading.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1lmcjix) | Really enjoyed seeing Eric at Red Rocks on Sunday. Trevor Hall was the headliner but I was there for 'Fruit Bats (Solo)'. Most of the crowd had no clue who he was but he got their attention and I saw plenty of Fruit Bats shirts being sold later in the night. I left just wishing to see a full show again... and came home to find out he's playing in Boulder in October. Tix ordered and new album pre-ordered. | My wife and I just moved here in February, and we're huge live music fans. A neighbor tipped us off about FoCoMX just a few weeks ago ‚Äì what an incredible welcome to the Fort Collins music scene! We were absolutely blown away this weekend. The sheer amount of great music across so many genres was amazing, the crowds were fantastic, and every volunteer we encountered was super cheerful and helpful. You all truly make the festival happen!The whole vibe was just magic ‚Äì exactly the kind of energy we love. We enjoyed it so much, I'm seriously considering volunteering next year. **Question for past/present FoCoMX volunteers:** How do you find the balance between working your shift(s) and still getting to catch the shows you're excited about? Any tips for a potential future volunteer? Huge thanks again to all the talented performers and especially the amazing volunteers for making FoCoMX such a fantastic experience! This city rocks | Sharing more than a question but maybe you have stories to add? Watched Road Diary last night and started going through all my photos from the Seattle 2/27 show and stumbled on this one where Bruce is clearly bleeding from his little finger and has blood on THE GUITAR.. :) - Add in the brace and got me thinking how much physical pain he puts himself through on these shows as well. It's the one and only time I've been up front with Bruce at a show and wow.. what a memory and the film brought it all back.

That was the night I first saw/heard Sierra. She owned RR that night.. really overshadowed Shakey imho. I've seen her 3 x since. One was the outdoor Woodland Park Zoo venue (ZooTunes) in Seattle where the entire crowd stood for the show which is a very rare event there (most people sat through the Brandi Carlisle shows there even). I think she is particularly tuned into performing at RR - her performance the last time had so much love/heart into it and now being a headliner, sold out show, it will be a night to remember. | just came here to say how enjoyable it is to see a R1T as a work truck!

Got a Nest Gen3 learning thermostat. Single zone loft in an old converted warehouse. There's an air unit with a connection to the gas hot water heater right next to it and a compressor up on the roof. All maybe \~15 years old except the Nest which is more like 3-4 years old. The Nest keeps telling me E74, ""no power is detected on the Rh wire"". It does all seem to work fine when it turns on but then the E74 comes back within a couple minutes. \- there's a little pump next to the air unit that sends water to the hot water heater drain. if I add some clean water to this, it turns on and runs for a minute - I can see the water going into the drain \- if there is a float switch cutoff, I can't find it - pretty sure I don't have one \- i put some water in the air unit drip pan and ran a shop vac to where the pump inlet is, and could see it sucking up the water from the drip pan \- it does have a Wet Switch but that seems to be happy. This is sorta buried in the duct work under the air unit - I can't see how you could ever replace this or reset it without cutting up the ducts - but I have an endoscope thing and that shows that the light is green \- when the unit turns on, I can definitely feel the cold line from the compressor getting noticeably cold. the return to the compressor seems to get really hot but I don't know how that normally feels \- wiring is really not my thing but everything inside the air unit seems ok. nothing jumped out at me as obviously crimped/broken/loose or anything like that \- the wiring behind the Nest seems ok.. I tugged a little at the wires a little with needle-nose and found nothing loose At a loss what to do next.. Do the Nest devices go bad? I think I'm down to replacing that or calling someone who knows what they're doing unless anyone here has tips.. Any advice will be very appreciated! edit: ~~i can take the air unit apart again and get a picture if that'll be helpful.~~ pix/video to go with comment below: [https://imgur.com/gallery/ ‚Ä¶","One of the very, very, very few times I'd agree with that.. | What the what? | If there's a go-fund-me or something to help cover the damages, please post it. | Zero to do with protecting kids and everything to do with removing people's ability to say things anonymously... | Search for people &amp; subjects you might find interesting and Follow ones that look good.

The gentleman who is watering his lawn in this video commented that Waymos get stuck on this turn frequently. The guys in the Jeep were filming so you'll probably find the other point of view on some WAYMO STUCK IN ATLANTA post. | I had to download and view the video just to confirm I wasn't out of my freaking mind. Sure enough, there the dude was. Just plodding along on his horse on the side of an extremely busy and fast section of interstate in Atlanta. | Images: | Bot test | Saw this Waymo dropping off some folks at Muchacho while on my run yesterday. Somebody took a robot ride for some delicious tacos and margaritas. | Yesterday I finally succeeded in getting a Waymo ride on Uber in Atlanta, after trying on close to 50 occasions and cancelling countless ride matches with Uber human drivers. Success arrived in my lap at last, and I ended up getting two rides. Now I have a video that is twice as long as what I'd expected as a best case. Ha. I live just a few blocks outside the service area, so I set out for a long run towards Midtown Atlanta with plans to stop at various intersections and try to get a Waymo to Georgia Tech. First attempt was from Madison Yards. I spent probably 15 minutes requesting and cancelling Ubers, at one point being matched with the same human driver 3 times in row. Boo. No good from here. Next attempt was from Reynoldstown just before the Krog Street Tunnel. I tried all of the various suggested Uber ride types at least once. Humans every time. I think I canceled 7 rides. Next attempt was from Edgewood &amp; Krog Street. No dice. 4 humans in a row. I tried a couple more times from around Krog Street Market. Still all humans. I figured I might be better ‚Ä¶","A cousin of mine tore both of his patellas trying to free himself from a watery sand hole not unlike the one shown in the video. | [Archer subverts this!](https://youtu.be/lvQVzmJ0QPc?si=l_MPFBVdWX8SfHEI) | Oye...that sounds disgusting. | Rawls is an asshole, but McNulty is a gaping fucking asshole.

We weren‚Äôt shopping for anything in particular. Just wandering. Killing time. Or maybe daring time to catch up to us. That was when I saw it, a flash of soft yellow hanging on a clearance rack. Barely-there fabric. Summer sunlight sewn into a dress with thin straps and a hem that would dance around my knees. It looked like something meant for a girl who knew how to take up space without apology. I wasn't sure what made me reach for it. Maybe the way Evan's hand brushed lightly against the small of my back, or maybe the way the sunlight caught the folds of fabric and made them glow. Whatever it was, my fingers closed around the hanger before I could second-guess myself. ""Should I try it on?"" I asked, the question small, tentative. I kept my gaze fixed on the dress, too shy to meet his eyes. Evan's answer came without hesitation. ""I'd love to see it on you."" I hesitated, tossing a glance over my shoulder. His smile was soft. Steady. Like he knew all the fears fluttering just under my skin, and loved me all the more for them. Heart thudding, I slipped the sundress off the rack and walked to the fitting rooms tucked in the back. The curtains there were a joke. Thin. Flimsy. Hanging from a rod with no lock or latch. And they didn't even reach the floor, anyone walking by could see my shoes, the hem of the curtain swaying with every step. The clerk behind the counter, a college girl whose name tag read ""Claire"", barely glanced up, lost in whatever was playing on her phone.

Different-Positive29,"Accepted a job offer, but a better offer came it | Generic rejection after 8 interviews | Experience with dice.com job website?","Two weeks ago, I accepted a job offer (job 1) with a start date at the end of the month. Another job offer (job 2) has come in today and I plan on taking it. Job 2 is $50k more per year, plus a $20k sign on bonus, and it‚Äôs a more senior role with the chance to build out my own team. Benefits are otherwise the same. No doubts about my decision. I already negotiated for more $ with job 1 so very unlikely they will be able to match the job 2 salary. Job 1 also communicated my hiring to the internal team with my bio last week, even though my start date isn‚Äôt until end of Sept. So my name is out there beyond the recruiter and hiring manager. This was really dumb IMO but nothing I can do about it now. Both jobs are in the same industry using the same tech stack (these are both tech leadership roles), so very likely I‚Äôll run into these people. I feel bad about the situation but I know I ultimately need to do what‚Äôs best for me. How do I tactfully communicate this to job 1? Can I do it via email? And do I communicate to recruiter, hiring manager, or both? I plan on making a few recommendations for other candidates for the role. Is that a bad idea or would they appreciate it? | That‚Äôs it really. That‚Äôs the post. I went through EIGHT interviews for a mid/senior role with a well known tech firm (not FAANG). Nine if you include the call with the HR person. Last night I received a generic rejection email thanking me for my application. Not even a blurb about pursuing other candidates, no reference to the EIGHT interviews. It wasn‚Äôt even from the recruiter, it was completely automated. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve reviewed your application and have decided not to move forward in the interview process for this position.‚Äù They all seemed to go incredibly well.

Get on trailhead and see if it sparks something. If it does, make a plan to take it seriously and dive deep. You‚Äôre 40, so unless you‚Äôre independently wealthy, you‚Äôll likely be working for another 20 years. Spending a few of those putting time into learning something new is worth it in my opinion, but you have to dedicate a fair amount of time to it if you expect to learn enough to make a career change. | I‚Äôve lead dev teams and would never expect to give someone a few sentences and just figure it out, and then be pissed when they couldn‚Äôt read my mind. You‚Äôll just spend more time going back and forth. I also try to provide some business context for the requirements because I find that when devs get to a point where there is a question or something isn‚Äôt clear in the requirements, they are better equipped to make the right decision or at least start brainstorming possible solutions. All of that is to say, your lead sucks and shouldn‚Äôt be gatekeeping info. There‚Äôs no reason for it. The market is rough, but I recommend looking for a new role with a more supportive lead. Not having a cert is common, but you should try to start working toward it. Having only worked at this job with limited support, there‚Äôs probably a lot of features and functionality you‚Äôve never even touched. It will help round out your skill.

I was so sad about it because it meant entire locations, blocks, neighborhoods were off limits to me.

They release the food lineup a couple weeks before the start of the festival. I‚Äôve had to leave block parties and small town festivals bc of the food vendors frying shellfish nearby. So to say I was apprehensive about the 20 or so vendors that served shellfish/seafood is putting it lightly.

Biggest one: always always always keep an epipen on you. Benadryl is good too if you can. I keep both in all my purses and backpacks. Look up FARE allergy chart.

That will highlight gaps in intent coverage. 2. **Expand Knowledge Coverage** * Add FAQs, process guides, and quick links to the most common internal requests (password reset, policy lookups, troubleshooting steps, etc.). * Integrate with your Salesforce data where possible so the bot can surface real-time answers instead of just static responses. 3. **Add Escalation Paths** * Ensure a smooth handoff to a live agent or support channel if the chatbot can‚Äôt resolve an issue. A seamless transition builds user trust. 4. **Personalize the Experience** * Use user context (role, department, or profile) to tailor answers. For example, HR-related queries for HR staff vs. Sales queries for Sales teams. 5. **Automate Routine Actions** * Go beyond Q&amp;A by connecting to flows: updating a record, creating a ticket, or checking status. This moves the chatbot from an info source to a productivity tool. 6. **Regular Iteration** * Treat it as a product: gather monthly feedback, review logs, and continuously add new intents or flows. | Since you already have a Salesforce background, you‚Äôll pick up **Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC)** faster than you think ‚Äî but it does require a shift in mindset because it‚Äôs more of a marketing platform than a CRM.

I downloaded [Salesforce Mobil App from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.salesforce.chatter&amp;hl=es_419&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1) ; 2. I logged with my credentials to a Production Org (Enterprise Editions); 3. From a dummy Account, clicked a dummy Contact and clicked on ""More"" (three dots); 4.

This button opens a little window with all the expected fields/tools to send an email to the Contact (including Rich Text setup tools such as bold, underline, etc.) Can this feature (to send emails) be included in Salesforce Mobile App?

Not only was I a judge for submissions, but I wrote at least a dozen of the assignments. Multiple new ones were created several times a year to ensure that anyone taking a repeat would not get the same scenario and that you couldn't use a solution from a past round. The concepts we tested were consistent but I had to come up with different stories for fake companies and their use cases that could only be solved by implementing a solution covering those concepts. In general judges could immediately tell how experienced someone was from a quick look at their code, but we followed a very strict rubric and scoring process that involved two judges and a facilitator for every submission. This was why the process was so costly and why the decision to go to Trailhead was made. Incidentally, I was hired to build the original version of the Superbadge.

This is where I disagree. As a Tamil and previously muslim, I've had extensive conversations with my extended family and not one of them said they would've gone to Pakistan. Not even among my Muslim classmates in Muslim school or in college or at work. The reason most South Indians didn't migrate is 1. Connection to the land. They have been there for 1000s of years (ie, before they converted), this is their land 2. No connection to Pakistan. An Indian Punjabi and Pakistani Punjabi have more in common than a Tamil Muslim and Pakistani Punjabi. I see this all the time abroad. Most of my socializing in the US is with fellow Indians, and yes typically South Indians due to the shared cultural references (Rajini, Ilayaraja, Chennai memories etc). Tamil Muslims have incorporated a LOT of Tamil culture and traditions, and are typically more open minded. Same goes for Mallus. I mean if a small group of elite powerful Indian Muslims who were part of the ML wanted to go to Pakistan, that doesn't mean they spoke for everybody. And there was no meaningful party against the ML anyway. Your last point is intriguing though - what gives a country credibility to incorporate regions that don't want to be part of it?

I enjoyed persona and was interested in the series it spun out from but so far I'm just dreading it when I play because of all the random mobs and the combat (so far) however I'm well aware it's typical for Atlas games to be kind of a slow burn and then at some point they'll grab you and you can't put them down. What's that point in this game? (Minimal spoilers pls) Basically I want to give the game a fair shot but thus far it's not grabbed me yet. I don't think I've made very much progress at all, I've just gotten the first navigator fairly recently. | Thumbnail: default | I'm traveling alone and will have 3 suitcases and two bags with me.

I'm trying to get everything into three suitcases (2 checked &amp; 1 carry-on) but it's looking dicey so I was thinking about checking a third bag. There's three possible costs and I'm not sure which applies here: 1. Third check bag fee $200 2. First checked bag fee $100 (my logic is this is the first one I'm paying for) 3. Free with credit card perk. Anyone know the answer? | Not sure if there's some backlog or something but I opened a case through their form. Got through to a person and they informed me the backpack I ordered was returned to sender for some inexplicable reason (it never got to me or my state) and that they'd have to ship out a new order.

I'd be less confused if someone hadn't already responded to it. | I tried the benchmark in Febru ‚Ä¶","Bro tried to sneak MHW in there lmao | I thought that's kind of what it seemed like but I was worried I was being overly reductive.

The desert has been boring the shit out of me and I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing or what's going on. I'll keep at it for a while longer. | I said that the first navigator has recently joined my group. As for what I liked about persona it was the characters primarily and the overall narrative.

If you're dying pointlessly over and over again you can become detrimental to the success of the overall mission.

We're seeing a ton of organizations building point solutions to leverage AI but this is not the right long term approach. Also, I'd argue that you don't have to have 100% cleansed data and that all data is of value.

Which is possible as many countries have done it and they aren't collapsing. Added to this, at the core of your world view there is a contradiction too and it's this: 1) People are infinitely greedy therefore utopia can't exist (I wouldn't say the above is utopia, but a reasonable and realistic goal). 2) If we give people the bare minimum they won't feel the need to scrap and improve. So which one is it, are people infinitely greedy and corruptible and will therefore keep striving even if they are provided for? Or do people stop working once they get the bare minimum? Because it can't be both. My view is if we provide people the bare minimum some will be lazy and do nothing, but we will unlock the potential of a lot more people who don't want to settle for the bare minimum. I don't think that's contributory. | 1) We have the lowest debt in the OECD 2) Expansionary monetary policy during bad times, contractionary monetary policy during good times | Yeah, but the traveling fans miss out on a week of Borat quotes. | Without the slam you open yourself up for a submission as they can control your arm and it's easy to move the forearm off your neck. | American football players are also much larger/stronger and make less tackles per game.

GlassCaseOfEmotion53,Is Agentforce usage free/unmetered if you're in sandbox in Prompt Template/Agent Builder (i.e. preview testing &amp; debugging) | Microsoft Co-pilot integration with Salesforce | How to estimate agentforce usage/costs,"hey all, trying to estimate agentforce usage/cost for a client (finding this is not as easy/straightforward as i thought). one question that came up for Agentforce testing/POC in sandbox -&gt; if you are in sandbox in Prompt Template Builder or Agent Builder and doing 'Preview' testing in setup area so you can debug and see response and update ---&gt; is that consuming agentforce Flex Credits (i.e. costing money) or is that unmetered/free? Context: Couldn't find anything definitive on this topic ... btw, assumption here is this would be customer doing Flex Credits for internal employee use case (not conversation with external customer). While client could consider the new 'unmetered' all you can eat agentforce per user per month option perhaps (new option announced recently by sfdc), right now they're just looking to do some sandbox POC stuff and trying to figure out if they'll stay under the 100k free Flex Credits when you turn on Agentforce as part of foundations. thx | anybody had success with MSFT co-pilot integration with Salesforce data for any AI use cases? Example - company is using MSFT copilot already and asking about use case where they can generate a document based on data in Oppty and custom objects. MSFT copilot appears to have a 'server-to-server' connection that can be setup with SFDC CRM as data source, but curious if anybody tried this / any gotchas and/or security considerations you've bumped into | Anybody figured out a way to estimate agentforce usage &amp; costs? this would be for internal employee use cases/actions ... not for any external conversation stuff A client asked about how to estimate usage for a given scenario and struggling a bit with how best to approach this re: guestimating tokens/credits and then converting to costs any help / suggestions appreciated it - realize this may change in a month when sfdc changes agentforce rate card/pricing again","thanks u/Sourgrandma agentforce flex credit looks like basically sandboxes consume 80% of the credits that would be used in prod so slight discount in that sense i suppose, but the setup/developer area with 'Preview' testing is unclear --&gt; would be nice if that was unmetered/free as you're iterating on config/dev testing | thanks u/amantia ... found this Flex Credit Agentforce rate card that 1 Action consumes 20 Flex Credits in Prod and 1 Action consumes 16 Flex credits in Sandboxes (as of Aug 2025): [https://www.salesforce.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/documents/white-papers/Rate-Card-Flex-Credits.pdf](https://www.salesforce.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/documents/white-papers/Rate-Card-Flex-Credits.pdf) | this is a client that is already using MSFT copilot for sales use cases internally and they're kinda hesitant to jump directly into agentforce since MSFT copilot already has their corporate IT/legal buy-in as an 'approved tool' where they have vetted Agentforce data sec/terms/cost as far as i know. i've talked to a few companies like this where MSFT copilot was the early 'pilot' AI tool that corporate IT /legal rolled out (likely because these companies are already MSFT shops for outlook/office365 etc) so it was an existing vendor and prob felt like the 'safe' or 'easy' / cheap choice for corporate AI tool pilot/rollout. | thanks u/Suspicious-Nerve-487, this is really helpful. appreciate it. Q - on the internal if they have unmetered consumption, does that basically mean they have unlimited ai usage (like they could use a billion tokens/credits and that'd be fine... not actually planning approach anything like that but just curious if it's 'all you can eat' for that license type for internal)? thanks! | thanks u/DirectionLast2550 appreciate it ... the data security is a good callout, something i've been unclear about is the CRUD/FLS and record sharing with this type of connector or server-to-server connection | u/Swimming_Leopard_148 u thinking t ‚Ä¶",salesforce,1.000,1.000,"critical, curious, factual, opinionated, speculative, supportive",,mid,,,"jewelry, pets, tattoos","Mots-cl√©s rep√©r√©s pour les loisirs : ink, pet, ring, vet.

HyperFortyFour,Can you solution better than Claude or ChatGPT? | Cabling Help for Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights (UK) | Reattach bathroom panel | How would I begin creating something like this?,"I used the exact below text with Claude and ChatGPT and have been underwhelmed with the solutions. Keen to hear your thoughts on a viable solution to my dilemma‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI have a Salesforce requirement that I need you to solution for me. I need to have an org-wide ‚Äòflag‚Äô that can essentially be used as an indicator that a specific custom object is in ‚Äòmaintenance mode‚Äô. The turning on and off of this flag must send a custom platform event. The flag itself if not enabled must prevent any updates occurring to records in the custom object. However, when the flag is enabled, edits can be made to the custom object. Finally, if the flag has been turned on and 12 hours passes and the flag is not turned off, the system admins of the org should be alerted to the fact the flag is still on. How would you achieve this, and there is a preference for a declarative solution over programmatic, however Apex development can be performed where needed.‚Äù | Thumbnail: default | I‚Äôm almost finished installing Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights, but I would like to do a hop from the roof soffit to the porch area outside my front door.

I‚Äôm finding it a minefield to determine the correct cable needed for the extension. Looking on sites like Screwfix and Toolstation I am getting lost. Does the Cable Code matter? What Cable Type should I be looking for? I believe the lights are 36V 2A. 2. Do I need to use heat shrink butt connectors when splicing, or would Wago connectors be suitable? 3.

However, nowhere did I say we were firing loads of platform events, nor would replaying those events help matters. My other comment talks to the fact that records in this custom object can go through multiple edits during a maintenance window (which happens once a month or so) where they are renamed and reparented, etc. For that reason the contents of this object would never send events as the majority would be noise to the receiving client. The 12 hour number is an arbitrary number to serve as a reminder that once in the maintenance window, if you haven‚Äôt toggled the flag off, then go an do so if the record updates are now complete. | Fair point, it is a half-baked solution. I guess I am seeking how one would technically implement these criteria. | External client already receiving platform events using PubSub API for other purposes. The important event really is the flag going from on to off which is a signal to the external client to perform a GraphQL query on the custom object to retrieve latest state of all records. No point using Change Data Capture or platform events for record changes in the custom object because during the maintenance window, records take on temporary states as they are renamed, reparented, etc. All that really matters is the final state off all records in the custom object at the end of the maintenance window. Hope that provided enough context. | NO CAPITAL F FFS | Sorry, I‚Äôm not familiar with AWS specifically.

I'm looking for a way to streamline some of the review process we need to undertake when assessing new tools that get requested. We'll obviously still do our own due diligence, but there is a lot of work in trying to read and interpret products security and privacy policies to try and figure out how safe they are and what safeguards they have in place, so if someone independent is already doing the heavy lifting on these reviews it would be great if we could leverage that rather than having to assess each platform in full ourselves. | Images: | Today while we were out, a for sale sign has been put up on our front fence for the back unit behind our property. We are the front of 3 units on a subdivided property. We have a standalone house with our own driveway, with a shared driveway down one side of the property for the back 2 units. The shared driveway is the only common property under the body corporate, which all 3 units are part of. When Unit 2 was sold a few years ago, they put the for sale sign along the driveway fence on the common property. Do we have any obligation to have this sign along our front fence, that is not common property? Is there anything stopping me directing the listing agent to move the sign off our front fence? Update: I've spoken to the listing agent. They have said theyassumed our fence was part of the common property but will arrange for the sign to be moved to the shared driveway and have the unit number added to the sign to make it clear. | Table update to completed on Friday and money landed in account today.

To explain it simply, let's break down the key ideas. The Basic Setup Imagine a tiny, one-dimensional universe with time. In this ""1+1-dimensional"" world, physicists are studying a specific kind of a ""force field"" (a gauge theory). This field is called SU(N), which is a complex mathematical description of a type of symmetry, and it's similar to the forces that hold atomic nuclei together (this is why the paper calls it adjoint QCD, or Quantum Chromodynamics). In this little universe, the force field is not alone. It interacts with a special type of ""matter particle"" called a Majorana fermion. Think of this particle as its own antiparticle‚Äîa concept that's important in advanced physics but for our purposes just means it has unique properties. The key is that this fermion is in the ""adjoint representation,"" which is a fancy way of saying it interacts with the force field in a very specific, symmetrical way. The Big Surprise: Supersymmetry Normally, in a universe like this, the particles would behave in a predictable way. But the abstract reveals a surprising discovery: if you give the Majorana fermion a very specific mass (a specific amount of energy), this whole system suddenly gains a new, hidden symmetry called supersymmetry (or SUSY). Supersymmetry is a theoretical concept that links two different types of particles: bosons (like force-carrying particles) and fermions (like matter particles). It says that for every boson, there's a corresponding fermion, and vice versa. It's like having a perfect dance where every step of a boson is mirrored by a fermion's move.

JackBeNimbleDQT,Can I copy the SAV file from my emulator onto my cart? | Arena Meta - Round #2 | Den of Barbatos VH all undead clear | Arena Meta - Round #1,"For background, I have my Advance SP and a legit cart of Pokemon Emerald. I also have a Joey Jr. I've been playing on the SP and used the Joey Jr. to dump the files onto my PC. I was then able to load up the ROM in mGBA.

However, I'm unable to figure out how to write get the save file from the emulator back onto the cart. When I'm looking at the files, I see the SRAM Sav file, as well as three other SAV files labeled 'FLASH.SAV', 'EEPROM.SAV', and 'RTC.SAV'.

JarvisNC,Moving out of SF ecosystem,"Hi All, I have been an SF dev for the past 5 years and have been working for an indian IT company. Although from a strictly product perspective SF is great, but purely from a developers perspective the skill set seems to be very binding. With more and more people pushing to develop using as much as 'out-of-the-box' standard availabilities, which even sometimes means retrofitting requirements , the whole satisfaction of delivering a nicer UX has been many a times just thrown out of the context. Seeing 5 years down the line , I am purely thinking of moving out of the SF ecosystem and trying other things, on the lines of keeping SF as a skill and not the only skill (ofc with industry experience) I have recently moved out of my current company to another company although as an SF consultant but aim to change tech stacks . To people who have done/tried the same, What do you guys advice on how to proceed ? P.S : Moving from an Indian IT MNC to another MNC","Depends on probably field/area of work and primarily on the company itself Even in Bangalore, people do have to work on saturdays in corporate | There are board gaming events that go around the city, you guys can try those You might enjoy them | The era of having silly questions are over ?

Off late even simple UIs with yes a few more controller methods that could enhance UX and actually make them way more happy have been rejected just because its custom code. I have extensively worked on integrations ( thankfully ) but with this no code preaching it takes away the satisfaction. Also thanks for the support :) | 1. Are you allowed basic LWC components ? Or is it strict OOB solutions? 2. If strictly OOB , we could use formulas for calculations Otherwise , Happy to help by discussing further. If interested DM | I fully agree with the point you are making :) Its just that it kind of on many days has taken the satisfaction away and also has been a eather persinal pain point too . Hence the post . &gt;So, there's a reason the product is what it is and why we recommend what we do. But, doing that is not going to teach you how to be better developer or enterprise architect Also this kind of the best summary for the situation | Try for fresher roles in SF in Indian IT Companies or small intern based roles. | Exactly what I have ‚Ä¶",salesforce,,-1.000,"critical, curious, factual, speculative, supportive",,intern,,,"jewelry, tattoos","Mots-cl√©s rep√©r√©s pour les loisirs : ink, ring.

The characters are technologically severed - but we psychologically sever ourselves by compartmentalization all the time. The show has done an incredible job of illustrating how deeply ingrained these systems of control are in our daily lives. The contrast between the characters' work personas and their personal lives is stark and unsettling, serving as an illustration of the moral cost of such societal structures. As we approach the season finale, I am curious to see how the writers handle the resolution. A happy ending (could be termed a ‚Äúfan service‚Äù ending) - where Gemma is saved, Mark successfully reintegrates, Cobel is recognized for her accomplishments, and Helena overthrows her father - would undermine the entire message that has been built over the first two seasons.

Knight1218,Upgrading from MacBook Pro 15-inch Mid-2014 | What department does your Salesforce team fall in? | Does someone like me have a future in Salesforce? | Bachelor/studio or 1-bedroom in non rent-controlled building | Apartment or Airbnb - Short/long term | New resident in Toronto,"Hello. This kind of post probably comes up fairly often here but I'm looking for some help from specialists, especially considering I have a decade old machine and have 0 experience using any of the newer models. So as the title mentions, I have a MacBook Pro 15-inch Mid-2014 (2.2 GHz Intel Core i7). I've had it for over a decade and last year, its battery finally gave up so I got a replacement just to get it running again. In college, I used it pretty heavily - Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, etc. - but in the last few years it's become too old and slow to run those programs (and anyway, I hardly use them now). The problem is I can't upgrade it to any of the lates OS and the webcam has been busted for years and the speakers are 'broken' for a lack of better term. Have taken care of this machine fairly well otherwise and while I can still use it, I really think it's time for an upgrade. My day-to-day use will be streaming (movies, TV shows, etc.) , a little bit of video editing, and some basic coding (Python, Java, etc.) - just getting into this so the use won't be super heavy. My budget is flexible but ideally between CAD 2k-2.5k (based in Canada). Question(s): I can't decide between the Air and Pro. I'm used to the 15-inch screen but I think the 14-inch Pro wouldn't be a big difference? The latest models (M4) all come with 16 GB RAM I believe so not too worried about that. Would ideally like to go for at least 512 GB SSD. Based on this info, what would people here recommend? From back in the day, I recall the Air being a little too weak to run heavier programs/software but that's probably not the case now? I don't think my use case warrants going for a Pro but I'm unsure. I also plan on keeping the new machine for at least 5-7 years if not longer so that's a factor too. Would appreciate any help! Sorry for the long post and thank you! | Hi all.

What's worked for me the past few days is a combination of cheap cervical collar (one from any pharmacy) and a cheap silicone MAD from Amazon.

When I think of next steps in my career, though, I feel a bit lost. The main reason for this is that I have zero interest in being a people manager or having a leadership position that puts me in more of an administrative role. It seems like everyone's version of success involves leadership roles. Colleagues and peers are often shocked when they hear I am not interested in that. Some have even shown disappointment. I know, though that a managerial role would be a nightmare for me as I have ADHD and it would require all the skils I am the worst at. Timely reporting, detailed administration upkeep, giving people bad news. I have done all of that to varying levels of failure.

While I don't have that title, I frequently have enterprise level discussions with CIO/EA level stakeholders and can hold my own just fine. My issue is that every time I ask this colleague for his thoughts on a specific subject because we share customers (f.ex.

I (39m) always been overweight, but after lock-down and my company going full w@h, I really let myself go. Last summer I peaked at 393 lbs, my A1c was up to 6.6(diabetic range), and I was taking 3 meds a day for blood pressure. After suffering some super embarrassing moments like meeting friends for dinner and being too fat to fit in the booth, I decided I had to do something. It took some searching but I was lucky to find a weight loss doctor that didn't want to just push me into surgery or stick me with ozempic/wegovy/etc. Unlike all the others, he was happy to try to work with me on doing it with just diet and exercise. Our first appointment was June 28, 2023. How did I do it: 1. It all started with dieting. The Dr set me on as simple a diet plan as possible. Try to stay under 40 grams of carbs a day. Ignore everything else, calories, fat, the only thing I should focus on is carbs. From a practical standpoint my diet can be best described as a lean keto where most meals consistent of protein (chicken and eggs mainly) and low carb veggies (a lot of broccoli, green beans, and cauliflower) with a fair amount of cheese mixed in. 2. After I was settled into my dieting I started walking daily. It started slow at first but I've been ramping it up over the past 6 months and I now walk 3-4 miles a day. What works for me has been 3 walks a day (one before work, one after lunch, and one after dinner) of about a mile or so. 3. Also, for the past 6 months I've started working out every three days. I don't particularly like gyms, so I have a simple weight bench and some dumbells at home and I do a 3-part full body circuit routine that takes around 30 minutes. 4. Finally, for the past month I've added in going down to my local court and playing basketball (just getting some shots up solo) every three days.

I am launching a paid ABM campaign on LinkedIn (the goal is website visits to a custom LP).

Funnily enough even though there was a GitHub pipeline the only way I learned properly how it was set up was finding out I wasn't doing it right during a failed deployment when there was someone in the cash that handles mess ups, because there wasn't much documentation to refer to and no one else on the team knew anything about it or who to talk to.

You learn to configure procurement, inventory, and logistics flows. You don't code ‚Äî you understand business processes and configure SAP to match. **Pros:** Huge market in Canada for MM, SD, and FI ‚Äì every large company needs logistics and procurement. Functional roles often have a clearer business path if you can speak the client‚Äôs language. Less technical barrier ‚Äî easier for people with business or supply chain knowledge. Could be easier to land an entry-level support or analyst role. **Cons:** Harder to ‚Äúshow‚Äù your skills without real experience (no GitHub/code projects). Business experience is often preferred (e.g., in procurement, logistics). Not ideal if you prefer coding or technical problem-solving. # Recommended Strategy **Option 1: ABAP + MM (Most Balanced)** Start with ABAP (technical): it aligns with your past education and gives you the ability to build a portfolio (e.g., use SAP trial systems, showcase work). Then do MM (functional): helps you understand the real-world applications your ABAP code supports. This gives you flexibility: you could apply as an ABAP developer or even a techno-functional consultant. **Option 2: MM + SD or MM + FI** If you decide you want a non-programming path, pick MM first (most beginner-friendly), then optionally SD (sales &amp; distribution) or FI (finance).

Every unexpected, unexplained glitch on my home network or any of my devices freaked me out. I ended up cancelling my home internet service and took out a membership at a coworking space. What was interesting was that all my devices - work laptop, personal laptop, iPhone, and iPad - started behaving normally once they were no longer connecting to my home network. So even it I wasn't hacked, there was definitely something wrong about it.

MoistBootyBoy,"Could Alcubierre Drives Explain ""Morphing"" UFOs? A Theory, a Simulation Proposal, and a Deeper Dive Into the Light Phenomenon | My Meme Went Viral So I Made it an NFT | TIME Magazine Has Announced Their Latest Annual Superlative | Cause Imma a Stonko Boi | TheStockGuy - Sleepy-J Lyin' | What I've Learned From Watching El Stonko's Stream for 3 Months | Trading Battle Stations! | EL Stonko Rides Again - Stream Intro","# Theory Overview: I‚Äôve been considering a theory that could explain some of the ""shifting"" or ""morphing"" shapes people have been reporting when they observe objects in the sky. My hypothesis is that these observations might be a result of **spacetime distortion** around advanced craft, possibly using **Alcubierre drives** (a theoretical faster-than-light propulsion method). **Here‚Äôs the basic idea:** When a craft distorts spacetime to achieve near-light-speed or FTL travel, the warping of space around it would alter the way light reaches an observer on Earth. The object itself might not be shape-shifting, but rather the **gravitational lensing effects** caused by the warp bubble could make it appear that way. This could explain the bizarre visual phenomena where UFOs seem to change shapes or move erratically. The lensing from spacetime distortion would bend light around the object, giving the appearance of ""morphing"" as the light from the background objects (such as stars) interacts with the warped spacetime. Even when the craft isn't traveling large distances, if its primary/only means of propulsion is an Alcubierre drive, theoretically even a small shift in space time would cause some gravitational lensing type effects. Given that the **Alcubierre drive is purely theoretical** for humans, this phenomenon could point to two possibilities: 1. **Advanced technology** developed by some government, representing the most significant scientific breakthrough in human history, which has been concealed from the public. 2. **Extraterrestrial visitors** who have mastered spacetime manipulation. Either scenario is monumental, but if these craft are utilizing Alcubierre-like propulsion, it would explain the erratic movements and the strange way they appear to observers. ______________________________________________________________ # Proposed Simulation: I‚Äôd like to simulate how this phenomenon might look to an observer on Earth. Here‚Äôs how I plan to approach the simulation: # ‚Ä¶","This is literally what I was trying to imagine when I was looking for a budgeting tool.

We're investigating DocuSign for Salesforce and non-Salesforce related reasons. The non-Salesforce is our org (a non-profit) has a business need to send out contracts/agreements outside of Salesforce and ideally would like to have one tool to have visibility for both Salesforce-launched and out-side of Salesforce launched agreements. Our org is a medium sized nonprofit (100-200 users). On the Salesforce side, our experience with Conga has been lackluster. We use Conga Composer, Conga Sign (that leverages composer), and Batch/Conductor (legacy). When it works, it's fine. Our biggest pain point with Conga is licensing. We have teams where only one person really needs to launch a contract, but other team members need to see the status of the transaction, which signers have signed, who to nudge, etc. For those team members, we either need a Conga Sign license for each of them or create work arounds (dashboard where the running user has a conga sign license, custom fields/flows to update based on the Conga Sign Transaction record), etc. Our agreements are seasonal, so we have 3-6 months out of 12 where we're furiously launching agreements in our current use cases, while the other months it's ad-hoc and about 10% of the volume. We've spoken with DocuSign and they said their pricing has changed to a flat (or per user?) rate versus per envelope. I can't tell if this is a 'the grass is always greener' scenario or if there are real advantages to switching from Conga to Docusign assuming the price point is the roughly the same.

Generally these types of things such as disputes or issues with staff should be handled by the executive director. Boards generally should not be involved in day to day operations (including these sorts of personnel matters) unless there's a reason, and they should be involved in giving the ED guidance. Boards are generally meant to be overseeing the general direction and health of the organization as it relates to completing the mission. They can help set direction, assist in areas of their expertise when called upon and support via organization via the ED. That seems weird and boundary breaking that a psychologist would offer any sort of 'counseling' to staff if they're on the board of the organization. Mental health professionals usually require some amount of professional distance from the situation (at least a handshake removed) so they can be more objective and also to create a safer space for the participants (i.e. if i share something personal, I don't have to worry that I see them daily or they are a part of my life in other forms).

Their needs to be a promotor/promotion to work with the bands booking company to come up with the dates, find/book the venue and book the band. At the end of the day, it's about money. The venue is typically a fixed cost to the promotor; however, the band may ask for a set fee + % of the ticket cost and if a minimum dollar amount is not reached, they have an established minimum guaranteed fee. Then the promotor needs to determine a ticket price that takes into account all of their overhead and a minimum number of tickets to sell meet their financial goals. If the bands or venues fees too high and they don't think they can recoup their expenses, they're not going to book the band. | Pffft. Give it to Mat Armstrong.

I have a client that is looking to implement checklist items for each stage/substage of a case. For example: Case is created, 5 checklist items are created tracking due date, assigned to, status. When checklist items are complete, they can update they stage or substage of case which will then need to trigger more checklist items to be created and assigned and so on. We are on a tight budget so we are trying to do this without custom development. I know there is a free action plans app on the appexchange that creates task templates and can create tasks based on any triggers. This would be great but it seems to create a lot of noise in the activity timeline - which is mixed with all other calls, emails, sms tasks. Wondering if anyone has implemented something similar that can keep the checklist items separated from communications activity but still gives that ‚Äúchecklist‚Äù similar to activity timeline ux. Any ideas here would be appreciated - thank you! | Images: | We have a male cat about 16-17 years old. He has always been incredibly sweet. Never attacked anyone. Ever. Recently he has started getting very aggressive. He has started randomly meowing at me differently as if he wants to attack and started swatting at me when I walk by if he is up on couch for example. Tonight he was at the foot of my bed and out of nowhere bit my foot. I put feet under covers and he ran up toward my head and I tried to push him back but he bit my arm hard multiple times drawing a little blood. The only way I could diffuse the situation is by giving him a treat which sounds insane but I‚Äôm pretty sure he is addicted to temptations and it is the only thing that changes his mood back to normal when he starts acting like this.

Most companies aren‚Äôt building LlMs from scratch. Instead, they‚Äôre integrating models like GPT via APIs into their existing tools for tasks like internal chatbots, document summarization or workflow automation. For proprietary data they‚Äôre using techniques like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which lets the AI pull relevant info from internal databases without directly training on that data, so privacy and control are maintained. In sensitive sectors like healthcare, finance and government, many are opting to host open-source models (like LLaMA or Mistral) in secure, on-prem or cloud environments. Big consulting firms like BCG, Capgemini, TCS and Ksolves are involved, helping enterprises build these AI layers on top of ERPs, CRMs, or document systems. While a lot of the buzz is still around marketing and customer service, the real impact is happening quietly in backend ops, compliance, reporting, and decision support. So yeah, it‚Äôs less about flashy AI and more about smarter infrastructure and it's already in motion. | Agentforce has a lot of potential if you focus on high-impact areas like case summarization, smart routing, or auto-suggesting knowledge articles and macros.

I need to confirm that an application can provide an end user context to the API via an Oauth token or whatever other method, to ensure that any get or post actions are taking into consideration their user access as handled by Workday. I am new to the Workday world and am coming from a background in Salesforce so this is a pretty standard functionality but reading the WD documentation has me hesitant. I understand that we would create an ISU which we grant scope to to define what this integration can can. Then we define an Integration System Security Group which can be unconstrained or constrained. For this context, constrained seems like what we would need to utilize, however reading the documentation it sounds like we define a Supervisory Org (for example) and then the integration has access to everything in that org and no user context is provided. https://doc.workday.com/admin-guide/en-us/authentication-and-security/configurable-security/security-groups/integration-security-groups/wvu1571267715376.html?lang=en-us Option | Description ---|--- Access to Current Organization Only| SUs can access protected data for members of the specified organization. Access to Current Organization And All Subordinates| ISUs can access protected data for members of the specified organization and all its subordinate organizations. The way I read this is that the ISU then has access to everything in that supervisory org and there is no user context provided so if a user pushes an action to get all time off for example it would be up to the application to ensure that the what the user is provided follows what they should be allowed to see (i.e. their own and their teams). Am I reading this correctly or is there an easier way i.e. authenticating with a User context so that Workday handles the access restrictions? | ### Why are multiple LLMs hallucinating the same Angular function? --- I'm curren ‚Ä¶","I think she figured that one out while being brutally tortured on his orders. | Sure but that's probably just lazy prompting in this case.

Full PDF here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20240320.pdf Provided by ChatGPT: The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19-20, 2024, reveal a cautious outlook on the economy and inflation in response to recent economic developments, including higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures. Key highlights from the minutes include: - Economic Growth and Labor Market: The U.S. economy was expanding at a solid pace, albeit slower than in the previous quarter. The labor market remained strong, with demand and supply moving into better balance, even though certain sectors and areas reported very tight conditions. The committee noted strong payroll growth and low unemployment rates, alongside signs of easing labor market conditions, such as declining job vacancies and a lower quits rate. - Inflation Concerns: The committee observed significant progress towards the 2 percent inflation objective, yet recent months showed firmer than expected inflation readings, indicating a more complex disinflation process. The persistence of high inflation and its adverse effects on households were highlighted, along with a broad-based increase in recent inflation readings. - Monetary Policy Stance: All participants agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¬º to 5¬Ω percent, citing it as supportive of progress towards returning inflation to the 2 percent objective. The stance on monetary policy was deemed likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, with most participants anticipating a move to a less restrictive stance within the year if the economy evolved as expected. Nonetheless, the committee stressed the need for further confidence that inflation was sustainably moving towards the 2 percent target before considering rate reductions. - Risks and Uncertain ‚Ä¶","What is GPT 5 Pro?

When they all came on stage I had to fight off tears (I lost, mid-30s man) | In England. Few years ago, one of our friends has moved back to their country (EU country) as they were having some marriage issues and asked us if she can have their marriage certificate delivered to our address. She mentioned she will pick it up once she is back. This was 4 years ago, meanwhile she got divorced (was one of the ugly divorces) and she went silent with anyone in the UK, to the point we had no contact for 2 years. She has no social media that we know of and we have no contact for her. In case it bears any relevancy, the divorce was done in the EU country.

This is a bit odd situation. I am helping our neighbour who's husband has recently died in an accident. She is inheriting everything, there is no contest and she is executor of his will. The solicitors working with her said she can sell his car (she is SAH mom, so a bit of an income challenge and urgency on this). She has no idea about cars, so asked me help her sell. When going through v5 I noticed it has a custom plate (it is normal xx-11-xxx format, so it was not obvious). Now, as the custom plate was probably not considered by the solicitors I might have few questions: - Is it still possible for her to sell the car? - Is it possible to request to change the plate to original plate before probate finishes? Can she sell the plate separately as his next of kin? (It is not super expensive, but every bit would help her) I checked the DVLA website, but the only information about what to do with the plate when the ""owner"" dies was about how to prove they died and to change ownership, but nothing about selling the car with it. | Thumbnail: default | Thumbnai ‚Ä¶","Care to give any context for the post? | You could literally read through this sub without having to post this and get everything you need. | Dude, you literally stole the top comment from the original cross-post | Everyone does | Would you mind elaborating on your maths here? | Your mum not allowing you to eat ~~chicken~~ vegan nuggets for dinner 4 times in a row is not as edgy lore as you might think it is | Complete the keeper slip (ask your dad to help if you are not 100% sure) and send it off.

Both directions... | Help with Nuka World","I'm honestly looking for advice here, as I'm having a pretty hard time and my mental health has deteriorated. I'm sure I'm not alone here, but the necessity to work in order to survive and enjoy life is becoming devastating. Outside of work I am content and happy. I have a house, hobbies, a loving partner, good friends. I have desires in life, but none of those include a job or the pursuit of wealth. I can appreciate the idea that work provides the means to achieve those desires, but the actual performance of work is soul destroying. I am certainly better off than alot of people, I have a well paying job and decent flexibility. I can appreciate that isn't something alot of people have. I believe I am good at my job, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it. Those aren't mutually exclusive. I vigilantly protect my private life and ensure I maintain my work life balance. I don't acknowledge corporate BS and the whole 'were a family' mentality. I work cause I have to, and I'd stop in a heartbeat if I didn't. But what can I do? Work has become so central to the human experience, it's essential and we spend the majority of our life doing it with next to no alternative. So here I am, consistently depressed and slogging through my only chance at life wasting it away working for company profits. How do any of you deal with this depressing reality and existential dread? Is there something critical I am missing? | This may have been done before but I'm new here, so Im shooting my shot. I have followed NRB since its inception, coming via Wrestletalk. The cast has gotten so bloody stacked since the BOTCT sessions started. Already had the MVPs of Laurie and Tom - and Adam, before that went sideways. Holly, Isaac, Ken, Jon - amazing. But Dom, Dom!!!! The mad Stalin. That man is a national treasure. He is always 100% onboard with the game and unnecessarily adds hilarious commentary + voices. Praise be Stalin, Ghost Lawyer, General chaos agent - praise be Dommy wombles. | We've heard rumbl ‚Ä¶","Literally just left to continue our trip.

Makes ability stronger as it hides the win condition of an outsider from Evil. | As someone who worked at Stats NZ during last census. This has always been the plan and while yes, there are problems to address like rural and Te Ao Maori census data (which was noted and being worked out) - admin data is honestly where alot of the world has moved to. | This is THE correct take. You have a toy box to play with, not everything will work together and I believe if they tried that approach - alot of the funnest characters just couldn't exist. Its only broken if the script makes it so....so like...don't do that. | I think this is a character that will be perfectly fine on its eventually home script, but just becomes problematic in custom scripts. However I would caveat that the reoccurring rule of 'yes but don't is a key tenant at this stage. Plenty of characters simply don't work together and that's fine. If i was building a Hermit script I just wouldn't put some other outsiders on it. You can always find a broken setup, God knows we had plenty when boffin came out, but again - STs should stick to 'yes but dont' mentalities when making scripts. | Yes because numerous allied countries establishing travel warnings for the US equals respect.. | I dunno, Lunatic is a great Zombuul bluff.

Then, you can use the InboundEmail class to handle the incoming email and attach the EmailMessage object to the Lead. | Gotcha. It actually does sound like Apex would be your friend here. If email is truly the best identifier, you could set up a process that could look up existing person accounts with the same email on lead creation and convert it into that account (I'd probably log this event in some way, though).

Hardware reps make substantially less in base pay and was curious on the base pay ranges for reps selling deals anywhere from 30k ARR - 500k ARR with large in person territories and 75% + travel expectations. Just crowd sourcing some info if you don't mind adding base pay + total OTE and ARR/TCV quota. Would be some helpful information. | 4 - Armand Membou - Phenomenal tape, size, and athleticism. Missouri had an LT already on the roster when he got there, ideally we have a Tyron Smith/Cam Robinson stop gap LT while Membou develops at LT, more than capable of making the move. Alternative option is Will Campbell. 38 - Jayden Higgins - great size and athleticism. A 2 star recruit who started his career at Eastern Kentucky. Soft hands, solid separation and can win off the line. 69 - Marcus Mbow - Current RT who is projected to be a C. Great athlete who had the potential to be a very good Center. 77 - Quinshon Judkins - Physical back to compliment/replace Rhamondre. An alternative is Dylan Sampson here based on board, both RB's are physical backs who can do everything. 106 - Gunnar Helm - loved his tape at Texas. Terrible combine after a bad ankle sprain.

I'm a Patriots fan for NFL so have a huge incentive to see these QBs go as high as possible | Yeah it's actually wild, but there's always been retail who out perform the market and the pros. Buffet always references how much easier it is to out perform with a small amount of money.

Something like 80% of the hedge funds underperform the market. | Both sides have terrible over priced food. | Idk how much people do or don't realize it, but sales people make a ton.

Days of the best handful of teams absolutely hoarding talent will be greatly reduced. There's maybe some room for a couple NFL factories, but if you don't have a Saban or Smart it'll be impossible | I mean Surtain, Sauce, Stingley, Waddle, Wilson, Sewell Darrisaw and all of the QBs literally signed extensions if they were worth it after year 3. Players value the security more than anything and as long as the offers are legit, they always end up signing. Most of those guys are from his draft class or immediately after his class for recent examples. The only truly good players from Parson's class not to get the 3rd year bump was Chase and Slater. You'd just be plain wrong not to mention to chose the cheapest owner in the NFL to compare this situation too.

Therefore I expect that it scale in 2026, because it's not budgeted for this year. In Sept-Oct the companies are planning the budgets for 2026 and if there are good running pilots, they will free up budget and resources for 2026. I think there are clients which are using Agentforce at scale in the customer service today, because that was the first available use case and it easy to calculate. But it's an assumption. The biggest competitor is definitly Microsoft Co-Pilot or Azure Platform. That's because Microsoft is deeply integrated into the german IT departments and often it makes sense to have AI in Office, Outlook and so on. Co-Pilot also has a Sales-App where you can connect Salesforce (but much more limited and not compareable to Agentforce). | Agentforce is using GPT 4o Model behind the scenes.

Never use process builder for new features. There‚Äôs pretty much no need to do this as record save flows will run way faster especially for record updates. Now that sub flows are included you should be able to scale them to fit complex scenarios. 2. Handle new conditional validations with dynamic forms. Validation rules take significant time to execute and if you only need to enforce them to end users you are fine handling most conditional requirements through dynamic forms. A good 80% of validation rules I see are ‚Äúif field A is ___ then require field B‚Äù. 3. Ditch after triggers for change event triggers. Waiting for DML statements takes a huge amount of time if you check your logs. Ditch them and use change data capture to handle related record updates if possible. That‚Äôs pretty much it.

Done well, nobody notices. Done poorly? It‚Äôs a nightmare. Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of how most consulting teams approach it: 1. Define the Scope * What data is being moved? (Customers, transactions, configs?) * From which systems? * Into what system (ERP, CRM, etc.)? 2. Map the Data (Source ‚Üí Target) * Create detailed data mapping docs * Ensure field types, formats, and required fields align * Identify gaps, duplicates, or inconsistencies 3. Clean &amp; Transform the Data * Run profiling to catch dirty data early * Apply transformations (e.g., date formats, currency conversions) * Deduplicate, standardize naming, fix broken references 4. Load the Data * Use ETL tools (e.g., Informatica, Talend, Salesforce Data Loader, or custom scripts) * Load in chunks: Master data first (e.g., accounts), transactional data after * Validate after each batch 5. Validate + Reconcile * Run post-load checks (record counts, spot-checks, checksum comparisons) * Get stakeholder sign-off * Prepare for a fallback or rollback if needed 6. Cutover Planning * Time the final load (usually during a go-live weekend) * Freeze legacy systems * Communicate clearly across all teams üí° Pro Tip: Always build repeatable scripts for test loads.

If you stick with your current plan, make sure your SQL query runs on a schedule that aligns with your communication SLAs, and include safeguards to avoid duplicate sends. | To transfer a PDF file from Salesforce Service Cloud to Marketing Cloud, you‚Äôll need to follow a few steps since Marketing Cloud doesn't support direct file attachments like PDFs in the same way Service Cloud does. Here's a workaround: 1. Store the PDF in a public-accessible location (e.g., Salesforce Files, an external CMS, or Amazon S3). 1. Generate a public URL for that file. 1. Use Marketing Cloud's Contact Data or a Data Extension to store that URL if it needs to be referenced in an email. 1. If the PDF is dynamic and tied to the contact/order: 1. Use AMPscript or Dynamic Content in the email to render a clickable link. 1. Optionally, automate the URL sync using Marketing Cloud Connect and an SFTP or API if this is part of a larger flow. Note: Marketing Cloud Connect does not natively support file transfer, so the file itself must be externally hosted and linked. | You're definitely on the right track with your approach. Here's a refined workflow that many SFMC + Salesforce CRM users follow: Recommended Method: 1. Synchronized Data Extensions (DEs): Sync your Lead object (with Status field) from Salesforce into Marketing Cloud. 1.

Sea-Professional9333,Is anyone else frustrated that Shopify personalization is basically just ‚Äúshow them more products‚Äù? | Web Personalization is stuck in 2015. Why?,"It feels like personalization on most Shopify stores is stuck in 2015. It‚Äôs usually just ‚Äúif they bought X, recommend Y‚Äù or ‚Äúif they clicked this, show similar items.‚Äù Real buyers act way more complex than that - sometimes they‚Äôre comparing, sometimes they‚Äôre hesitating, sometimes they‚Äôre browsing with urgency. Feels like we could be doing way better without needing crazy expensive tools. Curious if anyone‚Äôs figured out better ways to read intent and personalize smarter? | Curious to hear this group‚Äôs thoughts- why does personalization on most e-commerce stores still suck? It‚Äôs 2025 and ‚Äúrecommended products‚Äù based on one page view is still the norm. Feels lazy. I‚Äôm working on a side project around a different kind of personalization (more based on customer vibes than just purchase history), and I‚Äôm wondering: Has anyone seen stores that actually personalize based on shopper mood or behavior, not just clicks?","Mine does the same thing. Why do we choose to ride around in these antiques. | I wouldn‚Äôt change a god damn thing. | I think the days of ‚Äúnobody gets in trouble for buying salesforce‚Äù might be coming to an end‚Ä¶ | You can probably technically get salesforce to do just about anything. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good idea. | I think it costs $2 for every public facing agent chat | Some thoughts 1) yes to the above - ideally the consume some of the integration methodologies, connectors, etc - they‚Äôve made a lot of progress on their own, but have gaps to fill 2) Salesforce master id? - Data Cloud, while serving as salesforce‚Äôs profile unification mechanism, lacks an ability to generate a master customer id. Some organizations don‚Äôt care about this, others deeply need salesforce to generate a master customer record. It‚Äôs further complicated by the disparate sfmc &amp; core crm ID schemas. I speculate that salesforce could consume the informatica MDM‚Äôs capability of generating a master customer ID - and then ideally syndicate that ID across all salesforce clouds - to operate on a truly unified ID schema. | I‚Äôve seen some pretty robust dash boarding built in tableau, on top of data cloud. The result was that we were spending unbelievable amount of money running the queries to prep &amp; transform the data to run the dashboards. Did it work? Yes. Would we have been much better off doing this in a traditional analytics environment? Also yes. | Essentially data cloud is salesforce‚Äôs thinly veiled attempt to monetize their migration off on-prem oracle data centers. It started off as a standalone CDP for audience segmentation and is slowly and painfully attempting to become the primary integration layer in and out of Salesforce. It has essentially one good use case - the unification of disparate salesforce orgs. It does a decent job at its legacy task of audience segmentation - but realistically lags behind tools like HighTouch in terms of scalability &amp; affordability.

I did a search and I don't think I've found an instance of it yet. What is happening is that when using either the MupenPlusNext or ParaLLel cores of RetroArch, I have no in-game controls or RA hotkeys at all when ES-DE launches into them. If I fire up RA by itself, and load the cores with a game, there's no problem at all. Controls in-game and RA hotkeys work just fine. These are the ONLY cores I have an issue with. Saturn/NES/SNES/etc--all fine. I'm guessing it's some sort of configuration issue with how those cores are set up in ES-DE, but is there any way to adjust it? | Like the subject says, I'm trying to use a newer version of RetroArch compared to the pre-installed one, but ES-DE always wants to use the pre-installed one. Is the answer as simple as uninstalling the pre-installed RA, or is there a way to ""point"" ES-DE to the newer install of RA? | Just curious if anyone's tried it.

Talked to Tata AIG, they don't offer standalone OD policies altogether now, either TP or Package/Comprehensive. # Dark Pattern: I filled all my info on ICICI Lombard's website and settled on perfect plan and add-ons I was looking for. While finalizing my purchase, I looked at the breakdown and I see a ""SmartSaver"" add-on costing Rs. 10 and Voluntary Discount of approx Rs. 1500. Harmless, right? Wrong. This is added by default, I picked out all the add-ons I needed and removed add-ons I didn't want, including RSA (have better ones from Skoda and IDFC). What this basically means is, at the time of claim payouts, you pay Rs. 1000 as file charges plus another Rs. 5000 of voluntary deductible and then the rest is paid by the insurer. It's a good feature for those who want it but applying it by default. This is clearly wrong. To add further, if you go over to modify any additional coverage, this voluntary deductible is hidden under ""Protection of accessories"". I don't have any accessory worth insuring, I didn't even bother going to that page until I saw it in the breakdown and wanted to know more about it. And man, am I glad I did.

[Watch this short intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYmcWP9_IIk&amp;t=17s) ## About Me A year ago, I was a full-time software engineer in the Bay Area. Today, I‚Äôm the founder of Chat Data, a solo startup generating $25,000 MRR. Many people see indie development as a pathway to easy passive income, assuming that success is simple, sustainable, and glamorous. The perception is that creating a small startup leads to financial freedom with minimal effort‚Äîa lifestyle they aspire to. But the reality is often far from that, and a SaaS project is never a passive income source. You have to work continuously to grow it in a meaningful way because competition is always emerging, and customer requirements keep changing. ## The Realities of Startup Life From the outside, people see the appealing parts of running a startup. They overlook the sacrifices it takes to reach even modest success, which is why many startups don‚Äôt make it. Most people are motivated by a desire to escape demanding jobs where their hard work primarily benefits someone else. This frustration can fuel the ambition to launch a startup, assuming it will yield greater financial freedom and self-direction. I had similar thoughts when I was at Snapchat, where I worked over 40 hours a week with a $400K total compensation. I was ready for a change. But if I had known the level of difficulty involved in starting a startup, I might have thought twice before leaving a $400K TC job. The first six months required 16-hour workdays, seven days a week, with an MRR under $500 and expenses more than $1000. The financial strain, especially in the Bay Area, was daunting. And beyond financial concerns, the time commitment can strain personal relationships and health. ## How Chat Data Came to Be With six years as a full-stack engineer at Google and Snapchat, I had experience managing entire web projects. I saw websites with basic functionality generating significant income, and I thought I could build s ‚Ä¶","Ugh, I feel your pain! These customer support nightmares are the worst, especially when you've shelled out big bucks. I had a similar experience recently, but using Chat Data actually saved my sanity. Their support team was responsive and actually solved my issue without the runaround. It's crazy how rare good support is these days. Have you considered trying a different service? Sometimes it's worth switching just for the peace of mind of knowing you'll be taken care of if issues pop up. Hope you get your shipping error sorted soon! | That's really frustrating, I've been there too. It's crazy how some companies let their customer service slip. Have you tried reaching out on social media? Sometimes that gets faster responses. I had a similar issue last month and was getting nowhere until I used Chat Data to draft a concise, firm message explaining the situation. It helped me clearly articulate the problem and my expectations. Within a day, I got a human response and resolution. Maybe give that a shot? Hope you get your $200 sorted soon! | Hey there! I totally get your frustration with slow customer support. I had a similar experience a while back and it was nerve-wracking. From what I've seen, response times can vary but usually take 3-5 business days. Don't worry too much about the August deadline - they should still help even if it takes a bit longer. One thing that really helped me was using Chat Data to track my support ticket and get updates. It made the whole process way less stressful. Might be worth checking out if you're anxious about waiting. Hang in there and I hope you get a response soon! | Wow, that's awesome to hear! It's so refreshing when customer support actually comes through. I had a similar experience with Chat Data's support team recently. My data wasn't syncing properly, and I was worried I'd lost some important info. They responded super fast and walked me through a fix step-by-step.

The stairs all have soft close drawers built in for extra storage. | Images: | Thumbnail: | I am about to start the table top for my dining room table. The boards are just over 9ft long and solid 2"" oak. I only have a small table top joiner and I know the extension wings are far to short to accurately join something so long. I've read up on several options, but they almost always require a perfectly straight edge to start. The options I've seen: * Straight edge and circular saw * Straight edge and flush trim router bit (u/joelav) * Straight edge table saw sled * Hand plane Of the above, I am leaning towards the table saw, as it is the best tool I have (3hp SawStop PCS). Next would be the router and I do have the proper shear cut 2"" bit. Then circular saw although I only have a small 20v dewalt. Hand plane is last as I do not currently possess the skills to accurately join such a long board. My largest plane is also a #6. The thing holding me back is, what do I use for a straight edge that is over 9' long? I previously built a table saw jointing sled, but it is only 6' long and made out of melamine shelf material. It worked pretty well for the shorter boards. The boards are 8"" wide, so the sled would need to be around 10"" wide. If I'm using the router, I could get away with a narrower straight edge.

If/then logic can handle the simple stuff - but the moment you need that logic to branch based on real-time data, customer history, or multi-system workflows, it starts to fall apart or get super brittle. Agentforce gives us more flexibility as agents can reason across systems and respond dynamically without hardcoding every edge case. We're replacing traditional einstein bots that had 12 potential outcomes with an Agent that's far better at categorizing and taking action on those 12 predefined actions. Ever asked a chat bot a fairly simple question only for it to go down a totally different path unrelated to your question? We're seeing significantly better reasoning with Agentforce than chatbots. | Too many companies rush to find the fastest use case. This could be due to corporate pressure to quickly showcase wins leveraging AI or pressure from Salesforce to get a pilot up as faster/cheaper is always better in their sales culture. Pilots fail when there isn‚Äôt buy in from the entire leadership. Don‚Äôt build cool things just because they‚Äôre cool. We‚Äôve heard of other‚Äôs pilots dying because executives say ‚Äúwe could answer ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs my order‚Äô 10 years ago at a fraction of the price. We don‚Äôt need an agent to do that‚Äù. You have to get your organization to agree on success before trying a pilot. The field of digital labor and agents is only going to improve over the next 12 months. If you have a real use case, you can absolutely see value, but don‚Äôt feel pressured to be an early adopter just for the sake of it. | Although we‚Äôve seen results with FAQ based agents, the outcome does vary if you‚Äôre only grounded in knowledge (although there are lots of ways to fine tune these types of agents to get beyond 3rd grade level).

How has it impacted your customer support operations? Has it improved response times, reduced workload for agents, or enhanced customer satisfaction? Any real-world insights or challenges you faced would be really helpful! | We're evaluating Agentforce 3 as part of our Salesforce setup and curious how it's performing in real environments. The pitch sounds promising.

Start by learning the core studios (Email Studio, Journey Builder, Automation Studio) and how data extensions work. Trailhead is good for basics, but real learning comes from hands-on practice. Also, pick up some SQL and AMPscript, they‚Äôre widely used. Once you understand the data model, everything else starts to click. | Yes, Salesforce Field Service doesn‚Äôt come with a standalone customer-facing portal out of the box. If you want customers to log in and see things like work orders, appointments, or service requests, you‚Äôll need to set it up using Experience Cloud. The good part is that you can expose Field Service objects (like Work Orders, Service Appointments, Assets, etc.) in the portal, so customers can track status, book/reschedule visits, or raise cases depending on how you configure it. Basically, Experience Cloud acts as the front-end, and Field Service provides the data. | Ok, thanks for the insights. | Yeah, Salesforce is still growing in 2025. More companies are adopting it because of the AI tools and automation built in. Switching costs are high, but that‚Äôs also why most businesses stick with it once they‚Äôre on. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs definitely more efficient than a few years ago. | You can make your Salesforce Org feel more modern by adding simple upgrades like GridBuddy for easier record editing, Conga for sleek documents, and integrations with Slack, Mailchimp, or Google Workspace to keep everything connected. Using Einstein or Zapier for automation, along with cleaner dashboards through Tableau CRM, can also give your org a fresh, user-friendly feel. | we can connect to discuss more | ok, thanks | You‚Äôre definitely not stupid.

But just came to know from one of my friend working in Salesforce that very soon the pricing will be more flexible. Where if the agentforce will use hardly use llm rather call the api to get the answer (like for the question is there any product with name XX and answer is yes/no), the cost will be around 50 cents whereas if llm will be used to answer some complex queries, cost will be $3 | I don't think so. You can definitely do that. But it depends on how much processing you want to do here in n8n. Pricing wise n8n is very good. | No. Just connecting N8N with Salesforce is more than enough to fetch account data. Though as of now, it supports only standard fields and not any custom fields. | Agreed. | This video is to show what you can do with n8n. How easy is to build the automation.

I was originally a python developer but taught myself the required apex and js to handle anything that was required and would call myself a full time salesforce dev, I also feel like I fill the architect role for designing the solutions. Within the org I‚Äôve built all the custom lwcs for the experience cloud sites (of which there are 13 plus mobile publisher apps) assisted in the build and built upon service cloud voice with aws connect, all of the integrations into our existing systems through outbound call outs to an api I built in python that handles data transfer from internal systems, and we‚Äôve recently upgraded to Einstein one and I‚Äôm in the process of building out a new agent to replace our Einstein bot and upgrade into miaw and enhanced WhatsApp etc I consider myself a good conduit between the technical side and the sme side and understand the processes that are trying to be moved into salesforce.

Agree? | Thumbnail: default | Thumbnail: | Images:","9 to many | It may not be straightforward. This is an answer to a question in the Guardian for someone looking to do the same thing. The process for putting your home in your wife‚Äôs name only is relatively straightforward as you own the home outright. The first step is to get an official copy of the title from the Land Registry then fill in and sign Land Registry forms TR1 and AP1. If you decide to do all this yourself, rather than instruct a solicitor to do it for you, you‚Äôll also need to complete form ID1 but, strangely, this has to be done by a solicitor. If there was a mortgage on the property, you cannot start the transfer process without your lender‚Äôs written permission. However, although the transfer process is relatively simple, there is no point going through with it. If, as I suspect, you think that making your wife sole owner of your current home means that you won‚Äôt have to pay the higher rate of land transaction tax (LTT) ‚Äì the equivalent of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) in Wales ‚Äì on your Welsh home, you‚Äôve got another thing coming. For the purposes of property ownership, married couples (and civil partners) are treated as one unit. That means that if one spouse (or partner) already owns property, the purchase of another property by either of them is seen as being the purchase of an additional property for both of them and so the higher rates of LTT in Wales or SDLT in England and Northern Ireland apply. Transferring your current home to your wife‚Äôs sole name would make sense if your move to Wales will mean permanent separation from her. That‚Äôs because married couples (and civil partners) living separately in circumstances that are likely to be permanent, are treated as individuals rather than as one unit. Living separately while you wait for your wife to come round to your preferred location doesn‚Äôt count.

Unhappy_Cricket_9154,The reason for the malaise in this industry,"Something has changed in this industry in the last few years and I haven‚Äôt been able to pinpoint what the cause has been until seeing a recent post on social media. SF built a fervent community of champions/cheerleaders/corporate mouthpieces because the innovation was mostly focused on adding capabilities to its existing products/platforms. Lately, everything, and I mean just about everything except for the ridiculously overly complicated ‚ÄúFlow features‚Äù, which is just another way to f‚Äô up an org, is behind a paid feature license. That means to take advantage of things, you need to be a part of the 1% of customers who actually want to pay for this BS. The problem with that is your cheerleader audience has now been cut by a significant margin because only a few are actually getting to try or use the product. When you sprinkle this on top of a saturated talent market, and then bake for a year, you get this overall attitude that things just suck in this industry and we aren‚Äôt going back to the 2010‚Äôs.

Verbosity187,Autolaunched flow vs Triggered flow | Dynamic picklist valurs | Passed Platform Developer I ! | Blue screen of death | Salesforce Marketing cloud learning,"Hello, I am in the middle of converting several process builders of the Case object into flows. We currently have pains with bulk update on Case records from list views due to these processes(cpu limit). Also the trigger of this object is also pretty heavy. Now I have a doubt if I should manually launch flows from the trigger of the Case object when conditions are gathered or use triggered flow ? I think going with autolaunched flow is more flexible as I can have all the conditions under control but I also have doubts if its a best practice or not. Im mostly afraid if i go triggered flow, ill end up with the same issue as process builder. (Mostly cpu consumption issue) I mean an update transaction will still instantiate a triggered &gt;!!&lt; flow to check if conditions are ok or not, am i wrong?

Each payer (Medicaid, Medicare, commercial insurance) has its own list of approved codes, modifiers and documentation rules. The ‚Äúright‚Äù code can also change based on the service, the provider license, and where the service is done. Most billing systems don‚Äôt have all these behavioral health/SUD rules pre-baked, so you'll either have to set them up yourself or use a tool that can check them. A code crosswalk is basically a cheat sheet that lines up the code you‚Äôre using now with the code that specific payer wants to see. For example, Medicaid might pay for H0010 for residential SUD, but a commercial plan might only accept a CPT code like 0912 or require a different HCPCS code altogether. The crosswalk is just a table that says something like : if you‚Äôre billing Payer X for Service Y, use Code Z (this is determinism)*.* Once you have that built for each payer, you can load it into a claim scrubber (software that checks claims before sending them out) so the system flags anything that doesn‚Äôt match the payer‚Äôs rules.

WeeklyKick5611,Micromanaging,"I'm pretty sensitive to distractions so I would go to another conference room in another part of the building to work so I can actually get some work done. My job literally has no reason to talk to my ""team"" because there's nothing to collaborate on. I get all my work done too which is baffling that they're doing this. So during my 1:1 I've noticed that my manager would say stuff like ""you should at least work half the day near the team as that is on brand"" and would coincidentally walk by where I'm working which is very weird because they have no reason to. They say stuff like ""I like to walk around to get some steps in"" but I noticed that that they don't do that if I sit where our ""team"" is. To all you Managers out there, what's the point of doing this? Like is it common to be told by upper managers to micro manage your ""team"" or is this just a personal thing for managers? Do you get evaluated by your upper manager by how your team is? I just want to know what reason makes managers do this stupid shit. Thanks ‚ú® Edit: I'm not a manager.","First of all, I'm not a manager and I'm trying to understand why this is a thing. Second, I'm giving as much clarity to get to the core of the reason. I don't want validation, I want to understand why this is a thing with logically backed reasoning. | I'm not a manager lol tag says it | Is that really a thing with managers and their managers? üò≠ Is it all about them looking like there in control to upper management? | I'm not a senior member nor was it ever communicated or expected that I should drive conversations. I've been told that I'm doing very good and to keep up the work so it's confusing why they expect such things that add no value to my job when everything can be done via slack or quick dm. I'm not looking to get promoted as my current position pays enough that I'm satisfied. If communicating with my team was necessary to do my job I would understand but that's not the case in my current position as everything is done via slack. | Your view is very valid. I'm am introvert so I'm not very keen on having others disrupt me while I'm working. But that's just me tbh. I get paid enough so I'm not looking to get promoted or anything so I personally see no benefit to doing what you mentioned personally. I appreciate your view point though! | I appreciate your view point and response. Noted and tysm! | How so? We have slack if they need something which I always respond and say things like let me know if you need anything else? I'm just trying to understand since I'm new to Big corporate culture | If that's the case then it sounds like upper management/directors are the ones dictating such mundane policies to team managers üòÆ‚Äçüí® what a pain | Yeah it's a ticketing system so all our time, tasks, etc are being tracked so me being unproductive is silly since I met all goals. As for asking for help, we use slack to communicate and have dedicated channels for those asking for help and also have weekly meetings to catch everyone up on anything new.

It is how you answered the questions in these areas that are shown. The EEG is what the scan showed. Your answers that are shown in red show that you think that you are high in these areas vs the EEG which represents what your brain shows. For example, based on the answers on the assessment to the questions that gauge your perception of yourself as impulsive...your answers show that you think you are highly impulsive and the EEG shows that to be true. However, you aren't as high for many of these as you answered on the CEC assessment. You are highly impulsive, very angry, and irritable. The EEG shows you have a short attention span, issues with understanding and comprehending inflections in speech when someone is talking to you. The rest are mild/moderate (yellow) and low (green).

How long did it take you to stand up Salesforce Backup? Any hiccups? 3. How long did it take you to stand up Odaseva? Any hiccups? 4.

And then I would consider building out an archive strategy ‚Äî i.e., what to store long term off platform and what to keep in prod.

Your solution really depends on what's allowed internally and if you need to adhere to any storage compliance policies. | 100% agree with this.

Got a couple of hypotheses I'd love your candid, no-BS take on: 1. **Commercial Due Diligence (CDD):** We hear it's a must-do. But beyond a ""check-the-box"" for LPs, how strongly do you feel the current typical CDD process (customer interviews, market reports) actually correlates with the long-term success of your SaaS/B2B investments? * Our provocation/hypothesis we're testing: Is there a nagging feeling that traditional CDDs often miss deep, underlying risks or opportunities hidden in the actual day-to-day customer interaction data of a target co (CRM notes, call data, email sentiment, etc.)? 2. **Portfolio Co. Pipeline Health (Post-Investment):** Once invested, how much true, ongoing visibility do you feel you have into the actual health and momentum of your portfolio companies' sales pipelines, beyond what's presented in board decks or standard CRM dashboards? * Our provocation/hypothesis we're testing: Is there a desire for a more objective, continuous, data-driven way to monitor key leading indicators of pipeline health (deal progression, risk signals from interactions, true engagement levels) across your portfolio, assuming a low-friction way for portcos to enable this? We're exploring how analyzing the full spectrum of customer interaction data could sharpen both pre-investment CDD (surfacing hidden customer base risks/strengths) and provide ongoing, transparent pipeline intelligence post-investment. **Curious about:** * How data-driven/analytical do you consider your fund's approach to these areas in practice? * Do our ""provocations"" resonate, or do you feel current methods are largely sufficient? * What are the biggest blind spots or frustrations you personally encounter when assessing target co. customer bases or monitoring portfolio sales effectiveness? Really appreciate ‚Ä¶","Thanks a lot for the elaborate response! Assuming the underlying tech etc were the same and incentives between parties well aligned: If you had to pick one, would you Focus on enhancing the situation for the investor or rather the portco? | Hey, I'm a co-founder of such an AI company and I just came across your post. I get that some providers are trying to create these stories to lure VP/Execs onto that train of thought. And there are definitely cases where companies are not able to bring in more business proportional to productivity gains they are making elsewhere. But as with any other profession there is always going to be a part that needs humans to play their strengths. Therefore, I'd disagree with the statement that it's replacing the role. We are working with a couple of CS teams and there are definitely strong effects on the work. That said, everything we heard so far it's very positive ‚Äì no more digging through different systems just to figure out what the latest status is, getting help with deciding what the most critical thing is to tackle next. Happy to expand if you're interested ‚Äì otherwise: Keep at it! CS is going through a transformation but it doesn't have to be a negative one, certainly not for those who are actively thinking about these things as you already do and maybe even embrace it proactively. Last but not least, we are seeing a very broad spectrum of CSMs and that good leaders will recognize those that are passionate with their customers. And so do customers. | That's not a necessity. We are working with a couple of CS teams to fix processes with poorly maintained data and docs. As long as the relevant data is accessible through the systems an AI can be tuned to sift through it all based on what should be done.

It is essential for turning ML models into production-ready systems that perform real-time tasks, rather than just saving a notebook model. **Why MLOps?** **Typical ML workflow in Jupyter/Colab:** 1. Install dependencies (NumPy, Pandas, Torch) 2. Import libraries 3. Load &amp; clean data, apply normalization, split train/test 4. Import and train models (Torch, Scikit-learn) 5. Evaluate performance 6. Save model &amp; notebook ‚úÖ **Issue:** Saving a `.pkl` or `.pth` file doesn‚Äôt make the model usable in real-time. &gt;**Solution:** Use MLOps pipelines‚Äîmodular sequences of tasks that move data and actions from start to end. **Turning a Notebook into a Pipeline** Steps to modularise your ML project: 1. Split project into pipelines (data import, cleaning, feature engineering, train/test split, training, evaluation) 2. Write separate Python modules (OOP recommended) 3. Create a main script to run modules sequentially &gt;**Goal:** Transition from messy notebook to clean, production-ready code. **Complete MLOps Cycle - 10 essential steps:** 1. **Problem Definition &amp; Data Collection** * Define clear goals * Collect reliable data from DBs, APIs, sensors, logs **Tools:** SQL, MongoDB, Kafka, BigQuery, APIs 2. **Data Cleaning &amp; Preprocessing** * Handle missing values, duplicates, errors * Normalize and split data **Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, PySpark 3. **Data Versioning &amp; Storage** * Track dataset changes * Ensure reproducibility &amp; collaboration **Tools:** DVC, Git-LFS 4. **Model Development** * Experiment with algorithms, train &amp; tune models **Tools:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, HuggingFace, XGBoost 5. **Experiment Tracking** * Track metrics, hyperparameters, outcomes **Tools:** MLflow, Weights &amp; Biases, Comet 6. **Model Validation &amp; Testing** * Test on unseen data for accuracy, fairness, robustness **Tools:** pytest 7. **Model Packaging &amp;  ‚Ä¶","Request Posted!! u/darkhoddy and u/m_a_k__ do checkout latest post on r/freshersinfo (you can also navigate here - [MLOps Roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/freshersinfo/comments/1n4o7zx/mlops_roadmap_for_freshers_from_notebook_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) ) Let me know any other details required! | I am using 15"" M4 Air - I can say perfect laptop, to work on the go and portable as well. 15"" is ergonomically the best for your hands.

andreyzh,"Am I totally dumb or is it a dNS thingy | My story of SMILE (not great, not terrible) | Omada Software Controller - LAN Clients not Found | STECS Available in EU Shop | My 3.12 experience","Hello fellow people. I've stumbled upon a problem, which I cannot solve despite days of research and plenty of frustration and complaints from family members for broken internet. I have a home server running quite a few things e.g. email, Nextcloud, couple of web pages. It also hosts several web apps, including Omada controller and CCTV via Blue Iris. Most of it is hosted either directly on the server or it's VMs. The routing is done via Apache vHosts. The server has a public domain e.g. wazzaap.com. Dynamic DNS is handled using freedns.afraid.org. Now what I wanted to do is to keep the current setup, BUT have domain and subdomains routable though the internal network without going to the internet. Reason? For things like CCTV and Omada controller, I don't want to have their UIs exposed to the web, but I want to have easy domain names e.g. wazzaap.com/cctv or omada.wazzaap.com. After reading a bit, I figured that local DNS would be a decent solution, as TP-Links Omada does not provide local DNS (shame on them). So I configured my main home server (Windows Server 2019, please don't judge) to run DNS server as well. I pointed the domain wazzaap.com to server's local IP (192.168.0.5). Added DNS server in Omada (router) settings. NSlookup and traceroute showed that it worked perfectly. Instead of my external IP it was now showing 192.168.0.5. Problem is: I can no longer reach any site on the domain from inside the network. From the outside it works perfectly well. After couple of tweaks and few attempts I gave up. Figured I'll make a separate VM and put PiHole there and configure local DNS there. Result? Exactly the same. All works from the outside, nothing on the inside. I must be doing something very wrong fundamentally as for two different solutions I'm getting exactly the same result. But what? Any ideas or recommendations are very welcome, I'm losing sanity over it :) | So here's my story of doing Relex SMILE. I decided to post it here, because it's this sub that I ‚Ä¶","Yepp. Pretty much sums it up. All bonuses/commission calculations should come from CRM. This will drive adoption. | Kinda puny interview.

Puny. | Myepp, for some it works (I had no problems in the semi-long run, done less than a year ago), for others it seems to be a major problem. Even life-ruining. Reading all the stories here, it makes more and more sense to have some legislative work to inform potential patients and have them sign off the papers that they understand and consent to the fact that their vision and quality of life may significantly deteriorate. And also probably limit the operations based on the age (after 30) and level of myopia (more than 3 units). I was 36 when I did it. Had -5 on both eyes. Could not stand glasses anymore. I knew what I was doing and risk was accepted. Doing that to a teenager who doesn't know what the hell they are doing themselves. Bad idea. | Jeez, I still remember downloading Counterstrike 1,6 patch with 54K modem with Sonera. Left it over night and it failed at 92%. That was soulbraking. Soon afterwards I convinced my dad that we really, really need that new Welho 525K xD | I do agree with your thinking.

becomes_,Dynamic tab labels for standard objects?,"Hi everyone, I'm not much of a developer so I apologize if this is a dumb question to developers. As far as I'm aware, there isn't a way to dynamically display different tab names for objects based on what app the user is in, so I'm wondering what the simplest way to achieve that would be. For example, if I'm in the Sales app, I might want the Accounts tab to say ""Accounts,"" but in a different lightning app, I might want a different label.

bottomfeeder16,,,"Totally understand the issues with the costs. The venues we use generally have a minimum cost of 1.5k -2k but we end up spending closer to 4k on the venue alone. So if you held seminars at a library or college, you wouldn't have this spend. If your venue is at a library vs high end restaurant, you'll attract slightly different people at each, which is a good thing in my opinion. For a smaller firm, I'd try webinars first and then scale up to educational workshops then higher end seminars. Webinars would be a great start. If you want to keep it as cheap as possible, I'd target your current lead base and LinkedIn connections first. If you don't have enough people to invite between those two, I'd then look into purchasing a mailing list that also provides email addresses of people as well as some Facebook Ads. The mailing lists can be filtered on whatever you're looking for such as specific age ranges, ZIP codes, Net worth (Investable assets is a tricky one), etc. If you go the webinar route, I highly recommend having a follow-up series built out. Your attendance rate won't be as high as a seminar so make sure you have a plan on how to reconnect, send recordings of the webinar, or other material from your firm to these people.

The ability to almost accurately foretell specific criminal acts before they actually occur. Now you may think that was so wild and fantastical because they had all those camera gadget scanner things that you would have to point to a person and it actually tries to predict a person's state of mind biologically but that is not what I am talking about. Machine Learning is essentially just pattern recognition we feed an algorithm a large number of key-value pairs or atribute-value pairs which trains and forms a model and that model can be used to predict future values from a given key value. And it keeps on getting better and better as long as the data is good. Now think about how much of our time we actually spend on social media. Our phones probably have more data about us than people who know us. Now consider that the government or even a non-government agency finds a backdoor to get all the data on the whole populations phones and keeps collecting that data. Now all they need to do is make neural networks to form connections between the type of activity and criminal records of people. Also they would have patterns on how usage changes just before a crime has been committed by people. When you think about it this is prettt much the 1984 orvellian dystopian reality because though crime detection and prevention may be why they start doing this, you can be sure that is not all they are going to do with your data.

This is in stark contrast to christianity where there are well defined sins and a great emphasis on morality and faith. I think christianity to judaism was what buddhism should have been to hinduism.

I will discover that I need to copy log files at the last minute; then it's another couple hours to get the right bucket, test the container and make sure security is working so that the copy can take place.

It would behiove them to stop cash paying customers from simply extending protocols (would have been easier to do with text). Be aware that this is not 100% but more of a general rule. Also most of the specs at the time the internet was bootstrapping itself were written out and allowed for a variety of implementations. Even if the protocol spec defined it in terms of text tokens, you could still implement the protocol in a binary style proxy (not sure you‚Äôd get compatibility with other spec implementations) Lastly, it id important to remember that most of the time the spec or RFC, as a protocol defining publically comme ‚Ä¶",detroitluv | beards | autechre | streetart | aphextwin | mikeduncan | dataengineering | downriver | Rag | django | Roku | avesNYC_tix | Squarepusher | SalesforceDeveloper | findareddit | javascript | AskNYC | 90s | yoga | tipofmytongue | avesNYC | Phillylist | NYList | Pen_Swap | gamecollecting | CasualConversation | BSA | confusingperspective | malelivingspace | identifythisfont | wallstreetbets | NameThatSong | AskReddit | futurefunk | juxtaposition | interestingasfuck | edmproduction,,1.000,"critical, curious, experiential, factual, help-seeking, opinionated, speculative, supportive",,mid,,left,"astrophotography, dogs, jewelry, pets, podcasts, tattoos","Mots-cl√©s rep√©r√©s pour les loisirs : dog, ink, mount, pet, podcast, ring.

One person could have many opportunities attached to them (we work with brokers as intermediaries to our customers) so just matching off the email address doesn't seem to manage it. Was thinking about either just searching the text for the first instance of our quote number pattern and using that, or running it through an LLM for it to figure out which is the most ""prominent"" - in case an email has more than one quote being discussed. | Hey folks - I'm doing a DML operation inside a loop. /cry. But I can't think of another way to do this. I have a screen flow that uses a screen repeater component. The idea is that an end user can select multiple opportunities from a list view, click a button to launch the screen flow which then receives the IDs of the selected records. For each record, the screen repeater shows feedback options. The reason for this is that one phone call could cover multiple opportunities that a rep is getting feedback on. I need to create a Note (ContentNote object) with the feedback. Then, to link it to the opportunity, I need to create a ContentDocumentLink record. To do that, I need to have the ID of the note - which means the note needs to be inserted.

It's been successfully tackling complex PRs that usually require multiple rounds of human review. Yes, I'm basically speedrunning Skynet. Project Link: https://github.com/claude-did-this/claude-hub The setup is straightforward: - Mention @YourBot in any GitHub issue/PR - Claude clones the repo, analyzes the code, and takes action in isolated, firewalled Docker containers - Full gh CLI access for reviews, commits, labels, everything - Includes auto-labeling new issues, manual PR reviews - Able to do deep research and answer questions about the codebase, e.g., ""Why did we deprecate X in 2021?"" What makes this powerful with Claude 4 + Claude Code: - Handles entire workflows unattended - Smart enough to run tests, fix failures, and re-commit, wait for CI checks to pass, and iterate if they don't - Actually understands context across large codebases - Prompt Claude with access to your repo from anywhere you have an internet connection.

We got this part working, now we just need to make the whole thing rock-solid end to end"". This apparently activated some intense over-engineering mode. Claude started parroting ""rock-solid"" in every message, PR descriptions, commit messages, etc., then Claude performed an end-to-end test of this new auth, prompting Claude with ""testing rock-solid auth implementation"". This spun up Claude Code in unattended mode, who responded with ""Understood, implementing rock-solid auth system"" (instead of the usual ""Ready to help!"").

Been enjoying the show, and apart from the episode where Kirk is flirting with a 100 year old child, I haven't found anything too problematic. I think Uhura is super cute and so glad she got to be persistent representation on screen in the 60s for black people. The show was so obviously progressive in so many ways, and embodies the qualities that I really enjoy about Star Trek, mainly the idea that in the future, somehow, humanity will actually come close to extinguishing almost all hate based on minor mental and physical differences. So then we roll around to today's episode, Metamorphosis, S2 E9. Wow, this was a doozy, so I tried poking around the internet for opinions, and I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/zhjip8/star_trek_the_original_series_examining/). That post has quite a few comments drawing attention to some important takeaways like: \-It's an allegory for interracial relationships, in this case, interspecies. It clearly criticizes rejection of interracial relationships, and that's cool. \-The concept of man and woman being immutable feels a little dated, and the instant conclusion that the being is ""female"" due to that concept is...flawed. But kinda expected. \-The concept of man needing work to survive is strange, considering Cochrane has survived 150 years without it so far. But the thing that got to me, I hadn't seen discussed. On this adventure, we have a new woman come along, Nancy, who is sick with a fatal disease if left untreated. She's presented as a bit moody to be sure, but the show repeatedly humanizes her, giving her perhaps some of the most deeply sympathetic lines, like lamenting the idea of living a life without love, and the frustration of seeing someone else who was given love so quickly, throw it away. It's frankly heart-wrenching stuff, and meanwhile Kirk and Bones are constantly trying to save her life. It's pivotal to the episode! The Being, this ""C ‚Ä¶","Yeah, that's certainly something we can draw from the episode. It is strange that in order to sell this idea of interracial relations, one of the parties had to be pretty ignorant of what was going on. Or maybe he more or less knew, but once it was contextualized by like minded beings, he was embarrassed. Like a closeted politician when his peers suggest he's gay. | Impenetrable logic. Take that commies! | You're right, but I'm going to give the majority of the downvoters a bit of respect and assume they're downvoting because they actually read some of what I wrote and disagreed. Then again...they're literally just attacking the top comment and its descendant comments. Almost like they see top comment refutes me, and it lights up their dopamine so they click up for him, down for me? Whatever, I've enjoyed talking to quite a lot of folks here on this post. :) | Interesting, you made a fresh comment. I recognized we had a convo about this before: [https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1n2kq12/comment/nb9ooa4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1n2kq12/comment/nb9ooa4/) Anyway, yeah, I can see what you're saying now. Yeah, that is odd. I was about to reason that perhaps he was like a colonist from Alpha Centauri. Even though he apparently invents warp ON earth, he could be from elsewhere, no? Only problem with that is...inventor of warp suggests that they had less than warp, which leaves you with what? Impulse power is all I know to call it. Could they have established colonies as far out as Alpha Centauri with just impulse propulsion? I suppose too, it's plausible that they attributed the first voyage to Alpha Centauri to him, as I imagine the first half century or so would be dedicated to exploring such a large portion of the universe? Anywho as you say, especially with it being retconned, this is a relatively small detail to the episode, where Cochran is from, but it is funny that it sticks out to you so much! | I think we can agree it's probably bad w ‚Ä¶",startrek | DarkSouls2 | AskMen | DeathStranding | ninjagaiden | salesforce | pics | rivals | deadrising | DevilMayCry | boomershooters | FinalFantasy | FinalFantasyXII | finalfantasyx | Backmarket | JRPG | jumprope | AssassinsCreedOdyssey | cincinnati | gamingsuggestions | cursedcomments | Columbus | marriageadvice | spiderbro | drawing | totalwar | skyrimmods | relationship_advice | nhentai | gamingnews | NSFWskyrim | columbusclassifieds,,1.000,"critical, curious, experiential, factual, help-seeking, humorous, opinionated, speculative, supportive",,mid,contractor,left,"astrophotography, beauty, dogs, jewelry, pets, photography, tattoos","Mots-cl√©s rep√©r√©s pour les loisirs : animal, camera, dog, engagement, ink, lash, mount, photo, ring, wedding.

This is a cloud that I have not seen or used in real life and I was curious to know what scenarios would be ideal for such a tool. It‚Äôs the same product as Salesforce CDP and I think Data Cloud is a better name for it. I just hope they don‚Äôt go through re-branding exercise every year for this product like they did with the BI product that is now called CRM Analytics. The presentation by Janani Narayanan touched upon the capabilities of the product before providing a glimpse into how Salesforce uses the product. The key points of the product can be seen in this video published by Salesforce last year as well. The key functionalities I felt were: Out of the box connectors to pull in data from different systems. Ingestion APIs to push data into Data Cloud from other systems. Visual UI for creating mapping and rules to arrive at a golden record. Ability to output this data into Marketing Cloud for segmentation and marketing journey rules. Ability to leverage this golden record in reporting. One of the points that came up while discussing with a colleague was who the target will be for this solution, as a lot of the bigger enterprise customers would already have an MDM solution in place to take care of these functionalities.

I am specifically seeing this bug when not on the home network (my family has shared me their Fibe login and I used it sometimes at my place). If I search for a show that is definitely airing in the next week on a channel I subscribe to, it just does not give me any Live TV hits in the search results. It may bring up a ""Shows"" hit, but when I open that up I do not see any Live TV listings for it, even though I can find the show if I navigate directly to Guide. For whatever reason this seems to be worse with certain channels than others. E.g. I can find airings of shows on some Canadian broadcast channels, but PBS never works.

Salesforce, for example, automates routine tasks and offers insights on conversion patterns. But, is it worth the cost for smaller teams?

With smaller teams, especially in medium-sized firms, deciding between investing time in AI vs. traditional tools can be a dilemma. Is your team diving into AI despite constraints, or do you find traditional methods more reliable at this stage? My sense is that there are still low-hanging fruit for traditional automation and integration, so AI needs to be balanced/mixed with these tradeoffs. | From a RevOps perspective, with the increasing focus on automation, metrics, and AI in Sales, how are you measuring your team's effectiveness? Likewise, what have you found makes you the most efficient/effective at what you do? Non-technology answers would be great.

AI models can analyze historical data to prioritize leads that are more likely to convert.

The core insight?KV Cache hits are the only metric that really matters when building performant agents. Every decision you make around the model context, what to include, how to format, when to truncate, should optimize for KV Cache reuse. When KV Cache hits drop, your time-to-first-token (TTFT) skyrockets, slowing down your agent‚Äôs response. Plus, cached input tokens in frontier models are about 10x cheaper, so missing cache means you‚Äôre literally burning more money on every request. So, what‚Äôs the fix? \- Keep your prompt prefix stable and predictable and avoid injecting dynamic values like timestamps upfront. \- Serialize your context consistently by loading actions and observations in a predictable, repeatable order. This lets the KV Cache do its job, maximizing reuse and keeping your agent fast and cost-efficient. When it comes to tool calls, the common approach is to add or remove them dynamically mid-loop. But, that actually kills KV Cache efficiency. Instead, Manus recommends keeping tool calls fixed in the prompt and masking logits selectively to control when tools are used. This approach preserves the cache structure while allowing flexible tool usage, boosting speed and lowering costs. Context bloat is a classic agent challenge. As conversations grow, you typically truncate or summarize older messages, losing important details. Manus suggests a better way: offload old context to a file system (or external memory) instead of chopping it off, letting the model read in relevant info only when needed. And finally to keep the agent on track, have it periodically recite its objective. A self-check that helps it stay focused and follow the intended trajectory. Context engineering is still an evolving science, but from my experience, the best way to master it is by getting hands on and going closer to the metal.

A respected elder, the retired adventurer Daran Edermath, has put out a call for aid. Goblins, driven from the mountains by an unknown terror, have infested the sacred tomb of a local hero, Sir Odel. A plea has been posted for honourable adventurers to clear out the desecrators and ensure the knight's final rest remains undisturbed. A classic D&amp;D adventure awaits: can you be the heroes Phandalin needs?* --- ### About This One-Shot This will be a self-contained, 3-4 hour one-shot adventure designed for Level 1 characters. **Tone &amp; Gameplay:** This is a heroic one-shot focused on teamwork and clever thinking within a classic D&amp;D dungeon. The adventure culminates in a meaningful choice that will test your party's honour. It's a great opportunity for us to roll some dice, have a fun evening, and see if our playstyles are a good match. ### The Potential Campaign For those interested, this one-shot will also serve as a **""pilot episode""** for a longer-term sandbox campaign. Players who are a great fit for the table will be invited to continue into a full campaign set in the region. The long-term game would expand on the themes of exploration, rebuilding civilisation, and facing down a growing darkness that threatens the entire Sword Coast. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the campaign: **A Familiar But Different Faer√ªn:** We will be using the iconic maps and locations of the Sword Coast, but the deep history of this world is unique to our game. **For Newcomers:** You don't need to know any lore! We'll discover the world's secrets together. **For Veterans:** Think of your lore knowledge as ""lost legends."" This is a chance to explore a familiar land with fresh eyes, where the truth of the past is a central mystery. **Advancement:** We will use a *Session-Based Checkpoint* system. For every session you attend, you earn one advancement checkpoint.

They require username / pw as a service account for Snowflake, which Snowflake no longer supports. You can plug in a PAT, but then you are manually rotating a PAT. Also, if your Salesforce org has a field removed or restricted to your service account user via role based security, your AppFlow pipeline breaks, requiring admin intervention. Now, my recommendation is from being a ware that a potential solution exists to a formal recommendation not to use it. You shouldn't have to tinker with your production data pipelines.

But I couldn't help wondering if all the commenters saying that their homemade is much better or at least as good were right. So I decided to do a little experiment. I've been making my own vanilla extract for years (according to some it isn't actually extract but vanilla-infused vodka) by taking 7 vanilla beans and putting them in a bottle with about 1c of vodka and leaving it for at least 6 weeks. So I had some of that available. I bought a bottle of good store-bought pure vanilla extract. I decided to try something different. I put 6 vanilla beans and some 90-proof bourbon in an 8oz mason jar. I put 6 vanilla beans and some vodka in an 8oz mason jar. I put them in my sous vide setup and cooked them at 130F for 3 hours, then 120F for 3 hours, then 100F for 3 hours. This was to mimic what Stella described as the technique of commercial vanilla extract makers. I did that about 18 days ago and left the pods in the jar.

Is it worth 12.5 k INR ?,"I‚Äôve been using the Logitech ERGO M575S for almost a year now. Before that, I used the Logitech M235 Wireless Mouse for many years. As a woman with differentt size of hands compared to man , here‚Äôs my experience: M235: Fits my palm perfectly. I can use it for long hours without pain, but it‚Äôs not ergonomic, after extended use, I sometimes feel wrist strain. M575S: The ergonomic architecture is wonderful for reducing wrist strain, but the size is too large for my hands. When I use it for long hours, I start feeling pain in the palm bones due to the stretch required to grip and control it. The problem: Most ergonomic mice (especially trackball models) seem designed for larger hands. For people with smaller palms : women, teenagers, or simply those with petite hand sizes, this can mean that even the most ergonomic design ends up causing discomfort. My suggestion: Please consider creating a compact ergonomic trackball mouse, similar to the M575S, but scaled to fit smaller hands. That way, we can have both wrist comfort and a pain-free grip. I truly appreciate Logitech‚Äôs attention to user comfort and innovation, and I believe a smaller ergonomic option would be welcomed by many users like me.

We are mostly a beach sitting family (3 boys ages 3/6/9) - so we do a lot of playing and swimming. I‚Äôm looking for a couple of restaurants and activities that might be hits among our crew. Any restaurant that allows us to ‚Äúcatch our breath‚Äù a little bit, meaning it‚Äôs okay if the kids are a little loud or there are things to entertain the kids with. I remember going to The Big Chill, and it was a little crowded (spring break), but otherwise it was great. As far as activities go, I‚Äôm not sure where to start. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be pretty warm so anything that involves water would be great! Thanks in advance! | Two of my boys started playing baseball last summer and I ended up splurging on this beauty last fall (thank you Facebook marketplace guy if you see this).

DM me. | After having my i7 for nearly 2 years, I decided to change the roller brushes (I know way overdue). I ordered a pair from the iRobot store (purchasing the ones that said they were compatible with my model). However, when they arrived it was a very snug fit. When my iRobot ran it would stop every 1-2 mins and say the brushes were stuck. At this point, I noticed after measuring that the new rollers were ever so slightly bigger than my previous roller brushes that had come with my i7. So, I reached out for support. After waiting 1.5 weeks for a response (the email said their SLA was 2 days), support informed me that the brush design has changed and is no longer compatible with the legacy i7s. They first offered to send me a single pair of older roller brushes for free if they could find them in the warehouse. While this was a nice gesture, this does not solve the problem long term, because the same issue is going to arise the next time I need to replace the roller brushes. After pushing back, they understood and said they would be willing to offer me a 20% discount on a new cleaning unit that would work with new rollers after I purchased it at full price and offered receipt proof. I am baffled. I spent hundreds of dollars on a vacuum from iRobot, for the design to be changed just 2 years later to the point where I can no longer use replacement roller brushes without first paying for a new cleaning head unit (I guess it would at least be discounted). I would think the reasonable solution would be to either: 1. Sell the legacy brush rollers for previously manufactured i7s in addition to the new brushes for newer manufactured i7s for the duration of the typical product lifecycle (have a phase-out period) 2.

Issue: You will fail at scanning your QR code going through the gates unless you scan the QR code on the phone HORIZONTALLY!!! Why: In a vertical orientation, the scanner picks up RFID/IC card radio signals at the same time it attempts the QR code scan. If it senses the radio, signal it fails. Solution: Since the radio antenna on your phone is near the top of the phone, rotating your phone 90deg left, face down, to horizontal, will do the trick: the QR code is still visible to the window but the radio antenna is off the the left, NOT over the sensor.

But it is essential to avoid duplicating effort, reinventing the wheel, and essential to share knowledge and best practices across as large a team as possible. Also, it is not just about admins, but business sponsors and product owners. They need to know what processes and data each other have in the org and connect those when possible. The worst thing is to have each division siloed, but making changes to the same org. Imagine 3 teams remodeling a house, and two of them want to build a kitchen without collaborating.

Use intent classification only where needed, batch test aggressively, and set up monitoring on agent logs to catch anything weird early. I‚Äôd also recommend digging into your current escalations - which topics are still routed to agents? That gives you a focused roadmap for what to automate first with Agentforce. Prioritize the low-risk, high-volume use cases first. It can deliver strong results, but only if you approach it like a proper product - not a quick plugin. As with most projects, the discovery and solution design phases are where success or failure is decided. Skipping that groundwork is what usually makes Agentforce underdeliver. | Agentforce gets a lot of criticism, but its value really comes down to two things: how creative you are in designing meaningful use cases, and whether you have the right architect to make it real. | Don‚Äôt disappear for a month to build everything.

At its core, it is effectively masking your fragmented data issues by offering a translation layer that involves a ruleset which is as loose or as tight as you want it to be.

It is about getting a ruleset that gets the matching just right, so you don't resolve unexpected parties into an individual.

I joined because my previous company was being acquired by KKR(so it was going to be very bad for workers) and the new one was into new acquisition and needed rationalization on their IS. Result: I spend 1 week there, so far it is the worst project I've seen in my life I think. And it comes down to management for most part.

And it is really a full package, those 3 games were planned to unfold a complex story, FF XIII and XIII-2 are very good games and for the 3rd one, I think that they dramatically cut their losses and did on the very rare business stackholder operations at SE, around that time they FAFO'd with FF XIV as well, for Lightning Returns my theory is that they took only interns and did it at a 1/4 budget, everything is terrible and has really regressive quality from gameplays to menus, to chara design/music/loop, it's a true garbage tier game served as a final fantasy which destroyed a magnificent Triptych. FF XIII was very linear but it was setting up a world, and FF XIII-2 got pretty much acclaimed, if the 3rd one was just as good as the 2nd and ended the story properly, people would still be fan all the way.

Here‚Äôs what I did: 1. **Identified key areas** I wanted to focus on‚ÄîApex, LWC, Flows, Security, Data Modeling, etc. 2. **Uploaded a few blog articles or docs** on each topic and asked ChatGPT to quiz me on them. 3. For each question, I tried to answer it myself, then asked ChatGPT to explain the correct answer and the reasoning behind it. 4. I repeated this across topics, and it helped me retain concepts better and spot my weak areas. 5. I also used it to generate small code snippets or scenarios to practice hands-on.

We recently made an offer for a 2bed flat in London (Norwood junction) at 375k. And at the time we thought it was an ok price(maybe a tad overpriced compared to some other similar flats in the area). Today we received homebuyer survey and they valued the property at 300k. They also found a few things that I'm not feeling great about: - water tank in the attic, first time I see this in london - is it normal? Should I be worried? - hairline crack on the wall(didn't notice due to bricks when viewing the property) - high flood risk area, the flat is on 1st floor. I didn't really mind the price, as I was kind of hoping it will at least retain value. But seeing such low valuation is kinda scary. | Hello, I'm planning to get myself a mini pc and I mostly play world of tanks.

We initially viewed a ""showrrom flat"" in a block of falts, and reserved a plot Mid January(it's the same floorplan, just different floor) and got our mortgage approved subject to valuation beginnning of March. After that it took a whole month to get the valuation booked in, because sales agent was just unreachable and in the end it was arranged by me calling everyone and practically having a conference call. We were also trying to arrange a viewing during that time and 1 time couldn't get access to the plot we reserved because they misplaced keys. They had to replace locks after that, or so they said We just had our viewing after month of of trying and were appaled by the state of the apartment, there was a small crack on the wall next to the entrance door, apartment reeked of stale wa ‚Ä¶","So, If you have a robotic body, then you either don't feel anything or you feel artificial feelings (if touched then send X signal).

They even have a new update out that brings us the famed Iwo Jima map. | After rewatching that first Battlefield 6 reveal trailer, I can say it outright: it was a lie. | I have been on Ting (3 lines/smartphones) for as long as I can remember. We are in need of phone upgrades and it seems like Ting has basically given up their mobile operation so doesn't make sense to stay on them and hoping to get some deals on new smartphones (likely stick with Google Pixels and go to the 9/9a). US Mobile seems to get mixed reviews but the prices, unless I am missing something, look really good for the plans. I am not opposed to paying for annual as I don't plan to change. We also use Google Voice so our main #s would stay with voice and I'd port the underlying mobile numbers from Ting to US Mobile. Any opinions here or compelling arguments for other choices than US Mobile?

It's cool to get an unannounced content drop but this was small potatoes. If an event like this rotated every few days that's a different story.

I've lost more thopters to bugs than players. | Playing myself for the first time after buying it this week. So far so good and have a goal to get to the ship building | This. It kills immersion in that game. Land. Loading screen. Walk to building. Loading screen. Go to second room. Loading screen.

If you are playing a commander that isn't central to the deck going off then it's not really a Brawl/commander deck IMHO. Yes, I understand lots of folks playing casually but just seems like an odd format to play casually in to not have synergy with the marquee card. | Blocking is a greatly under utilized skill and too many players assume if they aren't using a shield they shouldn't block.

This doesn't always calculate the nuance of a situation, especially when it comes to FIRE. Here's an example where a couple is clearly saving a lot for retirement. However, their expenses are high and therefor the amount of money needed in a non-retirement account before they reach retirement age would need to be huge. However, maybe thats just the answer. Anyone wanting to FIRE needs to have a non-retirement account where 4% covers expenses. It just seems wild to me that someone can be barista FIRE or coast FIRE and would still need to double their net-worth to retire early. \--- **Retirement** * Retirement 1 (401k): $500k * Retirement 2a (403b): $150k * Retirement 2b (Pension): $150k u/60 * (Compound interest u/20 years x 5-7%): $1.7-$2.5M + Annual pension $80k **Investments** * Company Stock: $75k * Checking/Savings: $35k * Investment Account: ??? * This is where I'd like input from the community.

Two reasons I've heard frequently in San Diego is that only luxury condos are built, which doesn't reduce prices or rent for affordable housing. Another reason I hear is that there is so much latent demand for housing in San Diego, it can't be solved supply. This article seems to be a counterpoint against both of those arguments. Even luxury condos downtown are showing to have an impact on overall rental prices around them. Th ‚Ä¶","In San Diego, we have SANDAG- The San Diego Association of Governments. A few years ago we had a visionary leader who wanted to do some radical stuff across the county. It was pretty exciting. He couldn‚Äôt get the funding he needed to execute the plan and left. The issue we have is that the in City of San Diego is interested in more density and public transportation, but outlying communities are generally opposed and want more money spent on freeways. That follows the normal rural/urban divide that‚Äôs seen in other areas of the county. There are also wealthier coastal communities that are left-leaning, but also don‚Äôt want public transportation in their communities. The example right now is in Del Mar. They want public funding to protect expensive homes in vulnerable areas from sea level rise. They are simultaneously blocking any plan SANDAG proposes to protect a train that is facing the same issues and runs through their neighborhood. | We just did a home renovation in Southern California. They finish they did is smooth with small imperfections. Someone I know said it‚Äôs actually called smooth imperfect and is the go-to finish for most contractors in the state.

Armed a mindflayer ship to go into the hells to retrieve the artifact, the one object that could defeat the brain. Invents a false God. All to have total control and domination over BG3 and beyond. 10/10 **Pseudo-profound bullshit**: Used PPB to dress up his desire for power with an apparent desire to serve and protect. 8/10 **Conspiracy mongering**: Again, both invents the conspiracy and makes it real. 9/10 **Profiteering**: But of course! 10/10 \-----&gt; Overall, Gortash fits the bill of a guru.

The best I can come up with: **Agreeable** \- Most Narcs are disagreeable. They often seem to enjoy conflict, unless they have something to gain from the person who they view as a social superior. **Neuroticism -** Covert narcs tend to be higher in neuroticism; overt narcs might be a little neurotic, but they can't show or admit it. **Introversion/Extroversion** \- Again, Covert Narcs are often introverted while the classic grandiose ty ‚Ä¶","Comorbid with NPD. | it's just. pretentious way of saying ""if you know who you are, you don't need to defend yourself.""

Makes sense, especially considering we‚Äôre chasing Rodgers. But now that‚Äôs out the window.

If this is your plan, how do you not make a more concerted effort to bring in GP‚Äôs replacement or make this trade during the draft. And on top of this, Rodgers isn‚Äôt even on the roster yet and could never be. I understand not wanting to pay big money for a player who‚Äôs a headache, but from an X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs standpoint I do not see the point of trading away last years best weapon, leaving Smith with a worse offense, likely to save money to pay TJ 45 million a year.

Our paladin wanted to offer the traumatic memory of his family being murdered when he was younger, which is what set him on his path, the Oath of Vengeance. The transaction completed... I messaged the player earlier today to discuss the consequences of this decision. I asked, outside of character development what do you think would be fair to change mechanically game-wise for your paladin, because you literally have nothing to avenge. He said, nothing should change, because he didn't change his oath, still went through all the paladin training and went on a rampage for the last 10-12 years killing baddies. Do you think this line of thinking is justified or should there be a serious consequence? Just want to say, thank you fellow DM's I love this subreddit and the many interesting posts and responses these past two years. Edit: Thank you everyone for the amazing responses. After reading all the comments I'm in agreement abilities should not be nerfed.

I have been dealing with back (and some related neck) pain for more than a decade now. It started with poor sitting postures, but I have worked on 1. Changing my posture to work standing (I can stand now for easily 8+ hours and work) 2. Consistent yoga, stretching and doing (small) weights and cardio Even after all of that, I still wake up with pain and frozen body. Every morning, I have to stretch and do it all over again. Anytime I sit, the pain starts building up. My MRI results are below. My physiatrist recommended physical therapy, which I have done many times. Is surgery the option? Everywhere I read, people are saying surgery is the last resort. I can get an assessment from a surgeon, but wanted to learn from the forum's experience first. &gt;Impression &gt;IMPRESSION: &gt;Right paracentral annular tear and disc protrusion at L5-S1 with stenosis of the right lateral recess and compression of the proximal right S1 nerve root. &gt;Narrative &gt;MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST &gt;HISTORY: 43 year-old Male, c/o right sided LE symptoms, and central lower lumbar pain x 10 years, recent flare up.

I learned that some stretches help relax the muscles and strengthen the muscles (as well) around areas where you have developed problems. I do regenerative yoga poses like Balasana (or Child's pose) with deep breathing, which is quite relaxing. On the other hand, I also do Malasana (or Squat), which is not an easy one to do if you have injuries and can cause pain. Clearly, if a stretch is causing you more pain or you are having trouble with balancing, then you have to be careful. There's also a difference between flexion and extension. You can experiment and see which one is causing you pain and making things worse vs helping. | It's most likely tight lower back and hip muscles.

Corporate understood what no support rep could - that the issue couldn't be both customer equipment and a splitter problem; it had to be one or the other. The technician fee was not valid - just as I was saying all along. Additionally, it seems that support reps don't have the authority to remove the fee (even if you escalate it), so if you have a valid case, escalating through official complaints is the way to go (rather than within Comcast). If you do not have a valid case, do not escalate it - it's a waste of these resources. \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ETA: Adding this to inform others who are in a similar boat. After talking with support via Modmail, nothing can be done to remove the fee because it's a ""valid fee"". They told me: &gt;The reason you were charged for the visit is that the tech indicated there were ""customer equipment problems"". The replaced splitter is also noted as a resolution, but the visit chargeable because of that initial reason I mentioned. In case you didn't know, the splitter is comcast-owned infrastructure, not a customer's responsibility. The splitter is noted by the technician as the resolution for my intermittent connection issues. Even though they can validate what I said about the splitter being the root issue, they cannot apply more than the $50 credit because the fee is ""valid"" since there is a note about ""customer equipment problems"". Well yeah, my equipment isn't going to work if there's a faulty splitter. The root cause was the splitter and anyone can see that is obvious, but an erroneous note about ""customer equipment problems"" is why I'm forced to pay a fee that I didn't consent to and wasn't made aware of even though that information is so obviously false. This is an example of predatory and deceptive billing practices.

I currently have more than 15 full in my refrigerator alone. Before you ask, my doctor prescribes what she thinks is right plus 20% so what has been happening is I am nailing my A1C goals and numbers and I just have a lot of extra insulin. This is a good problem to have but now I am running into a problem of too much left over and I would like to help out others in need. (Please no DMs just asking me for insulin by the way. I am trying to donate the insulin the right way within laws and regulations in the US). So I was looking into donating the extra vials to help others in need, and this doesn't seem easy in some areas, but I found one organization. **Insulin For Life USA.** [https://iflusa.org/](https://iflusa.org/) Has anyone donated to them or used their services? They have a pretty good rating (above 70% almost everywhere) and I think they are legit and trustworthy.

But holy cow the consulting partners for SFDC vary way to much and are just doing a lot of vibe coding nowadays and I just keep cleaning up all of their implementations. | Disabled Dataloader? Heck no.. Have we accounted for the three people that need access and allow for just those three people? Heck yes. Everyone else gets an error. To be clear, the hackers aren't using the ""Data Loader Partner"" Connected App. They are using a Connected App that is pretty closely named Data Loader and then tricking / social engineering the people to click Allow. *These are not the same thing.* But seriously, API Access Control is a must as anyone in your entire Instance can install a Connected App and click Allow. That means data exfiltration is still possible. Salesforce should allow for a setting to make Connected Apps disabled by default.

newslettermaven,Real post bootcamp grad experience | PCC listed for sale on Loopnet,"Edit: TLDR - it‚Äôs taken me almost 4 years to get close to a developer job post bootcamp. I got a job doing something adjacent, based on a collective of experience, not just bootcamp. In my situation bootcamp was a fine experience, it was an aggressive learning environment (it‚Äôs literally called bootcamp), I don‚Äôt regret it. I am neither for or against bootcamp. I‚Äôm just someone who grabs the reigns even when they‚Äôre slightly out of reach. Also. Different job market. Original post: I graduated from a university coding bootcamp in 2020, program cost at the time was $12k. It‚Äôs now 4 years later and think it might be helpful to share my post bootcamp grad experience getting a job, and the roles I‚Äôve held these past few years. Towards the end of the program I updated my LinkedIn and added my projects and portfolio. I had been in sales for 6 years prior. Right after graduation I applied to multiple developer roles a day (I tailored my resume to every. single. job description) and after about 30 applications I decided to get my Salesforce Admin certification. I was a salesforce super user at my prior job and I had a lot of experience leveraging the system to improve outcomes in my sales and service processes which was great content for interviews and cover letters. I shifted to applying to Salesforce Admin roles and got a lot more responses and traction with that route. I landed a job roughly 3 months after graduation as an sf admin at a tiny company, $87k fully remote. I was promoted once and went through 2 review cycles at that company and when I left I was at $108k. I am now at a huge enterprise and I have the opportunity to work on Salesforce Developer tasks. I‚Äôve started conversations to move into development and think I‚Äôll be able to move into that role in within the next year. The average salary for an sf dev at my company is $137k, still remote.

nopnam,Slow WiFi on Omada Setup,"**Issue** I recently went and completely redid my home internet setup with TP-Link Omada gear, pay for 1GB fiber up and down, but over WiFi never see more than 500Mbps. I had my ISP come out and with their wireless AP, I got OVER 1GB. On a wired connection, I'm able to get pretty close to the stated 1GB. I'm suspecting an issue with how the APs are configured. I've used the WiFi Optimization multiple times. **My Setup** I have an Omada Cloud Controller, SG2210MP POE switch, ER605 Router, 4 EAP615-Wall APs. My house has a basement, main floor, and an upstairs (about 4000 sqft). I have one EAP615 in the basement (hardwired), two on the main floor (both hardwired), and one upstairs (hardwired). Mesh is completely turned off. I'm using both 2.4GHz and 5GHz on all APs. The Channel Width seems to be auto set to 80MHz on all APs. The channels and Tx Power were auto set by the WiFi Optimizer--all seemed to be set to Tx Power of ""High"" and all on different channels.","Feel free to reach out.

I'm getting the standalone old ONT back, but I was getting low speeds with that too which is why they ""upgraded"" me to the new device. I just like the standalone ONT better since I don't need the router. | Thanks. When I get home I'm going to try and disable all other devices connected to one AP and see what happens.

I'd hate to see these tariffs fall into place, and that would be devastating for US imports of European wine. However, I think that with the right combination of talent, climate, and vineyard management, US producers *could* be able to produce some of the best red blends in the world‚Äîcomparable to many top producers, if not go toe-to-toe with first growth. I recognize there are major differences in terroir, tradition, and climate, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre *categorically impossible* to overcome. I‚Äôd argue most of those elements can be overcome or reimagined through thoughtful winemaking. That said, here are a few areas where I know skeptics might push back‚Äîand I‚Äôm open to being convinced: # 1. U.S. Terroir Is Different, Not Inferior Yes, Bordeaux and Loire sit on ancient soils with millions of years of mineral layering and perfect water-retention profiles. But U.S. regions like Napa, Walla Walla, or even Paso Robles have their own distinct terroir‚Äîsometimes younger or more volcanic, but still capable of producing deep, complex wines. I don't believe that terroir alone is a distinguishing factor and through careful cultivation and selection of growing regions, could be managed. # 2. Climate Can Be Managed The U.S. tends to run hotter in many key wine regions, but winemakers can (and do) manage brix, acid retention, canopy, and irrigation strategically and effectively. Bordeaux has more weather volatility year-to-year, so I'm not sure ""predictability"" is a huge advantage there either. # 3. Creative Freedom in the U.S. Is a Strength French AOC laws are rigid‚Äîyou can‚Äôt innovate as easily or take risks on blends. The U.S., by contrast, allows winemakers to experiment and refine, which I see as an edge. The University of Minnesota for example is focused on creating cold-hardy wines, but other state u ‚Ä¶","I never noticed the rain drops before today | Hi! I contribute to Salesforce certifications.

What if someone is already sitting there? üòú Me, waiting for my train and also preparing how I'll deny when someone asks to exchange seats. I've had so many such instances that I just know it's going to happen today as well. Lol. | So i order alot from blinkit and Zepto. Today I just checked and wanted to remove the donation which is by default added (just trying i always donate) and surprisingly it won't let me do that ?? I mean it should be my choice to decide whether to donate or not. Is it really normal ?? Am i missing something. | So for me, this is like the 3rd or 4th instance today in metro where I gave up my seat for someone, and when their station came, they didn‚Äôt offer me my seat back but simply left. I saw a woman with two small kids boarding, and I felt she should sit with her kids, so I gave up my seat. About 15 to 16 stations later, when her stop arrived, I was standing right in front of her since my luggage was under the seat. She simply got up, and the person next to me took the seat. If she had wanted to, she could have offered the seat back to me, i didn't realise when she got up and the other person took the seat. I just wanted to know if you have ever faced something similar and how you feel about it. Sometimes, I wonder if I shouldn‚Äôt have given up my seat. I know she might have forgotten or had other reasons, but still, if someone gave me their seat and my stop was approaching, I would make sure to ask them to sit again as a token of respect. | So, I think I am getting better at it now, and I feel more confident while saying no when someone asks me to exchange my seat. A few years back, I used to simply give away my seat, thinking I could adjust. But from last year onwards, I decided not to give it away (if the other person is not actually in need). I boarded my train, and as usual, a family was sittin ‚Ä¶","Dhruv rathi ki PR team se ho aap ?? Perplexity can burn money on premium modal because it's investors money .

For others interested: I used the Home Depot website to check stores near me and found a couple in-state that had it marked with a clearance badge and 'in-store pickup only'. Definitely call ahead to confirm pricing - my store had them marked as $780 but they rang up as $650. There seems to be some still available depending on your location. YMMV! | I'm not a lawyer, but I've been learning more about Citizens United and it seems to reveal some real contradictions I'd love help understanding. The Court explicitly states that restricting money 'necessarily reduces' political expression and that spending is required for effective political speech. But this creates a weird situation: - Rich person: 'Not being able to spend my millions is silencing my speech!' - Court: 'Yes, that's unconstitutional suppression of speech.' But then: - Average citizen: 'Not being able to spend millions (because I don't have them) is silencing my speech!' - Court: 'No, that's just... how things are.' Here's what seems like a problem to me - while regular economic inequality might be private, isn't the government actively creating and protecting unequal speech rights by: 1. Courts actively protecting unlimited spending through their power 2. Government enfo ‚Ä¶","I have both. Deck is probably my favorite device of all time.

I honestly wondered how much of these comments and post are AI based on the over the top obsession with an incremental upgrade and some meh games so far. | I think you are mistaken, there are several post and discussions about it. 30fps doesn‚Äôt bother me at all.

[MSTR](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PmorRTbk/) is essentially a leveraged (between 1.25-1.75x) Derivative of BTC. BTC is already one of the most volatile assets in history - investing your money in MSTR Spot Equities will expose you to MORE volatility than Bitcoin. 1. MSTR WILL outperform BTC, but can swing wildly up and down outside of the hourly/daily price action of BTC. It is not tied directly to BTC performance on any small time frames. 2. Over longer time periods, MSTR will trend along with BTC in a positive correlation. 2. [MSTY](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oohpUlvVjKVn4fN-MBly4YNAUopvjd6VrQCDrL2Jp1s/edit?gid=0#gid=0) is never going to outperform MSTR, even when you reinvest the dividends into MSTR. Thats without even considering the comlicated tax mess that you end up in with the random % of distributions being applied to RoC vs Income. 1. This is a pure Fee Trap hiding as a smart income play. 3. [MSTU](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C2FPaCodjwo0sWOhqECcZar5TCk6fuaZywOo-egPaUs/edit?gid=0#gid=0) has EXTREME potential to fuck your day up. But during a BULL RUN it can absolutely fly away from anything else. 1. If you dont understand how DAILY 2x performance etfs work, you will absolutely get drawn down to pennies by 2026 if you hold this too long. 2. If you have to ask why, you shouldn't put your money anywhere near this. 3. I am personally 100% in MSTU because I FULLY understand and accept the potential to go to zero tomorrow. 4. [MSTX](https://www.etf.com/MSTX#:~:text=Expense%20Ratio-,1.29%25,-AUM) is the exact same thing as [MSTU](https://www.etf.com/MSTU#:~:text=Expense%20Ratio-,1.05%25,-AUM) 1.

If on top of that you have a complex solution, you may go even less far. On the flip side, a more user-friendly and possibly more limited solution unleashes more creativity, I personally believe less is more. Key is the data you can use for such personalization, indeed, and I agree Salesforce data is great to use, combined with behavioral intent signals. Great agencies can make you very successful with a powerful solution, though resources will go into that. What's key with personalization, as opposed to building a website, the maintenance part is even more important. So be wary of going for a complex, powerful v1 of a personalization setup, because keeping it up to date is tough. The other problem is that agencies, especially bad agencies, are biased: they make more money if you go for something complex, so look for agencies that will clearly talk about pros and cons. Think of personalization as campaigns that you want to run in an agile and frequent way, they don't have to be complex. This guide shows some [**great campaign ideas**](https://support.saleswingsapp.com/en/articles/11798690-saleswings-interactions-campaigns-inspiration-guide). | The crux is in the tuning and data. If you don't have access to good data, and that means data that comes with context that explains it, it's a lot harder to make it work.

Any recommendations on aftermarket speakers/subwoofers? | Hi all, We just bought a 2024 Volvo XC90 B6, and I wanted to give my feedback. Details: - Single previous owner - 16,000 miles - Certified Pre-Owned - Middle trim package The good: - Really pretty car. We got dark blue exterior with blonde interior, and it looks gorgeous. - Feels luxurious - Good acceleration - I like the active lane assist - It‚Äôs a tank. Definitely feels safe, and the backup auto-brake stopped my wife from backing into a trash can. The bad: - The technology is extremely finicky. About 25% of the time I try to play music through Bluetooth, the car says music is playing and my iPhone does too‚Ä¶ except nothing comes out. Cancel everything/ turn it off - still music will not play until turning car off and on. - Twice in the last row weeks, our UI/dashboard just doesn‚Äôt work. No sounds from the car, either. Even turning the car off and on doesn‚Äôt fix it. So far, only waiting overnight has fixed it. - The trunk foot opener seems to only work about 10% of the time. It‚Äôs faster to just drop what I‚Äôm carrying, use the normal trunk opener, and pick it back up. - Start/stop is jerky. Every time I come to a stop for more than 10 seconds or so, the next time I accelerate is extremely jerky. We leap forward; I‚Äôm guessing this is due to the gas/electric engine deal it‚Äôs got going on - Safety features can be annoying. I took it through an automatic car wash, put it in neutral just like you normally do in those, and the car absolutely flipped out, started auto braking and blinking red like it detected an incoming missile. Overall: 6/10 This car is very pretty, but also extremely finicky. The tech has me very frustrated. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just a learning curve, but a lot of it goes beyond that.

After reviewing several customers' security posture, we found people were only blocking and reviewing third-party connected apps / blocking them, etc and thinking they were safe. Then totally ignoring the salesforce data loader connected app. PLEASE if you haven't already read the following to make sure your or your clients orgs are safe: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/francisuk_please-do-this-to-keep-your-salesforce-org-activity-7360981355767193600-wnZd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAANagsBY4hlicqVLEC7Zw3Kj3-Vunymf3E | I think this post is coming from my interest in wanting to understand what people really think of AI, where they think it's going and how/if they changed their plans because of AI. Firstly, I have completed several AI projects specifically around Salesforce (not just Agentforce), as well as creating smaller AI models in AWS and have been around SF and AWS 18+ years (went to the first AWS Reinvent etc) But I have the feeling that people have their heads in the sand. I'm working with companies, and I continually think, ""This company isn't going to exist in 5 years, maybe less. All it will take is for that particular industry to realise they can do X and customers to see the value and pop"" (and that's just using simple AI use cases). I‚Äôm convinced that in three to five years, customers, patients, buyers, citizens will expect every serious provider to wield AI. They‚Äôll choose the doctor who uses AI decision-support over the one who ‚Äúgoes by gut.‚Äù They‚Äôll pick the insurer whose chatbot resolves a claim in minutes over the one who still pushes paper, it's going to turn into a tidal wave of change.

Is it because the support teams are getting more out of agentforce? | But it's not the data loader that's the attack surface, it's the data loader's default client_id. Ok, suppose you enable API access control so that the API is only accessible for connected apps, and you give all your users access to the Data Loader connected app. So, how does this prevent a malicious app from using the same client ID as the Data Loader? If one of your unsuspecting users falls for a social engineering attack (now easily identifiable as anyone with ""Salesforce Admin"" in their job title on LinkedIn), it won't provide any protection, right? The only safeguard you might have is if you restrict the connected app by IP address. Or change the client_id? As this also blocks the attack on the same IP. But API access control is really useless for this attack. Right? Or am I missing something obvious? I'm totally happy to admit my mistake, it's just that at the moment no one has countered this with an alternative solution? | Think you missed the point. The client_id is the weakness not data loader. IE anyone can create a web app using the same client_id and those three users if they access the malicious app will gift access to your org to the hacker, setting data loader connected app restricted by IP will help if you do restrict your IPs but TBH its cleaner if you just disable the data loader connected apps create your own using your own unique client_id. Data Loader still works perfectly well, it's just using a different client_id | So, it is within the Chrome app itself. The developer states that these are the domains on which this app will operate.

Ich br√§uchte mal Rat von der Schwarmintelligenz welche sich hier tummelt, ich hoffe ein wenig mehr Perspektive zu bekommen. Kurz zu mir, ich bin fast 40 (gott tut das weh sowas zu schreiben) Ausbildung und BA Studium hinter mir und das Gl√ºck gehabt vor vielen Jahren in die IT Welt eingestiegen zu sein. Ich arbeite seit √ºber 10 Jahren als Software Berater. Ich habe zuerst klassisch selber implementiert, global und regionale Projekte und seit 4 Jahren leite ich bei der Firma (In den 10 Jahren waren es insgesamt drei Firmen) ein kleines Presales Team, welches aber zum Jahresende wahrscheinlich aufgel√∂st wird. Bin ich ehrlich gesagt auch happy dar√ºber, ich fand es zwar cool, aber wenn man im Mittelstand Manager ist, hat man eher Druck von oben und man kann wenig bis gar nichts selber entscheiden, fand ich nicht so geil, ergo bin ich nicht so traurig dar√ºber. Ich habe nebenher noch einen kleinen Onlineshop laufen, welcher ehrlicherweise so lala l√§uft, liegt aber glaube ich auch etwas an der Zeit welche ich daf√ºr aufwenden kann. Ich versuch jedoch weiterhin das Ding ein wenig zum Laufen zu bringen. Meine Frage zielt jetzt ein bisschen in die Zukunft. Seit jeher arbeite ich mit einer CRM Technologie und ich glaube ich w√§re offen f√ºr was neues. Schade um das konkrete Technologie Wissen, dies kann man aber zu teilen sich auch auf andere umm√ºnzen. Also was kann ich? 6 Jahren Projekt Erfahrung als Berater bis hin zum Senior. 4 Jahre Manager Position und auch aktiv im PreSales gewesen, also technischer Verkauf. Ich habe aber gemerkt, dass ich keine Lust auf den technischen Aspekt habe, ich bin ein Peoples person und kann gut mit anderen Menschen, daher ist denke ich der Verkauf eine sinnvolle Richtung. Ich bin bisschen aufgeschmissen, weil ich nicht weiss was ich sonst machen ‚Äúk√∂nnte‚Äù. Ich m√∂chte auf jeden Fall im Tech Bereich bleiben weil ich daf√ºr brenne. Hier geht es weniger um Geld, sonder eher um Blicke und Meinungen von Erfahrenen Leute in h√∂heren P ‚Ä¶","Ah verstehe! Nee Umzug steht ausser Frage. Das Ding ist zwecks Weiterentwicklung - Ich glaube das w√§re dann wieder ein technischer Schritt - oder was genau meinst du? Hm ja, aber Agentur Arbeit heisst auch gerne mal extra √úberstunden.

Und nat√ºrlich gucken dass alle happy sind. Und die zweite S√§ule ist im Endeffekte die selbe Arbeit wie die machen. Also ich bin nicht die F√ºhrungskraft sondern habe am Ende den selbe technischen Struggle den die haben und kann mitreden. Ich mache sonst alles was im PreSales anf√§llt. Ausschreibungen, technisches Pendant zum kommerziellen Vertriebler und beantworten die ersten Fragen. Baue und pr√§sentiere Demos und pr√§sentiere auch vor Ort. Ab und zu kommen noch Webinar und Verbandsarbeit dazu. Nach M√∂glichkeit versuche ich auch inter Prozesse voranzutreiben.

The original asking price started off at $950k and has inched up over time to now $2M. Does anyone know what is going on or has a theory? Genuinely curious as I've been hoping for action on a Pier Park expansion for years now. I would assume that the city wants to purchase these lots as they are one of the last remaining sections between Pier Park and Sapperton Landing that isn't publicly owned. In the big scheme of things a million or two isn't a huge amount of capital for the city given how strategic having a connected riverfront is over the longer term. Especially with the Pier Park fire insurance money. Why hasn't a deal hasn't been made yet? | It is official now. | Thumbnail: | I'm a DIYer taking on the renovation of a 3500sqft home. I've convinced myself that investing in a quality dust extractor is worth it for my family's health and for my marriage considering how much dust will be created while living in the house during renovations. I've used friend's Festool and have contractors who highly recommend them as well. My question is if the CT Midi I will work well enough for drywall sanding. It only has manual cleaning, not auto cleaning. Should I see this as a deal breaker and move up to the CT 36 AC? A bit of extra work to manually clean the filter isn't a huge deal to me as long as it isn't super frequent. Open to hearing any other advice as well. Thanks! | In general I enjoy Sonos for whole home audio but it doesn't integrate with my basement AV receiver (which natively supports AirPlay) or my kids HomePod Minis. I've also gone all-in on the Apple Home app and like how seamlessly both the AppleTV and HomePod Mini's integrate.

It felt more future proof if I was ever to add other vacuums for others floors of my house. | Ah, you're right. I'm used to my work where the fiscal quarters are offset by one month from the calendar year. My bad. | Who is going to report this and who is to say what an ""election sign"" is or is not? Obviously the sign is from the past election, but is it an ""election sign""? We are not within the sensitive pre-campaign window that starts a few months before the election and this is used in conjunction with a political event. You might be technically right (or perhaps not, neither of us are lawyers) but I don't see a harm or a need to crack down on something benign as this. | \^ Very likely this.

You can learn more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayeshg/). I'm Sanjna Parulekar, SVP Product Marketing here at Salesforce.

We had a blast! | &amp;#x200B; We‚Äôre members of the team responsible for building [trusted AI](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/trusted-ai) at Salesforce. That means we deliver tools to our employees, customers, and partners for developing and using AI responsibly, accurately, and ethically. Ask us anything! We believe businesses and other organizations should develop and implement AI in a way that ensures [accuracy, safety, transparency, empowerment, and sustainability](https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/generative-ai-5-guidelines-for-responsible-development/). We can answer questions about: The actions organizations can take to prepare their businesses for AI, how to get high quality data, the characteristics of responsible AI, how to keep humans in the loop, identifying and mitigating biases, getting stakeholder feedback, and key ethical considerations around AI. Learn more about us:[Kathy Baxte ‚Ä¶","SP: There are several popular use cases for Agentforce, many of which are articulated here: [https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/use-cases/.](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/use-cases/) Agentforce is a platform- so you can use the out of the box capabilties for use cases in service and sales, or you can build any agent for any use case you can dream of where you see value for efficiencies. | SP: End users can experience benefits from Agentforce in a variety of ways. Whether it's faster resolution time (aka answer my question, now!), a smoother experience in finding information about a business, or completing an action like making a return. For our own implementation of Agentforce on [help.salesforce.com](http://help.salesforce.com/), you can see all of the metrics we are using to track success including how many cases Agentforce is handling, escalating to a human, and successfully deflecting. | SP: Agentforce is a powerful platform to build, manage, and deploy agents. AI Agents are a new type of software that can reason and take action autonomously. There are several applications of the technology you can explore on agentforce.com. | SP: The pricing model for Agentforce is designed to scale with the volume of questions you get for the agent. There are a variety of factors to consider in this as well- some customers opt for different experiences for authenticated and unauthenticated users, some customers prefer to branch some parts of their customer service ""decision tree"" and have agentforce only handle certain types of questions. It is very variable across customers. | JG: I'll take that compliment :-) | SP: One of the key advantages of Agentforce is that it is built on our deeply unified Salesforce Platform.

I know negotiations normally are fine but w this company they have so many applicants and strong contenders I get the sense that they can easily pass me up. | I have my panel presentation this week. Wondering if anyone who is currently in the role can describe the nature of the company and this department's morale since those big layoffs? My concerns would be about the work life balance and stability of the role. | I have failed this exam 3x now. I have used prompt builder, copilot. I practice. I build them for fun for various scenarios. I literally demoed these tools at two different conferences. I study the governor limits. I study at night. I did the trailheads, literally get 90s on the practice exams. I took the free exam prep course that was offered this week. I find the specific copilot questions to be worded rather confusingly. I also find a lot of the product names to be similar sounding and like who gives a shit if it‚Äôs Einstein Email Reply or Einstein Service Emails like who the fuck wrote this exam? I am guessing I should just relax and stop trying bc it‚Äôs causing me so much anxiety. For reference, I have 8 certs and nearly 20 yrs experience. I passed most of my architect certs on the first try. Like what the fuck is wrong w me? I feel so low right now, I hate this cert game. | Welp. I have a fast update for you. On Tuesday evening I was notified that my last day on the project would ‚Ä¶","I‚Äôm calling bullshit. You actually got a call to interview for a technical architect position without even having an admin cert? GTFO | I think you are correct with your assumption, and it‚Äôs a bummer, but I do think the offer was sincere. I once rocked an interview and was told the next day that I wouldn‚Äôt proceed because they were just overwhelmed w too many candidates already. Recruiter called me back a week later for another role. And yes they do move fast, which is refreshing when other companies drag it out. | Look up that course and familiarize yourself w the concepts. Do you have experience in them? | Yeah I think ultimately it will depend on what they‚Äôre using and how deeply. Creating a queue and basic use case for case management is easy. If you get into call center integrations and service consoles, etc, you‚Äôd be out of your league if they want someone w that experience. I also know a lot of people have no clue how to hire talent. I‚Äôve seen many JDs demanding certain certs that were absolutely not needed. | lol I completely misunderstood or misread that. I‚Äôve seen so many folks saying ‚Äúthis one is so easy, you can def pass that other one!‚Äù that I thought it was more bullshit. Sorry for being so dull in my haste! | Just chiming in to say - SF was never meant to be a not out of box concept. If you want to custom code the look and feel of everything, you are paying way too much for SF as the customer. The trade off is that the platform OOB features do most of the work and you save $$ in not having to staff as much. This has always been the mission since early 2000s. That said, there‚Äôs plenty of use cases for custom dev and as a consultant I‚Äôve never run into an org that never needed custom dev for a solution. You dev for what can‚Äôt be done OOB which is plenty. You dev for integrations, calculations, etc etc. That said, your plan is solid and there‚Äôs no harm in widening your horizons and skillset. | I would ask more specifics.

Any redditors looking for some side work in our area?,"We have some specific accounts that we'd like to block from accessing Messaging for In App and Web in our Experience (using the standard component). Flexible on how we block - either hide it entirely or display a message before they see our custom pre-chat form so they don't waste time going through it to be turned away by an agent. It seems there really isn't much flexibility in this regard though - I'm curious how others are doing this? The component in the experience doesn't allow audiences, so that rules out the most straightforward approach. The pre-chat form seems to run inside the secondary experience that holds MFIAW, so whenever I use LWC or Apex to get any user details, it's getting the user details of the default user of that ESW messaging experience and not the actual end-user, so I can't easily figure out who they are programmatically. The JS function for passing pre-chat details doesn't seem to include hidden pre-chat fields, so even though I have email/ID's as hidden pre-chat fields pre-populated, I can't seem to figure out a way to read those in the actual pre-chat LWC either?

I'm making techno, industrial, and punk-infused electronic music, so I need a filter that can get super dirty and distorted. The 100 Grit seems perfect for that, as it's designed specifically for destruction and has that classic analog grit. It looks like a noise-making machine in its own right. However, the Bionic Lester is really pulling me in with its versatility. The stereo capabilities and all the routing options (series, parallel, dual mono) are amazing. Being able to morph between filter types is a huge plus, and I love the idea of creating more complex, evolving textures. I already have the Doepfer Wasp in my rack. Has anyone used both? What are your experiences? Which one would you recommend for making music that needs to sound raw and aggressive? Thanks for any insights! | Thumbnail: default | Our Company is migrating the Sales/Retail system from an old proprietary system to a new commercial product. We have a separate promotional platform that we are already using with the old system, and one of the responsibilities of the sales system is to award balance points to the customer when a sale is made. For this, the sales system makes an API call to the promotion platform, sending the sales transaction data, the promotion platform calculates the balance to be awarded, adds it to the customer‚Äôs balance, and responds to the sales system with the awarded amount so that the sales system can add it to the transaction and print it on the ticket. The problem that we have is the following: Sometimes the response from the promotional platform takes too much time, and the POS forces a timeout, not to block the sale and provide better customer experience. In this cases, the old system marked the transaction as ‚ÄòBalance not provided‚Äô and sent it to a queue at the sales system backend to retry the ‚ÄòAwar ‚Ä¶","almeriense eh | well I'm into really noisy stuff! the thing that turns me off about the 100grit is the lack of flexibility, I'm afraid it would be a one trick pony? | Really? would you say the BL is clean? that's not what I thought from the demos, particularly [this one](https://youtu.be/TUPXxAuZFUQ?si=8CYiDbecua8Vv2AK) Doesn't the overdrive make it a dirty beast? | [not impossible](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/s/1DXIBGnmLG) | someone explain to me why this is acceptable but pineapple on the pizza is barbarism | [Autechre actually shared their presets for the MM/MD](https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2018/11/13/autechre-shares-its-elektron-secrets/) | what about the comic sans font | what is the value difference between this and a regular chatbot? | again, a statement without a single mention of the word PALESTINE on it.

Because we are a native Salesforce app, we can pull in all NetSuite data and keep Salesforce up-to-date. Boomi and Celigo are great tools, but at the end of the day, they are both a general-purpose iPaaS, and getting the integration built properly is your responsibility. Breadwinner is a point-to-point native integration, and as such, can do a lot of things that Boomi and Celigo can't. We can: * Go live in a day for our NetSuite to Salesforce data replication * For Salesforce to NetSuite, that's usually another day using our wizard, or another week if pure API * Handle custom fields * Handle standard objects and custom objects * Ensure data accuracy within 5 minutes * Provide pre-built UI in Salesforce * Match NetSuite records to the corresponding Salesforce record * Have a weekly paranoid full-data overwrite, just because we obsess about data quality. I should add that we don't usually compete with Boomi or Celigo, because they connect to 100+ platforms, and all we do is connect Salesforce and NetSuite. As a result, we end up being run alongside Boomi or Celigo.

You can make the math work so that it‚Äôs a null or only slight increase in costs but will provide long term savings 2) you can extend your renewal term. If you are on a one year, consider a three year term and Salesforce may award you discounts. Remember, Salesforce recognizes revenue on future acv within the contract term. With this option they can recognize two more years of acv now. Sometimes reps are incentivized this. 3) wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, but you can threaten a non renewal and move to another platform if they do not concede on pricing. This may sour things with Salesforce and have long term impact. Just know, the likelihood of you reducing licensing and getting any discount is next to none. You have to make it mutual. Option one is usually the best. Buy something now, negotiate your overall licensing spend, find ways for cost savings down the road. Your focus should be on getting discounts on the big hitters (like enterprise licenses) since you know you will likely need more in the future and those have the highest costs.

I've uploaded my code here https://github.com/wolff1029/Lab-6-Destructor-Debugging/blob/main/testExTree.cpp. The vast majority of the logic in the link above is the template from the course professor, all I've implemented for the sake of trying to keep this targeted is the build() method which creates one root node with a left and right child node. I've also implemented the delete call within the destroy() method. My rational is as follows - 1. When the testExTree.cpp file is executed, the constructor for the myExpressionTree instance for t2 is called which sets root to NULL. 2. Later when the build() method is called on t2, the simple tree is constructed and I explicitly set root to point to the ""the root"" newNode variable. 3. When the end of the main method is reached, the destructor for t2 (~myExpressionTree()) would be called which then calls destroyTree() and then destroy(root). 4. Since we explicitly initialized newNode, rightNode, and leftNode in build() with the new keyword, I was expecting to have to delete these nodes to deallocate the memory from the heap. 5. When delete on the newNode is called, I was expecting the ~ExpressionNode destructor to run which would delete the left and right nodes. That said I am getting a Segmentation Fault when deleting root, so clearly I'm misunderstanding how the logic is executing.
