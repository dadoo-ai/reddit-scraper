The sentiment is moderately positive, emphasizing its advanced workflow and AI-driven aspects, though it notes dependencies like MuleSoft/Data Cloud. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user'. | The comment affirms that Agentforce's AI is actively 'driving' processes within user-defined parameters, which is a positive statement about its capabilities. There is no explicit evidence of the commenter's relationship to Salesforce, so the role is set to 'user' with low confidence. The sentiment is moderately positive as the comment supports Agentforce's agentic nature.","Agentforce is actually agentic. It has active APIs pulling content from a variety of systems | the whole point is generating answers and initiating workflows for complicated, multi-step problems | you'll likely need MuleSoft and/or Data Cloud to really make it 'sing'",2

There is no explicit praise or critique of Salesforce or Agentforce, nor is there evidence of the user's personal relationship to Salesforce.

The agent knows to create a case and respond with a grounded response from the knowledge base. | The key point is the autonomy of the LLM and its ability to handle complex jobs that go beyond traditional rules based logic.",2
