The tone is neutral to slightly positive, as it clarifies a potentially beneficial feature (unmetered usage) without critique or strong praise. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role beyond providing information.","Salesforce has internal calculators that your AE can spin up with your client. | There are also new pricing options that came out (ironically today) that allow for 'pay as you go' | If they have Agentforce for Sales / Service, these allow unmetered consumption of internal agents and AI capabilities",2

The tone is appreciative and inquisitive, not critical. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user'.","thanks u/Suspicious-Nerve-487 , this is really helpful. appreciate it. | does that basically mean they have unlimited ai usage (like they could use a billion tokens/credits and that'd be fine... not actually planning approach anything like that but just curious if it's 'all you can eat' for that license type for internal)?",1
