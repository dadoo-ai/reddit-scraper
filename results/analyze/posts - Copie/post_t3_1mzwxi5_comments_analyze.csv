The tone is neutral to slightly positive, focusing on solution-oriented feedback. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role beyond general product knowledge.",Use a screen flow. Generative AI is not the right tool for a deterministic process like filling out a form. | it would take a fair bit of custom config to have the agent prompt the user for a response - OOTB it works the other way around.,1

However, it does not explicitly praise or criticize Salesforce or Agentforce, nor does it indicate the user's relationship to Salesforce. The sentiment is slightly positive due to the informative and neutral tone.","Prompt templates can take information from resources like salesforce objects, and combine them into a pre- configured prompt to an llm. | deterministic automatons don't require agents,  but also agents don't start out with asking a question,  other than how may I help you.",1
