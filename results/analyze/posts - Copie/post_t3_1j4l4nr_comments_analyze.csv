In fact it’s got allot of issues and few upsides currently imo. | For the cost, I would much rather have clients implement something more capable like a voiceflow agent or n8n agents.",1

They express a strong preference for their own AWS-based AI solution, which they claim is much cheaper and easier to manage. There is no explicit statement of being a Salesforce customer or employee, so the role remains 'user'. | The comment is a follow-up technical question about integrating DeepSeek models with Salesforce, specifically asking about using Amazon SageMaker or other methods. There is no explicit sentiment, praise, or critique about Salesforce or Agentforce, nor is there any evidence of the user's role beyond being a participant in the discussion.",Agentforce discounted is still expensive plus data cloud costs were kinda unexpected. | The devops support is non existent..I don't like moving models manually.. | This diy our own ai is multiple times cheaper.,2

There is no explicit evidence of the commenter being a Salesforce employee, customer, or having any insider role, so the default 'user' role is applied. | The commenter expresses strong negative feelings about the impersonal nature of AI, including in the context of Salesforce/Agentforce, and prefers human interaction and learning over AI-generated solutions. There is no explicit evidence of their role, so 'user' is appropriate. The sentiment is clearly negative regarding AI's impact and adoption. | The commenter expresses strong dissatisfaction with AI bots in customer support, citing negative experiences and stating that such bots harm their perception of companies. They specifically criticize Salesforce for not using Agentforce by default in their own support, questioning the company's confidence in its product. There is no explicit evidence of the commenter being a Salesforce employee, customer, or having any other direct role.","I personally will never implement anything AI for any kind of thing, whether it be for my phone or for a Salesforce implementation, and I don’t care if I’m the outlier in the SF ecosystem who will never implement anything AI | Edit: also of note, Salesforce themselves don't even use Agentforce when you start a chat with their support. There is a button to do so, but it is not the default. If they don't stand behind their product 100% then why should their customers? | And to me, an AI bot tells me the company cares more about saving money than offering good support, making their customers happy, creating jobs, or lowering their carbon footprint.",3
