While it acknowledges the new structure is more granular and cheaper than the previous $2 per conversation model, the overall tone is critical of Salesforce's approach to monetizing features. The user does not explicitly identify as an employee, customer, or other role. | The commenter discusses the new Agentforce pricing model, noting it is 'much much much cheaper than the $2 per convo approach' but acknowledges there are still 'some nuances.' There is no explicit evidence of their relationship to Salesforce, so the role is set to 'user.' The sentiment is mildly positive due to the cost improvement, but tempered by mention of remaining issues.","SE hereAdmittedly it is a bit messy, but going forward it makes a lot of these convos much easier and granular to have with customers instead of the $2 per conversation. | Right now, you’re paying flex credits per action in Agentforce, but if that action involves an LLM callout (which most of them do), it also consumes Einstein requests. So effectively, you’re being double-charged | IMO salesforce is trying to charge for features that are almost free in the real world (callouts to an LLM) and are giving away for almost free whats valuable (Agent builder)",2
