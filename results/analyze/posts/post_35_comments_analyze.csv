They express a positive impact, noting significant time savings and improved documentation. There is no explicit statement of being a Salesforce employee or customer, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence.",Wrote my first Apex Class fo an API this week. | I probably saved 2 weeks of waiting and 4 hours of meetings. | A competent SF developer would probably have done much cleaner and faster,1

The role is set to 'user' due to lack of explicit evidence. | The comment discusses the comparison between Claude and OpenAI in terms of verbosity and code generation, but does not mention Salesforce or Agentforce. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role or sentiment towards Salesforce/Agentforce.","In general I find Claude to be more accurate for apex | OpenAI (through copilot) to hallucinate more stuff that Apex *should* have, but it doesn’t. | What was the prompt?",4

The user's role is not stated, so default values are used. | The comment discusses Claude's code generation style, specifically its verbosity and extensive commenting, but does not directly address Salesforce or Agentforce adoption or impact. The sentiment is slightly positive, as the user notes that the extra comments are beneficial for future builders. | The comment discusses code refactoring styles and compares approaches attributed to 'Claude' and the user's own, focusing on enterprise software design patterns. There is no explicit mention of Salesforce or Agentforce adoption, impact, or sentiment. The content is technical and general, not targeting Salesforce specifically.","To create a fair test I gave them the same prompt, to make this more efficient, consistent, and compliant. | Claude decided on its own that the only responsible way was to split it up, and ChatGPT replied with a summary of its issues first | Claude create longer code, but it also comments the hell out of it as a support for future builders.",5
