The tone is informative and supportive of Salesforce's features, but there is no explicit statement of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence. | The comment is a friendly follow-up offering further help, following a detailed discussion about Salesforce CRM Analytics. The sentiment is positive, as the user is supportive and helpful regarding Salesforce adoption. There is no explicit evidence of the commenter's role, so 'user' is appropriate.","All these can be done natively in CRM Analytics. | CRM Analytics in Salesforce allows you to sync Lead and Opportunity objects into datasets, then use Data Prep recipes... | Build interactive lenses and dashboards on the unified dataset for drill-down capabilities, supporting your data quality campaign by centralizing segmentation and reporting natively in Salesforce.",2

The sentiment is mildly positive, as the user acknowledges Salesforce's new features and improvements, but also points out the need for external tools for advanced use cases.","duplicating every single lead and opp into another object just for reporting is overkill | Data cloud can be leveraged here to unify data and report, especially since Salesforce just GA’d their Salesforce core connectors for free | A true BI / analytics tool (tab, CRMA) would also solve this readily and in a more scalable approach",1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user' with low confidence. The sentiment is slightly positive due to the helpful tone, despite mentioning limitations.","Salesforce doesn’t natively let you join Leads and Opportunities in one report, which is why you’re running into issues. | A common fix is to create a custom “unified” object and push both Leads and Opps with MQL stamps into it via Flow, Apex, or ETL. | Joined reports are another option, though they’re limited.",1
