The sentiment is mildly negative toward AI/data tracking, but not specifically about Salesforce. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role beyond being a general participant. | The comment is an analogy about data indexing/search in photo galleries, not a direct statement about Salesforce or Agentforce. There is no explicit mention of Salesforce, Agentforce, or their features, nor is there any clear sentiment expressed about them. The role is set to 'user' due to lack of explicit evidence.","I have the Siri features and other data tracking features turned off for the most part. | I would, but alas, I have to use it for work as well | if you go to your photo gallery and start searching for a key word and see what comes up..",2

The sentiment is negative due to concerns about privacy, lack of opt-out, and dissatisfaction with the product's rollout. | The comment is a general warning about AI and data privacy, referencing Reddit's AI content licensing, not Salesforce or Agentforce specifically. There is no explicit mention of personal use or direct critique/praise of Salesforce/Agentforce, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence. The sentiment is slightly negative due to the cautionary tone about AI data usage. | The comment is a general well-wishing statement and does not provide any opinion or information about Salesforce or Agentforce. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, nor any sentiment expressed about Agentforce.","I don’t trust AForce and I don’t really trust any AI/LLM feature (until GDPR-related laws are passed around data used in the features) | I sometimes wish that Salesforce at least thought its AForce processes through instead of releasing a half-baked product at DF, but an architect can dream | Yeah, I want to opt out of all AForce functionalities on Trailhead, and I’m sure others might want to as well.",4
