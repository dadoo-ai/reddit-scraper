However, there is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce or Agentforce, so the default 'user' role is applied.","What I like from Agentforce is that you can create actions and thus a diverse action plan (update  this, call api that) and then agentice certain chatbots. | To me that is the next step to just chatting. Analyse all of the processes and see where AI in one form or another makes sense.",1

While this is a factual observation, it is not overtly positive or negative, but it does imply a slight concern about trust layer features being disabled.","you'll notice they too are also using OpenAI gpt4o and model spec for their reasoning engine, which requires disabling many trust layer features.",1
