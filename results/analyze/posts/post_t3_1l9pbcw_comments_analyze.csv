However, it also notes competitive pressure from AI-native CRMs, suggesting some caution. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role, so 'user' is appropriate.","If Agentforce boosts productivity, automates admin tasks, and reduces friction for users, it's more likely to enhance the Salesforce value proposition than cannibalize it. | AI-native CRMs could be a threat if Salesforce doesn’t move fast enough.",1

They argue that Agentforce cannot be used without Salesforce and that its adoption may actually benefit Salesforce by reducing costs and increasing productivity. The sentiment is slightly positive, as the user sees potential benefits for Salesforce, but also acknowledges some possible negative impacts. | The commenter argues that Agentforce is not a direct replacement for Salesforce as a CRM, but rather impacts the developer ecosystem. They suggest that, if Agentforce reduces the need for developers, it could actually benefit Salesforce by lowering costs and increasing productivity. The sentiment is mildly positive regarding Agentforce's impact on Salesforce, as the potential benefits are highlighted over drawbacks.","Salesforce is a database, agentforce is an LLM wrapper with actions associated to it. There isn’t overlapping functionality that would cause this. | agentforce isn’t possible to use without Salesforce licensing. Therefore in order to use it, you need to purchase Salesforce. | it might benefit Salesforce from a cost and workforce productivity perspective (less money for devs, lowering costs)",2
