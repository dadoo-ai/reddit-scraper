The sentiment is mildly positive, emphasizing best practices and sharing resources, but does not contain explicit praise or criticism. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role, so defaulting to 'user' with low confidence.","The answer is directly related to the experience of the team implementing it: are they familiar with revenue management and CPQ concepts? | the cost of new implementation will always be lower than full remediation later on. | here's an [article] I wrote about RCA, check out the links towards the end for some more content on this.",1

The overall sentiment is slightly positive due to successful implementation, but tempered by frustrations with documentation and deployment.",Iâ€™ve taken Revenue Cloud live in July pretty much as Solo Architect / Consultant for two seperate clients | the hardest and most critical part was the PDF generation as you can sink so much time in conditional stuffâ€¦ | the official documentation is inaccurate at times and a lot of metadata deployment does not work (known issues) so look forward to some trial and error.,1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's role or direct targeting of Salesforce. | The comment is a humorous, somewhat ominous reaction to the previous user's decision to proceed with a technical implementation. There is no explicit mention of Salesforce or Agentforce, nor is there any clear praise or critique of those platforms. The sentiment is slightly negative, reflecting apprehension about the implementation process, but not directly about Salesforce.","Technical implementation in-house is doable, unless you a robust team, I would advise at least shilling out for discovery from a 3rd party. | May god have mercy on your souls.",2

The sentiment is slightly negative regarding the decision, but there is no direct critique or praise of Salesforce itself. | The comment discusses an in-house technical implementation and mentions starting data entry processes, but does not explicitly reference Salesforce or Agentforce. There is a mildly positive, optimistic tone about the process, but no direct sentiment about Salesforce/Agentforce adoption or impact. | The comment is a humorous reply to a previous joke about the challenges of implementing Salesforce Revenue Cloud, but does not provide any explicit praise or critique of Salesforce or Agentforce.
