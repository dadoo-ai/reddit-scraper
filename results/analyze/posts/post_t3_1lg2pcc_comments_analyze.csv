There is no explicit statement of being a Salesforce employee, customer, or other insider, so the role is set to 'user' with low confidence. The sentiment is positive due to the praise of Salesforce's study materials and workshops.","I took the certification exam last month, and all the questions had multiple choice answers | I did use the FoF study guide and practice tests | I also completed every trailhead module/trailmix that I could find including both Agentblazer levels",1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user'. The sentiment is moderately positive due to the recommendation and praise.","I recommend going through the Trailhead learning paths. They are free, include hands-on practice, and the Superbadge from the relevant trail really helps with both passing the exam and gaining practical skills. | For practice tests, I suggest checking out the ones on Udemy. They are very helpful!",1

There is no clear evidence of their role or direct targeting of Salesforce.","It will be a multiple choice exam. | When I was training to the different exam, the questions could have 3-5 options with 1-3 correct answers. | But if the real exam has multiple choice questions, Iâ€™ll be mentally prepared for it:)",1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's role or opinion. | The comment discusses the format of practice exams on Focus on Force compared to another exam, mentioning the number of answer choices and correct answers. There is no explicit praise or critique of Salesforce or Agentforce, nor is there evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce. The sentiment is slightly positive due to the user's willingness to be prepared for the real exam.","Thank you! | all questions in this practice exam on FoF have just three options to choose and only one is correct | When I was training to the different exam, the questions could have 3-5 options with 1-3 correct answers",2
