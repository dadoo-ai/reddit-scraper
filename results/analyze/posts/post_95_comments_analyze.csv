There is no explicit praise or criticism, but the tone is informative and slightly positive as it clarifies a feature's utility. No evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce is present. | The comment provides a speculative answer about how updates are counted in Data Cloud-triggered flows, but does not express any sentiment about Salesforce or Agentforce. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role or direct experience.","From [Trigger Flows with Data Cloud Data](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.flow_concepts_trigger_data_cloud.htm&amp;type=5): | You create a flow and specify the entry criteria. When your CI finishes, all rows that match the entry criteria are entered into the flow. You don't need a scheduled flow here. | I couldn't find the exact mention of it, but I would say that if any measures change for a unique combination of dimensions, it should be considered an update.",2

There is no explicit mention of Salesforce or Agentforce adoption, impact, or personal usage, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence. Sentiment is slightly positive as the user affirms the suggested method.","Yep, this is what I do for anything that’s “triggered” by a date being X days away.",1
