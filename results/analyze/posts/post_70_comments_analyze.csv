However, there is no explicit statement of being a customer, employee, or other insider, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence. The sentiment is slightly negative due to the mention of a breach and increased caution.",A new version is coming either this week or next and with the breach I am sure it is down on their site. | I am being very cautious of anything I am downloading these days.,1
