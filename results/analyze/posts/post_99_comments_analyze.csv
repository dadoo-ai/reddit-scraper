There is no evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce.,"You can do this with a seeding tool like Own, which also lets you anonymize the seeded data.",1

The sentiment is slightly positive due to the tool's usefulness, but tempered by the difficulty with large datasets. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role beyond usage context.",Third party tools can do it. | We have gearset for deployments and it has data stuff too. | We can use it to export/import data but it's a pain for big data sets,1

The user does not self-identify as a Salesforce employee, customer, or former employee, so the default role is 'user'. The response directly addresses a question about Salesforce functionality.","You canâ€™t filter records by date when creating a Partial Sandbox. | The data is pulled based on the Sandbox Template (which defines which objects/tables are included), and Salesforce randomly samples records up to the storage limit. | If you only need 2025 data, youâ€™d need to either (1) refresh with a Developer Sandbox (no data) and load just 2025 records via Data Loader/ETL, or (2) create a Partial Sandbox with your template and then overwrite the data with what you want after refresh.",1

There is no evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, nor is there any sentiment expressed about the platform. | The comment describes a frustrating user experience with Salesforce data import, specifically mentioning errors when related records are missing. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role, so 'user' is assigned with low confidence. The sentiment is mildly negative due to the described annoyance.",Nope :) | related records can or cannot be imported but the links are still there so when you click them you just get an error ðŸ˜‚,2
