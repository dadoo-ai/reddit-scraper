The sentiment is slightly positive, as the comment is more observational than critical, but it does highlight difficulties in the space.","Been consulting in the SF space (and only SF) for ~10 years, as an architect, not PM. | It's also tough when you roll in Data Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Tableau/CRMA, etc, on top of the 'core' CRM product.",1
