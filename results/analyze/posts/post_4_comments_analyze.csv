Their comments reflect a generally positive sentiment about the process and the evolution to Trailhead, though with some regret about the loss of rigor. The comment is directly about Salesforce's certification process.","Not only was I a judge for submissions, but I wrote at least a dozen of the assignments. | Incidentally, I was hired to build the original version of the Superbadge. | This was why the process was so costly and why the decision to go to Trailhead was made.",1

They highlight the significant effort required and the personal improvement gained, though they note limited external payoff. There is no explicit statement of being a Salesforce employee, customer, or other specific role.",I thought those 5 superbadges were the highest quality learning resources I had come across in all my salesforce education. | A platform who's ability to educate was one of it's likely largest market differentiators. | I think earning pd2 is an excellent education that will make you a better developer.,1

Their sentiment is mildly positive, suggesting that with practice, the exams are manageable, though super badges are harder.

The sentiment is slightly positive due to the acknowledgment of improvements in scalability, but also notes drawbacks like memorization-heavy exams. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role, so default values are used.","Advanced Developer, the predecessor to Platform Developer II, had a programming exercise that was human-evaluated, and it was a good test of programming skill. | The Advanced Apex Superbadge is the replacement, because they couldn't scale the human evaluations. | But for PD1, yes, it's a lot of memorizations.",1

There is no explicit evidence of their relationship to Salesforce, so the default 'user' role is used. The sentiment is mildly positive about Salesforce's past certification approach.","I thought the Advanced Developer assignment was awesome. | Really ensured you knew what you were doing, could write accurate test classes etc. | Would/might be less valuable if they reinstated it now due to Ai, but when I did it a decade or so ago it was awesome.",1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce beyond being an exam taker, so the role remains 'user'. The sentiment is mildly negative due to the frustration expressed.",The reason I failed PD1 a couple times was because of questions about specific Visualforce and Aura code syntax. | 4 options that all look the same except for a minor difference. | Didn't realize I was taking a code debugging test!,1
