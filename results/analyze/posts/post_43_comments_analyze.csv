There is no explicit evidence of the user's role or their relationship to Salesforce. | The commenter discusses a discrepancy in the number of platform licenses versus permission set licenses, suggesting some frustration or confusion with Salesforce's licensing logic. However, there is no explicit praise or strong criticism, and no evidence of the user's direct relationship to Salesforce beyond being a user of the product.","Honestly not sure, I know why I set it up it was just setting up a digital site, which we got access to when we got the work.com bundle. | When I do that all I get is digital sites or sites | we currently have 300+ platform licenses but only 101 of the company community for [force.com](http://force.com) permission set licenses",4
