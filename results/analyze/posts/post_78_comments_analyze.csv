There is no explicit statement of personal use or employment, so the role remains 'user'. The sentiment is mildly positive, as the user expresses confidence in the built-in functionality.","AFAIK Gantt Icon and Gantt Color logic is built-in, as long as the fields are set up correctly, they are used. | Does you field work in the first place, i.e. do you see the icon on Service Appointment?",1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's role or personal experience.","Not sure what you’re trying to do from your comment, but if you’re just trying to add fields - a lot of what you see on the Gantt component is controlled by field sets on the service appointment object",1
