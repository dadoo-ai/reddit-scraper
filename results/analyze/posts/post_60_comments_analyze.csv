However, the overall tone is neutral to slightly positive, as the user is helpful and not overtly negative about the platform. The role is set to 'user' because, while the commenter says 'Pardot user since 2011,' this does not explicitly state they are a Salesforce customer (could be a consultant, admin, or other user). | The comment offers support and a community resource for Pardot users but does not express any sentiment, praise, or critique about Salesforce or Agentforce. There is no explicit evidence of the commenter's relationship to Salesforce, so the default 'user' role is used.",Hi! Pardot user since 2011 here. | eh Pardot is having a bad day. Open a ticket and see if they can help you. | I think it's either a browser cookie/cache thing or Pardot is having an outage.,2

There is no explicit evidence of the user's role beyond being a user of the product.","I've made sure they have the .gif file extension, and saved it from scratch. | I've cleared my cache and tried again and tried on multiple browsers and had a coworker try it | I've submitted a support ticket as well, just waiting to hear back",1
