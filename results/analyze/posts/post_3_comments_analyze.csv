There is no clear sentiment expressed, nor is there direct praise or critique of Salesforce/Agentforce. | The comment is a brief agreement with information about Agentforce Flex Credit rates in Sandboxes versus Production. There is no explicit praise or criticism, but the user acknowledges the accuracy of the shared rate card, which is mildly positive in confirming helpful information. No evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce is present.","it is my understanding that Sandbox does contribute to Flex Credit comsumption, albeit, at a lower rate than production. | Yeah, that looks familiar!",2

There is no explicit praise or criticism, only a neutral sharing of details. No evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce is present. | The commenter discusses Agentforce flex credit consumption in sandboxes versus production, noting a slight discount but expressing uncertainty and mild dissatisfaction about the metering of credits for preview/testing. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user'. The sentiment is slightly negative due to the wish for unmetered/free preview testing. | The comment uses a meme to reinforce the idea that Salesforce does not offer free or unmetered usage, echoing the sentiment that there are always costs involved. This is a mildly negative take on Salesforce's pricing and metering practices.",found this Flex Credit Agentforce rate card that 1 Action consumes 20 Flex Credits in Prod and 1 Action consumes 16 Flex credits in Sandboxes (as of Aug 2025) | agentforce flex credit looks like basically sandboxes consume 80% of the credits that would be used in prod | the setup/developer area with 'Preview' testing is unclear -- would be nice if that was unmetered/free as you're iterating on config/dev testing,3
