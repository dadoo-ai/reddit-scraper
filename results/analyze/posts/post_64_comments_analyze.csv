The sentiment is moderately positive, highlighting that advanced automation is possible with custom solutions, though not natively supported. There is no explicit evidence of the commenter being a Salesforce employee, customer, or user, so the default role is 'user'. | The commenter discusses the limitations of Salesforce's Flow and Prompt Builder for fully automating data entry, suggesting that external AI/middleware is needed for 'zero manual entry.' The sentiment is mildly positive, acknowledging Salesforce's tools as useful for guided input but pointing out their limitations for advanced automation. | The commenter explicitly states they are a Salesforce Developer and describes their direct experience implementing automation with Salesforce, Flow, and middleware. They critique the limitations of Flow/Prompt Builder/Agentforce for fully automated, no-touch data entry from audio, explaining why middleware was necessary.
