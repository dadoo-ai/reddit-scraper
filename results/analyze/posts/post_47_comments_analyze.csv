There is a positive sentiment about AI's utility, but no explicit mention of Salesforce or Agentforce, nor any clear evidence of the user's role.","A prompt template can do that.

There is no clear evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, and the sentiment is mildly positive about the use case, not about Salesforce itself.",That's a good [GPT use case].
