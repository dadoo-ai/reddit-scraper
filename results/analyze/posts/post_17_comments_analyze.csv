The sentiment is slightly positive as the user provides practical workarounds, but also points out shortcomings. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role, so default values are used.","a lot of MC Growth users pair Salesforce with external builders since the native editor is clunky | Tools like Postcards email builder work well, you can drag-drop responsive modules, export clean HTML, and then drop that straight into Marketing Cloud. | most people bolt on something like Datorama (now Marketing Cloud Intelligence) or go lighter with Google Data Studio/Looker Studio connected via exports",1
