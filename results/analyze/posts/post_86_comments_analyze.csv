There is mild positive sentiment about the impact of successful flows, but no explicit praise or critique of Salesforce or Agentforce as a whole. The role is set to 'user' due to lack of explicit self-identification.","Just check the object reference of that object and find the field there. It will tell you which object record id's you can pass to it. | when the flow runs and users tell you how awesome it is, your efforts will be worth it.",1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's role or personal experience with Salesforce. | The commenter states they have never worked with these objects or this use case and are only referencing documentation. There is no explicit evidence of being a Salesforce employee, customer, or insider. The sentiment is neutral as the comment is non-judgmental and simply suggests testing.","The API documentation states StartField expects a string, my assumption is it’s looking for the name of the field, not the value | It looks like you’re trying to set it to record.StartDate and setting the value. Try just putting the field API name | Not sure. This is easy enough to test to confirm, I’ve never worked with these objects or this use case, was just reading the documentation",2

The sentiment is slightly negative due to the frustration and concern expressed about a possible platform limitation, but the comment is focused on troubleshooting rather than broad criticism.","When I try to create the calendar record for a shared group, the Flow fails with an `INVALID_CROSS_REFERENCE_KEY` error. | I have a bad feeling this is telling me I can't use a flow to create a record in a shared group calendar (I am hoping my feeling is wrong, though!).",1

The user describes this as a common problem and suggests workarounds, indicating some frustration with Salesforce's handling of field mappings and validation. The sentiment is mildly negative due to the described brittleness and limitations of Salesforce flows, though the user offers constructive solutions.","The error you're seeing is classic Salesforce being weird about field mappings in flows. | Having worked with hundreds of companies on automation, this exact FIELD_INTEGRITY_EXCEPTION comes up constantly | Flows are great for simple automation but they get brittle when dealing with complex object relationships like CalendarView.",1
