There is no explicit statement of personal use or employment, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence. The sentiment is slightly positive due to the reassurance about admin permissions and transparency. | The comment discusses Agentforce's transparency and debugging features, suggesting a mildly positive view by reassuring users about access controls. However, there is no explicit statement of personal use or employment, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence.",A lot of these are openly displayed when you test the agent in agent builder within setup. | Itâ€™s used for transparency and debugging. | only get access to it if youâ€™re an admin with the relevant permissions - so need not worry,2

There is no explicit mention of Salesforce or Agentforce adoption or impact, nor is there any clear praise or critique directed at Salesforce. The role is set to 'user' due to lack of explicit self-identification.",I am struggling to understand the risk here? How is knowing system prompt in this situation hurting anyone unless we are able to override it? | By using own LLM connector we can already see whole prompt passed when invoking prompt templates (and it is really small) | I would assume if eventually BYOM comes to agents system prompt will not be a massive secret anyhow.,1

The sentiment is slightly positive, as they acknowledge protections in place, but also recommend further testing. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role, so defaulting to 'user' with low confidence.",you are testing INTERNAL agentforce/copilot functionality | every action allows for an authorization check and doing basic authentication before allowing any actions protects you even further | I think you should talk to someone at Salesforce about this so they can test it further,1

The tone is neutral to slightly positive, showing curiosity and constructive engagement rather than criticism or praise. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce.","Salesforce is API driven so all in and output should go through the API, which you can sniff. | you can try to publish a bot to experience cloud and see if the prompts are shared with a guest user too. | API testing was on my list .

While it references AI agents and their risks, it does not specifically target Salesforce or Agentforce, nor does it indicate the commenterâ€™s direct relationship to Salesforce. The sentiment is somewhat negative due to the focus on risks and potential for exploitation. | The comment discusses technical aspects of Agentforce's backend and its behavior when prompted for sensitive information, noting that both internal and end-user facing agents use the same engine and generally decline to reveal system prompts.

The tone is mildly positive, reassuring users about security. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role, so 'user' is selected with low confidence.","Publishing those rules much like handing out your .htaccess file or database credentials gives adversaries the exact payloads and injection points they need to bypass filters, subvert workflows, or exfiltrate data. | In a hosted environment, your prompts are the confidential, serverâ€‘only logic enforcing authentication, input validation, and error handling; exposing them invites the same routing, injection, and privilegeâ€‘escalation attacks that have plagued web applications for decades. | AI agents need to be treated as an untrusted client (just like an external client calling a REST API).",8
