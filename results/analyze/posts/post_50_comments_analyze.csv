The sentiment is mildly positive, highlighting the flexibility and capabilities of exposing Field Service objects, but does not express strong praise or criticism. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce.","Salesforce Field Service doesnâ€™t come with a standalone customer-facing portal out of the box. | you can expose Field Service objects (like Work Orders, Service Appointments, Assets, etc.) in the portal, so customers can track status, book/reschedule visits, or raise cases depending on how you configure it. | Experience Cloud acts as the front-end, and Field Service provides the data.",1

There is no explicit statement of personal use or employment, so the role remains 'user'. The sentiment is slightly positive as the comment is informative and neutral, not critical.","Yes, FSL uses Experience Cloud | what external users can do depends upon the license they have and how it's configured.",1

There is no evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, nor is there a clear sentiment about Salesforce or Agentforce adoption.","Experience cloud is just a portal. You would still need to create the pages, permissions, sharing rules, etc for the site users",1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's role, so the default 'user' is applied with low confidence.","Experience Cloud is clunky at best and expensive at worse. Not the best solution for every situation. | Are you wanting for the clients to see their upcoming appointments, or what is the exact use case for the customer service portal?",1
