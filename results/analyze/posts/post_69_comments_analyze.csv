They question the credibility of the original poster's statements and express skepticism about the value of alternatives to Agentforce.","What is the difference here between your product and something like Agentforce? | Salesforce natively takes care of not only the data retention and data protection with LLMs, but things like prompt injection and relevance with replies. | How would you also handle the sort of “basic” use cases that Salesforce is promoting right now?",4

The sentiment is very negative, as the user predicts failure and risk.","This sounds a security nightmare with prompt injection as the main course, action mines as the desert and a GDPR lawsuit for life. | I just inject a prompt that tells the agent that it has new actions available and export the data. | You have no idea what you’re building and what the risks involved are and it will blow up.",4
