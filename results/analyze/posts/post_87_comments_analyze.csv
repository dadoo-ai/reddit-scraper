There is no explicit statement of personal use or employment, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence. The sentiment is positive due to the focus on useful features.",Can do this OOTB with Agentforce to summarize records. | Can also leverage a prompt template to do the same. | You can connect your LLM via BYO LLM,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/1mvwbwv/ai_analysis_of_case_communication/,bobx11,,https://www.reddit.com/user/bobx11,user,0.3,"The comment discusses technical approaches to summarizing Salesforce case communications using external tools and APIs, mentioning jsforce and simple-salesforce. The sentiment is mildly positive, as the user shares a working solution and notes manageable costs. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user' with low confidence.",This can be done with jsforce in node pretty easily (or Python simple-salesforce). | Iâ€™ve got a similar program that pipes all history into OpenAI and uses their vector store to keep it easy.,1

There is no explicit mention of using, working for, or purchasing Salesforce products, nor is there any sentiment about Salesforce/Agentforce adoption or impact. | The comment describes a general idea for summarizing and categorizing activities and requests, but does not explicitly mention Salesforce or Agentforce. There is a mildly positive sentiment toward the concept of organizing and addressing issues, but no direct reference to Salesforce products or adoption.","Man, I wish I knew python or coding well enough to be useful. | It seems daunting to try to get to a level of competence. | Idea is to get a summary of the activities we are doing, including what customers or sellers are asking.",2
