There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user' with low confidence.","are you talking about a web page viewed on mobile chrome, an internal app page using the salesforce app, or mobile publisher field in native ios app? | Perhaps you can add some css specific to mobile view and platform specific to adjust padding, if it is padding. | Can you replicate on desktop chrome using dev tools mobile viewer?",2

There is no praise or critique of Salesforce, only a technical observation about browser rendering.","I've only noticed the problem in iOS web browsers, which all use the native webkit rendering engine. | Android and all desktop browsers I've tested look fine.",1
