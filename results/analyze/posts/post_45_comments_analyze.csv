There is no explicit sentiment, praise, or critique of Salesforce or Agentforce, nor any evidence of the user's role or experience. | The commenter provides a suggestion regarding Agentforce usage, implying a neutral to slightly positive sentiment by stating that the system is behaving as instructed. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce or Agentforce, so the default role is 'user' with low confidence.",What happens when you just run the prompt without using Agentforce? Is it returning what you expect? | I think you need another prompt template for Agentforce usage. | It looks like it’s doing exactly what you’re telling it to do.,2

There is no clear evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, nor is there a strong sentiment expressed about Agentforce's adoption or impact. | The comment discusses prompt creation and the absence of hyperlinks, but does not explicitly mention Salesforce or Agentforce adoption or impact. There is no clear evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user' with low confidence. | The commenter describes the output when not using Agentforce and expresses a need for it to work within an agent. There is no explicit evidence of their relationship to Salesforce, so the role remains 'user' with low confidence. The sentiment is slightly positive as the output is described as 'correct, clean,' but the main issue is about integration, not a critique or praise of Salesforce/Agentforce itself.",So it is better I create another new template to attach it to the agent. | I will try now and will keep you updated | I have created new prompt and removed HTML things. But now it is not returning me the hyperlinks.,3
