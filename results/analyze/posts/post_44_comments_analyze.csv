There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user'.","I think a roll-up summary field is exactly what this is for. | The field would look for max date of opportunity closed, then you could create a report or run a list view.",1

There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user' with low confidence.",it may be a fair approach to create a date field for each called last_x_opportunity_close_date__c | You can OOB filter on these as you wish in reports and list views. | Or perhaps a compromise - two fields: last_opportunity_close_date__c and last_opportunity_type__c.,1
