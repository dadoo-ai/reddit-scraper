There is no evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user' with low confidence.

They acknowledge potential value in more complex or mobile/Slack-integrated use cases, indicating mild optimism. There is no explicit evidence of their role beyond being a general user.","Still not convinced of the added value of Agentforce vs. buttons that trigger specific actions other than the 'natural language' part. | The better use cases will be when you start building complex examples, multi-step processes that have more agency. | there might be value when you start calling them on mobile or from slack, so avoiding logging into Salesforce entirely.",1

If you are a partner you can create SDOs or partner dev orgs from a trialforce ID If not you can also spin up scratch orgs. | I use these as examples and it's a good way to learn.,3
