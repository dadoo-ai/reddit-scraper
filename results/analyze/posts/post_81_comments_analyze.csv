There is no evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce or sentiment about its adoption. | The comment discusses Cazoomi as middleware and mentions personal usage, but does not explicitly mention Salesforce or Agentforce adoption or impact. There is no clear evidence that the user is a Salesforce customer or employee, so the default role is 'user'. Sentiment is slightly positive due to the mention of long-term use, but confidence is low.",https://www.cazoomi.com/ | It's middleware that does what the appexchange packages do not. | I used it for many years. Your needs may be different.,2
