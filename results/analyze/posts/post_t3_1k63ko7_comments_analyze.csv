The sentiment is slightly positive as the user still plans to attend and network, treating it as a fun experience. There is no explicit evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce, so the default role is 'user'. | The comment discusses the user's personal approach to conferences, treating them as vacations rather than work events. There is no explicit mention of Salesforce or Agentforce adoption or impact, nor is there any clear praise or critique. The role is set to 'user' due to lack of explicit evidence.",You will be sold to. | You will also be able to drink a good bit of the kool-aid from Salesforce. | I think I’ll go and network anyway.

There is no explicit praise or critique of Salesforce or Agentforce, nor any clear evidence of the user's relationship to Salesforce. Sentiment is slightly positive due to the willingness to attend and network. | The parent comment is highly critical of Salesforce and Agentforce, calling the product overpriced, unfinished, and not useful in real-world scenarios. The current comment is just a string of laughing emojis, which signals agreement or amusement at the critique, but does not provide any new information or explicit role evidence.","I think I’ll go and network anyway. Can’t hurt! | I treat conferences like fun vacations not like work events. | The world tour is just a sales event for a semi finished, over priced, product.",2

The user expresses skepticism about real-world utility and value, indicating a strong negative sentiment. There is no explicit evidence of the user's role beyond being a general commenter.","The world tour is just a sales event for a semi finished, over priced, product. | Especially the agents. Useless in the real world. At least for now. | Too pricey for the few tasks they can actually handle.",1
