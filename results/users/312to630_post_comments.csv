comment,Agentforce issue. I am not managing to train it to behave in a certain way.,,"The agent is following the most specific instructions it's been given, which are the HTML formatting rules in your prompt template. The confusion arises because a single prompt template is being used for two different purposes: generating HTML for a rich text field and providing a conversational summary through an agent. The best practice is to separate these functionalities into distinct prompt templates.",https://old.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/1n0jyiv/agentforce_issue_i_am_not_managing_to_train_it_to/nar238p/

comment,Go to URL action pops up Unexpected Server Error,,"Here's an (assisted) take Quick triage (2‚Äëminute checks)
    1.  Try a direct URL in a fresh tab. Copy one failing Site‚ÄØB link, paste it into a brand‚Äënew browser window (not inside the landing page).
    ‚Ä¢ If it loads ‚Üí the link text is valid; the issue is how you‚Äôre opening it from the landing page (URL action + web page object, or wrong path format).
    ‚Ä¢ If it doesn‚Äôt load ‚Üí it‚Äôs permissions/auth or the URL path is wrong.
    2.  Confirm you actually have access to Site‚ÄØB. Open Site‚ÄØB‚Äôs home page and a known‚Äëgood view directly. If you get prompted or blocked, it‚Äôs an access/SSO issue (see #5‚Äì#6 below). The usual culprits & fixes
    1.  Wrong path for Site B (missing the site slug).
Each site has a ‚Äúcontent URL‚Äù (aka site slug). Your links to Site‚ÄØB must include it:
    ‚Ä¢ Modern style: https://yourserver/#/site/<site-b>/views/<Workbook>/<View>
    ‚Ä¢ Legacy style: https://yourserver/t/<site-b>/views/<Workbook>/<View>
If the link looks like /views/... (no /site/<site-b> or /t/<site-b>), the server tries to load it on Site‚ÄØA and throws a server error.
    2.  Relative links inside a Web Page object.
If your landing dashboard contains a Web Page object and your URL action uses a relative path (e.g., /t/site-b/...), Tableau will resolve it relative to the current view‚Äôs site (Site‚ÄØA). Use absolute URLs starting with https://‚Ä¶ for Site‚ÄØB.
    3.  Web Page object vs. new tab.
By design, URL actions load into a Web Page object if one exists on the dashboard; otherwise they open a new tab. Loading a view from Site‚ÄØB inside a Web Page object hosted by a view from Site‚ÄØA can fail (session/switch‚Äësite quirks). Two simple fixes:
    ‚Ä¢ Remove/Hide the Web Page object so links open in a new browser tab; or
    ‚Ä¢ Keep the Web Page object but set the URL action to open a neutral page (preview), and add Navigation Buttons configured to open URL targets in a new tab (no Web Page object).
    4.  Default site vs. named site mismatch.
If Site‚ÄØA is the default site and Site‚ÄØB is named, links copied from the address bar sometimes drop the site segment when pasted/templated. Verify the exact Site‚ÄØB slug in Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Content URL and mirror that in all links.
    5.  Permissions on Site‚ÄØB content.
Even with SSO, permissions are per site. Ensure your audience has at least Viewer on the target workbooks/views in Site‚ÄØB. Quick test: impersonate with a test Viewer account or use ‚ÄúView as User‚Äù if available. If direct URL works for admins but not end‚Äëusers, it‚Äôs permissions.
    6.  SSO / IdP differences between sites.
When sites use different SAML configs or group mappings, switching sites mid‚Äësession can error out inside the Web Page object. Test by opening a Site‚ÄØB view directly in a new window (not from the landing page). If you land on an IdP error or a loop, fix the SSO mapping for those users on Site‚ÄØB.
    7.  Workbook/View names with spaces & parameters.
Make sure the URL‚Äëencoded path is clean (spaces, special chars) and any parameters you append (e.g., ?Region=<Param>) resolve on the Site‚ÄØB view. A typo in the workbook or view segment returns a generic server error. How I‚Äôd fix it, step‚Äëby‚Äëstep
    1.  Pick one failing link and reconstruct it in the modern pattern:
https://yourserver/#/site/<site-b>/views/<Workbook>/<View>?:showAppBanner=false
Open it in a new browser tab. If OK, proceed.
    2.  In the landing dashboard:
    ‚Ä¢ If you have a Web Page object, remove it (or move it to a hidden container).
    ‚Ä¢ Convert your link mechanism to Navigation Buttons ‚Üí Navigate to: URL, or keep URL Actions but ensure no Web Page object exists so it opens in a new tab.
    3.  Make all Site‚ÄØB links absolute URLs (fully qualified https://‚Ä¶ including /site/<site-b> or /t/<site-b>).
    4.  Re‚Äëpublish the landing workbook to Site‚ÄØA (or wherever it lives), then test with a non‚Äëadmin Viewer account.
    5.  If it still errors:
    ‚Ä¢ Confirm user‚Äôs license/role on Site‚ÄØB and permissions on the workbooks/views.
    ‚Ä¢ Check SSO: can the user open Site‚ÄØB home and a view directly?",https://old.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/1myroie/go_to_url_action_pops_up_unexpected_server_error/naej3te/
