    "body": "**Packaging and Accessories**\n\nThese guys come in a nice box,they're well presented and well packaged.  A shirt clip, small, medium, and large tips, and a pair of medium double flange tips. You'd have to be pretty lucky to find the right tip in these small batch, which makes these a bit tricky. They also come with a shovel, but more on that later.\n\n**Build:**\n\nThe driver housing is .. .medium sized, definitely not small and not as big some some IEM's like the Noble. It's half metal and half red plastic. Im not a huge fan of red but somehow with the metal these still come off as very nice looking. The metal feels sturdy. It has a straight cable and non-removable cables. I always prefer removable cables just in case but with the quality of the strain relief I really have no worries about these breaking. The Y splitter and and Aux connection are both a cool metal that has some nice texture to it, it's a nice touch that makes them feel better built. All in all, I think these are really well built and could probably only be improved with a removable cable. \n\n**Sound**\n\nI'm going to split this up in the usual categories:\n\n**Bass**\n\nThis is the probably the best thing about these headphones. I have owned a lot of headphones with both loud bass and almost no bass at all. Currently I listen to the Q701 and HE300 a lot as well as the VSD2S, AN16, Havi B3, and GR07 BE, all of which dont have sub bass that come close to this. I would say the bass in terms of volume is similar between the A73 and the GR07 BE, however thanks to the trust shovel included with the A73, it's able to dig down and get some bass I haven't heard in any of these other IEM's. It can definitely lead to a very engaging experience and I now have a very different opinion on songs like 'Gosh' by Jamie XX.\n\nThe bass is extremely tip and fit dependent but you definitely know when you have it 'right' and when your IEMs are starting to come a bit loose. I am constantly having to adjust and spent hours searching through tips to find one just right. Turns out I'm somewhere between large and medium. \n\n**Mids**\n\nThe mids really smooth, carry over well from the great bass, and don't over present themselves. I'm a huge fan of the sense of detail presented in these IEM's and it comes through in all of the lows, mids, and highs. I'm really impressed with these. I listen to quite a bit of music with cellos and I have found that these definitely do something special. I bought these headphones to wear exclusively while at work but last night when offered the option of all my headphones and earphones I reached for these to listen to Zoe Keating, I really thin that says a lot about they can bring with the mids. When I do listen to rock they really bring sense of immediacy and rhythm with the drums that tend to carry the song really well. The mids aren't anything really to insane, they just provide a smooth detailed sagway between the lows and the\n\n**Highs**\nAgain, very detailed and a bit sparkly. They tend to shine above the mids and lows and aren't lost like I'd imagine in a headphone that comes complete with a shovel.\n\n\nSeperation and Soundstage:\n\nI'm currently listening to Lampshades on Fire while reading this and am blown away at well the many different sounds scattered throughout this song are  presented. Many people will say the Q701 has a holy center stage, and although I disagree, I do believe these earphones tend create a huge amount of distance between sounds while still having them feel as if they're happening in a more centered headspace.  Some people find overly large sound stages to be unrealistic, and although I often prefer things to be as spread out as possible , I agree that it can often sound fake. I believe these earphones create a really large soundstage without pushing things beyond what most people would be comfortable with. I wouldn't consider the stage to be fully, 'round'. I'm not sure if that makes sense. Some headphones and earphones have pulled instruments completely around me, these however create and a more immediate, centered, and well seperated stage, more like a real stage. I can equate this only to going to a concert at your average rock concert venue, as opposed to a concert hall often fit for large classical shows. A classical show will often set up and treat the entire room in a way that will allow the sound to wrap around you and push the instruments apart while occupying and using the entire room. A concert , lets say, a concert in a park, may have a large stage and well separated instruments, but the sound will escape past you. If this makes sense, I hope it does.\n\n**What I like**\n\nGreat bass, goes really deep without being too loud\nInsane detail, especially for the price. I know when I'm reading a review  for an earphone under 200$ and I see 'for the price' a lot im turned off, I say to myself : I want a great earphone, not a great earphone for the price. With the A73, you get a great earphone, not just for the price.\nFantastic instrument separation\nLarge soundstage\n\n**What I don't like**\nThis thing needs more tips. I have tried tons of tips and have settled on the large, but they ever so slowly come out because they're just a bit too large and I'm constantly readjusting. Am considering Comply and that multi-pack of Westone tips. One thing to consider : buying more tips may increase the cost of the earphone, and is really a huge over-sight in an over all well packaged earphone.\nSound stage could be more 3D(my weird concert analogy)\nIt didn't come with ear guides, I dont need them, others might. As a note, I need them with VSonic IEMs and dont need them with this.\nA 90 degree jack is better than a straight one, this guy is straight, but the build quality is fantastic and I have no worries, and I often worry about build quality. For example :The VSD2S  really wont hold up at the Aux end, sorry Vsonic, but you fucked up.\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nVsonic AN16 and VSD2S -- VSD2S is a very laid back headphone. It's good for a cheapo, it's not bloated or peaky or muddy and there's not too much bass. But it also does nothing exceptional. The bass goes nowhere near as deep as the A73 and is a bit rolled off. If you like bass, the VSD2S and AN16 aren't really for you. I found both had a small soundstage than the A73, with An16 being slightly larger.\nThe VSD2S is probably the most comfortable phone I've used.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packaging and Accessories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These guys come in a nice box,they&amp;#39;re well presented and well packaged.  A shirt clip, small, medium, and large tips, and a pair of medium double flange tips. You&amp;#39;d have to be pretty lucky to find the right tip in these small batch, which makes these a bit tricky. They also come with a shovel, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The driver housing is .. .medium sized, definitely not small and not as big some some IEM&amp;#39;s like the Noble. It&amp;#39;s half metal and half red plastic. Im not a huge fan of red but somehow with the metal these still come off as very nice looking. The metal feels sturdy. It has a straight cable and non-removable cables. I always prefer removable cables just in case but with the quality of the strain relief I really have no worries about these breaking. The Y splitter and and Aux connection are both a cool metal that has some nice texture to it, it&amp;#39;s a nice touch that makes them feel better built. All in all, I think these are really well built and could probably only be improved with a removable cable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to split this up in the usual categories:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the probably the best thing about these headphones. I have owned a lot of headphones with both loud bass and almost no bass at all. Currently I listen to the Q701 and HE300 a lot as well as the VSD2S, AN16, Havi B3, and GR07 BE, all of which dont have sub bass that come close to this. I would say the bass in terms of volume is similar between the A73 and the GR07 BE, however thanks to the trust shovel included with the A73, it&amp;#39;s able to dig down and get some bass I haven&amp;#39;t heard in any of these other IEM&amp;#39;s. It can definitely lead to a very engaging experience and I now have a very different opinion on songs like &amp;#39;Gosh&amp;#39; by Jamie XX.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bass is extremely tip and fit dependent but you definitely know when you have it &amp;#39;right&amp;#39; and when your IEMs are starting to come a bit loose. I am constantly having to adjust and spent hours searching through tips to find one just right. Turns out I&amp;#39;m somewhere between large and medium. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mids really smooth, carry over well from the great bass, and don&amp;#39;t over present themselves. I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of the sense of detail presented in these IEM&amp;#39;s and it comes through in all of the lows, mids, and highs. I&amp;#39;m really impressed with these. I listen to quite a bit of music with cellos and I have found that these definitely do something special. I bought these headphones to wear exclusively while at work but last night when offered the option of all my headphones and earphones I reached for these to listen to Zoe Keating, I really thin that says a lot about they can bring with the mids. When I do listen to rock they really bring sense of immediacy and rhythm with the drums that tend to carry the song really well. The mids aren&amp;#39;t anything really to insane, they just provide a smooth detailed sagway between the lows and the&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highs&lt;/strong&gt;\nAgain, very detailed and a bit sparkly. They tend to shine above the mids and lows and aren&amp;#39;t lost like I&amp;#39;d imagine in a headphone that comes complete with a shovel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seperation and Soundstage:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently listening to Lampshades on Fire while reading this and am blown away at well the many different sounds scattered throughout this song are  presented. Many people will say the Q701 has a holy center stage, and although I disagree, I do believe these earphones tend create a huge amount of distance between sounds while still having them feel as if they&amp;#39;re happening in a more centered headspace.  Some people find overly large sound stages to be unrealistic, and although I often prefer things to be as spread out as possible , I agree that it can often sound fake. I believe these earphones create a really large soundstage without pushing things beyond what most people would be comfortable with. I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider the stage to be fully, &amp;#39;round&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;m not sure if that makes sense. Some headphones and earphones have pulled instruments completely around me, these however create and a more immediate, centered, and well seperated stage, more like a real stage. I can equate this only to going to a concert at your average rock concert venue, as opposed to a concert hall often fit for large classical shows. A classical show will often set up and treat the entire room in a way that will allow the sound to wrap around you and push the instruments apart while occupying and using the entire room. A concert , lets say, a concert in a park, may have a large stage and well separated instruments, but the sound will escape past you. If this makes sense, I hope it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great bass, goes really deep without being too loud\nInsane detail, especially for the price. I know when I&amp;#39;m reading a review  for an earphone under 200$ and I see &amp;#39;for the price&amp;#39; a lot im turned off, I say to myself : I want a great earphone, not a great earphone for the price. With the A73, you get a great earphone, not just for the price.\nFantastic instrument separation\nLarge soundstage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I don&amp;#39;t like&lt;/strong&gt;\nThis thing needs more tips. I have tried tons of tips and have settled on the large, but they ever so slowly come out because they&amp;#39;re just a bit too large and I&amp;#39;m constantly readjusting. Am considering Comply and that multi-pack of Westone tips. One thing to consider : buying more tips may increase the cost of the earphone, and is really a huge over-sight in an over all well packaged earphone.\nSound stage could be more 3D(my weird concert analogy)\nIt didn&amp;#39;t come with ear guides, I dont need them, others might. As a note, I need them with VSonic IEMs and dont need them with this.\nA 90 degree jack is better than a straight one, this guy is straight, but the build quality is fantastic and I have no worries, and I often worry about build quality. For example :The VSD2S  really wont hold up at the Aux end, sorry Vsonic, but you fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparisons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vsonic AN16 and VSD2S -- VSD2S is a very laid back headphone. It&amp;#39;s good for a cheapo, it&amp;#39;s not bloated or peaky or muddy and there&amp;#39;s not too much bass. But it also does nothing exceptional. The bass goes nowhere near as deep as the A73 and is a bit rolled off. If you like bass, the VSD2S and AN16 aren&amp;#39;t really for you. I found both had a small soundstage than the A73, with An16 being slightly larger.\nThe VSD2S is probably the most comfortable phone I&amp;#39;ve used. The tips that I enjoyed on the VSD2S aren&amp;#39;t comfortable with the A73, but they basically disappear in my ears with the 2S, so that&amp;#39;s a bonus, and why I kept them so long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GR07 BE\nThese two are actually kind of similar, except the A73 does everything just a bit better with one exception: The A73 is not as flast.

I removed one side of the tire, placed the valve in the hole, then proceeded to roll the tire back on. When I got to the last 10% or so it started to make a straight line across a circle, which was really tight and not possible to put on by hand. I grabbed my tire levers and went to pull them over but it was also tight. I fussed with it for about 15 minutes before eventually putting a hole in it. I tried one of my new tubes, and ended up doing the exact same thing again! I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong? I watch youtube videos and there's no way my tire is as loose and the ones in the video. Any tips for a tough tire?",

I read very good reviews about Frye and own a pair myself. I was wondering if you can help me find a pair of boots that meet both quality construction requirements and a simple and effective look.\n\nI am looking for a pair with no buttons and as few seams as possible. Many boots I've seen have a very pronounced joining of the two pieces of leather that make up the bottom and the part that covers the leg. I would like the front to look like [this](http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/TheBay/8435403614615_main?$PDPLARGE$&amp;wid=388&amp;hei=498&amp;fit=fit,1) rather than [this](http://is4.revolveclothing.com/images/p4/n/z/FRYE-WZ291_V3.jpg) . Other than this, I am looking specifically for a shoe with a good year welt and good reviews, which does not go over (most) knees.\n\nI am looking for a 'riding boot' (a term I picked up from review section), without any equestrian influenced styling. Something very, very simple with few lines and little areas with stitching.\nDoes this boot exist?\n\n",

The Focal Spirit One's and the GR07 are both from memory and sound comparisons should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nI compared these after listening to a few songs from :\n\nBeck- Morning Phase\nJunip - Fields\nOf Monsters and Men - My Heart is an animal\nGlass Animals - ZABA\n\nIf you haven't heard these albums give em a try, they're my current favorites.\n\n\nBox/presentation -\n\nThey come in a small cardboard box that is thin and easily damaged in transit. The box has a decent amount of Chinese writing that I cannot decipher and a frequency response graph that is most definitely a lie. The headphones are in a case and neither the case nor headphones were damage, box was full of scratches and a den tor two.\n\nBuild-\n\nThese guys are built like a very expensive headphone . Lots of metal used with a soft headband and very soft ear pads. The headphone is quite comfortable and definitely good for a couple hours of use. I find the build to be just as good as my HE-300, if not better. It's different, but not necessarily better. The headband withstood some contortion but I was not comfortable twisting it to the length I have seen people do to the m-100.  They feel equally as durable ( that is,  I could safely throw them at a wall) as my M-50. The cable is thin, braided, and covered in some sort of shrink-wrap like black plastic. It's  sturdy pliable but could definitely sturdier and thicker.  The cable is short and good for desk or portable use. It's about as thick as my braided HE-300 cable(except this guy has the shrink wrap in addition). It's about half as thick my M-50 cable. \nThe case is equal in quality to the one I got from Focal for my Spirit One Headphones. The build of these is probably better, as they can withstand contortion - although I can't imagine how headphones would ever experience any substantial amount of contortion in the wild.\n\nSound - \n\nBass -  There's quite a bit of it but it stays where it belongs. I'd say it's about as prominent as within my m50's. It doesn't go as deep or have the slam of my GR07 BE. The GR07 and Focal Spirit One both had quite a bit deeper bass than the KZ-LP2. The bass does not bleed into other frequencies which is what I had a problem with my m50s. \nBass quality.. is average.\n\nMids/Highs -\nWell, at lower listening levels this headphone is astoundingly boring, really as both the mids and highs dont stand out. I'm a big fan of sparkly highs in a headphone which is why I decided to give up my M50 and why I modded my HE-300 to not have the felt.(Reducing the lows and increasing the highs). At higher volumes the highs do actually sound quite good and the bass doesn't become distorted or ruin anything above it's register, making it surprsingly enjoyable to listen to.\n\nSoundstage - \nIntimate and narrow. Same the M50, it feels about as wide as the ear pads and about as a deep as a puddle.. Loses terribly when compared to the HE-300, Focal Spirit One, or the Gr07.\n\n\n\nOverall thoughts-\n\nThese headphones are a bit less efficient than my M50 and when A-B testing I found them to be quite similiar if you remember to adjust for the volume. \n\nI purchased these headphones looking for something I could toss in my backpack and bring to the library. I sold my GR07 because having something inside my ear makes me quite uncomfortable, especially after I had one of the ear pieces go very very deep inside my ear . ( It got stuck in my ear while two hours away from anywhere I could get it out). \n\nThe presentation is narrow and laid back, which should be good and less distracting than using a higher end headphone while studying. They actually sound surprisingly similar to my M-50s, but don't make me want to grind my teeth. I cannot tell you why, but I don't quite enjoy my M50s, which is why I sold them. The build quality and sound quality is certainly on par with other $150 headphones. I'm pretty glad it comes with a removable chord and a case, which is very hard to find at this price.  My only real complaint is the sound stage and a lack of sparkle in the upper register ( which was definitely in the GR07 and in my HE-300). \nAll in all, I would choose these over the m50 for sure. These are also the only real budget PORTABLE can I have enjoyed using, definitely worth a look university students.\n\nPlease feel free to ask me more specific questions regarding any of the headphones in question.\n\n[Did I mention they were $60?](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Kz-lp2-folding-headset-hifi-professional-standard-bass-earphones-balancing/1747508927.html)\n",
