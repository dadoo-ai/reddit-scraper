I used to be hot-natured, now I'm freezing if its anything much under 80F\n* My skin is much drier, and softer. I had very oily skin before starting HRT, now its almost always dry. Lotion has become a must-have\n* Changes have been mostly in spurts. I didn't notice much at all the first two months. Month three my chest went into \"constant soreness and dear god don't run into anything\" mode. Things sort of calmed down for a bit, but month 5 and so far 6 the boob activity has went way up!\n* My boobs (tiny, but they are there!!!) itch. A lot. I expected the soreness and pain, but they go through days-long spurts of being very itchy. Lotion to the rescue again!\n* When people say that it hurts when something hits you in the boob... I had no idea it would hurt THAT much! Carrying things is now a completely different endeavor\n* I lost weight. I expected, if anything, to gain some weight. I'm 5'9\". When I started HRT I weighed 170lbs. After 6 months I am down to 150! I'm almost sure its mostly muscle that I've lost. I'm definitely not as strong as I was\n* ...shrinkage. Most medical literature says that HRT doesn't cause this. I beg to differ. I've lost nearly an inch. Not a complaint, just an observation.\n* Emotional changes: I wouldn't call them drastic. I don't burst into tears randomly, but I definitely am more likely to cry than before. I would characterize it as I don't feel a higher quantity of emotion, rather more intense ones.\n* Nipples. My god. The last few months they have become VERY sensitive, in a very cool and amazing way. I've felt things beyond anything I've ever experienced. \n* Also Nipples. I'm not even a full A cup yet, but they are hard almost all the time. T-shirts with nothing underneath are a no-go at this point. I'm to the point now that I feel very strange if I'm not wearing a bra of some sort. Without one friction ensues, which can be very uncomfortable\n\nIt has been an amazing, crazy ride so far! I'm 38, and I would say I'm happy with the rate of progress. Can't wait to see what the next 6 months bring!",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I hit 6 months last week. Yay! I thought I would throw up a quick list of the things that I didn&amp;#39;t expect or have surprised me so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m always cold! I used to be hot-natured, now I&amp;#39;m freezing if its anything much under 80F&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My skin is much drier, and softer. I had very oily skin before starting HRT, now its almost always dry. Lotion has become a must-have&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changes have been mostly in spurts. I didn&amp;#39;t notice much at all the first two months. Month three my chest went into &amp;quot;constant soreness and dear god don&amp;#39;t run into anything&amp;quot; mode. Things sort of calmed down for a bit, but month 5 and so far 6 the boob activity has went way up!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My boobs (tiny, but they are there!!!) itch. A lot. I expected the soreness and pain, but they go through days-long spurts of being very itchy. Lotion to the rescue again!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When people say that it hurts when something hits you in the boob... I had no idea it would hurt THAT much! Carrying things is now a completely different endeavor&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I lost weight. I expected, if anything, to gain some weight. I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;9&amp;quot;. When I started HRT I weighed 170lbs. After 6 months I am down to 150! I&amp;#39;m almost sure its mostly muscle that I&amp;#39;ve lost. I&amp;#39;m definitely not as strong as I was&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;...shrinkage. Most medical literature says that HRT doesn&amp;#39;t cause this. I beg to differ. I&amp;#39;ve lost nearly an inch. Not a complaint, just an observation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Emotional changes: I wouldn&amp;#39;t call them drastic. I don&amp;#39;t burst into tears randomly, but I definitely am more likely to cry than before. I would characterize it as I don&amp;#39;t feel a higher quantity of emotion, rather more intense ones.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nipples. My god. The last few months they have become VERY sensitive, in a very cool and amazing way. I&amp;#39;ve felt things beyond anything I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Also Nipples. I&amp;#39;m not even a full A cup yet, but they are hard almost all the time. T-shirts with nothing underneath are a no-go at this point. I&amp;#39;m to the point now that I feel very strange if I&amp;#39;m not wearing a bra of some sort. Without one friction ensues, which can be very uncomfortable&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has been an amazing, crazy ride so far!
