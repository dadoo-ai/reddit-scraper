I am simply trying to create a deployable profile XML file.\n\nI'm doing a *partial* org migration, say from org A to org B. *Some* apps are moving, along with their associated objects, tabs, layouts, fields, blah, more blah. And some profiles. I started with a full package retrieve. That gave me everything in the org, including 30K+ line profiles. Those profiles include references to:\n\n1. Metadata that is \"true\" and that I need, i.e., references to the app and associated metadata that is being migrated\n2. Metadata that is \"true\" and that I *don't* need, i.e., stuff the profile had access to but isn't being migrated to org B. These references will need to be deleted from the file manually.\n3. Metadata that is \"false\", i.e., metadata the profile never had access to, and won't need, regardless of whether that particular metadata is being migrated.\n\nIt's point #3 that I'm targeting, *especially* for that metadata that won't exist in the new org. Leaving those references in the meta-xml would cause the profile deployment to fail. That's also true of point #2, but as stated, those would have to be removed manually.\n\nThat's all I'm doing here. I can tell you that it saved me a boatload of time!",
