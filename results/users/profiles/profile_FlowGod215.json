Should I just put the entire for loop in the try catch?",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just curious what the proper way to use Try Catch in the Before Save Context of a Trigger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have code that is setting values on a custom object at creation. Would I just cover my For loop setting these new values in a Try Catch? or is this wrong?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just for more context we have an apex error logging system. I am new where I am working and they are asking for all things that could fail to be in a try-catch block&lt;a href=\"https://block.so/\"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; So I was thinking really just the setting of the value within the for loop would be where you put the try catch. But then where I&amp;#39;m getting lost is since this is a before save and you set the value within the for loop wouldn&amp;#39;t it be inefficient to try catch every set of the field from a bulkified sense? Should I just put the entire for loop in the try catch?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

What we were thinking was we could have a flow that essentially goes through the process of creating the opportunity and quote and then auto-generates the document (we are currently using conga but also have CPQ / We also have adobe e-sign). What we don't know is what that document generation/signing process would be on the iPad. Has anyone ever had to build something similar? I know with conga we could generate the document via the API and then could come up with a way to display that document to the customer, but how do we tackle the e-sign part?\n\nIf our current tech stack doesn't support a solution like this please give me the hard truth!\n\nThanks All!",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is work. Life is life. Find a job that has good people and doesn’t destroy you on the inside. Somedays will suck. Somedays will be meaningless. But as long as the majority of the time you are not losing your mind and the salary / benefits are legit just go with the punches. I think most of us probably have some level of existential dread as most of our jobs are just clicking things on a computer screen that then aggregate into some report that someone makes some random decision from. I’m sure the existential dread will grow over the coming years with the AI onslaught, but save that fear for another day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
