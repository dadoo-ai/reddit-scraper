Armed with braces, asthma, and a dictionary the size of a moon, he was Earth’s brightest hope.\n\n“Your word is: *Skwǝlt’n’zhurk,*” buzzed the insectoid announcer.\n\nTimmy blinked. “Uh… language of origin?”\n\n“Proto-Garglaxian,” the announcer hissed, “by way of Andromedan street slang.”\n\nTimmy adjusted his glasses. “Can you use it in a sentence?”\n\n“‘The Skwǝlt’n’zhurk exploded because someone sat on it.’”\n\nTimmy closed his eyes. He could *feel* the spelling… or possibly a nosebleed coming on.\n\n“S… K… W… uh… glottal stop? Q?…”\n\nThe audience leaned in — some with eight eyes, others with none.\n\n“...T-N-apostrophe-Z-H-U-R-K?”\n\nA dramatic pause.\n\nThe announcer’s antennae quivered. “Correct.”\n\nThe crowd erupted in applause, steam, goo, and interpretive dance.\n\nTimmy was awarded the Golden Dictionary, a crown made of ancient punctuation marks, and lifetime supply of moon-jelly pudding.\n\nBut scandal struck minutes later.\n\nThe word? It didn’t *exist*. Turns out, a drunken space-weasel hacked the official lexicon the night before and just typed random letters.\n\nTimmy, however, was still hailed as a genius. Because honestly, spelling *Skwǝlt’n’zhurk* right — even by accident — was still more impressive than anything the reigning champions had done.\n\nLater, Timmy was offered a position teaching linguistics at the University of Venus.\n\nHe accepted — as long as he could bring his mom.",

He could &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the spelling… or possibly a nosebleed coming on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“S… K… W… uh… glottal stop? Q?…”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The audience leaned in — some with eight eyes, others with none.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“...T-N-apostrophe-Z-H-U-R-K?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A dramatic pause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The announcer’s antennae quivered. “Correct.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crowd erupted in applause, steam, goo, and interpretive dance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Timmy was awarded the Golden Dictionary, a crown made of ancient punctuation marks, and lifetime supply of moon-jelly pudding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But scandal struck minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word? It didn’t &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;. Turns out, a drunken space-weasel hacked the official lexicon the night before and just typed random letters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Timmy, however, was still hailed as a genius. Because honestly, spelling &lt;em&gt;Skwǝlt’n’zhurk&lt;/em&gt; right — even by accident — was still more impressive than anything the reigning champions had done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, Timmy was offered a position teaching linguistics at the University of Venus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He accepted — as long as he could bring his mom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The Romans built a temple in his honor, worshipping what they called “The Noodles of Destiny.” Harold didn’t complain—until someone tried to sacrifice a goat in his honor.

He shall lead us!”\n\nHarold tried to explain he wasn’t a messiah, just a guy who liked carbs. But before he could escape, the microwave zapped again, this time taking him to the **Middle Ages**, where he was immediately accused of being a “witch-kitchen.”\n\n“I just wanted lunch!” he yelled as peasants chased him with torches.\n\nFinally, after one last desperate button mash, Harold returned to his kitchen—just as the spaghetti finished reheating.\n\nThe microwave dinged cheerfully.\n\nHarold sat down, exhausted and slightly smoky, muttering to himself, “From now on, I’m eating cold sandwiches.”",

    "body": "In the year 2142, time travel had become so common that it wasn’t just a scientific marvel anymore. It was a fast-food gimmick.\n\n\"Introducing the **Time-Travel Taco**!\" shouted the holographic ad that flashed across every screen. \"One bite, and you'll experience the flavors of the past, present, and future. No need to wait for history class. Just eat!\"\n\nMax, a history enthusiast, was intrigued. He loved tacos, and the idea of tasting history was irresistible. He walked into **TacoChrono**, the latest taco chain to emerge from the \"Time Flavor\" revolution.\n\nInside, the walls were lined with strange, glowing clocks, and a friendly AI waiter in the shape of a burrito greeted him.\n\n\"Welcome to TacoChrono! Ready to time-travel through flavor?\" the burrito asked, beaming.\n\nMax nodded eagerly. \"Yes! I’ll take one **Prehistoric BBQ**, a **Victorian Sriracha**, and... what’s this? **2023 Fusion?**”\n\nThe burrito blinked. \"Ah, an adventurous choice! The **2023 Fusion** will make your taste buds feel slightly overwhelmed and existentially confused. It’s a mix of pizza, avocado toast, and a sprinkle of YouTube comment section.\"\n\nMax hesitated. \"That sounds… weird.\"\n\nThe burrito nodded knowingly. \"It’s a modern experience.\"\n\nMax shrugged. “Alright, I’ll try it.”\n\nA few moments later, he sat at a table with his tacos. The **Prehistoric BBQ** tasted smoky and wild, like something cooked by cavemen on a campfire. The **Victorian Sriracha** was sophisticated with an odd hint of… lavender?\n\nBut when he took a bite of the **2023 Fusion**, everything went sideways.\n\nSuddenly, Max was standing on a beach in 2023, staring at an influencer in neon pink yoga pants talking about their morning smoothie while holding an avocado. A delivery drone zoomed past, delivering artisanal dog food.\n\n\"Wait, what?\" Max blinked, confused. \"Am I… in 2023?\"\n\nBefore he could process it, the influencer handed him a smoothie and yelled, \"OMG, you HAVE to try this! It's gluten-free and made from organic unicorn tears!\"\n\nMax took a sip. It tasted like regret and overpriced kale.\n\nIn an instant, he was back at the taco restaurant, still holding the 2023 Fusion taco.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year 2142, time travel had become so common that it wasn’t just a scientific marvel anymore. It was a fast-food gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Introducing the &lt;strong&gt;Time-Travel Taco&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;quot; shouted the holographic ad that flashed across every screen. &amp;quot;One bite, and you&amp;#39;ll experience the flavors of the past, present, and future. No need to wait for history class. Just eat!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max, a history enthusiast, was intrigued. He loved tacos, and the idea of tasting history was irresistible. He walked into &lt;strong&gt;TacoChrono&lt;/strong&gt;, the latest taco chain to emerge from the &amp;quot;Time Flavor&amp;quot; revolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside, the walls were lined with strange, glowing clocks, and a friendly AI waiter in the shape of a burrito greeted him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to TacoChrono! Ready to time-travel through flavor?&amp;quot; the burrito asked, beaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max nodded eagerly. &amp;quot;Yes! I’ll take one &lt;strong&gt;Prehistoric BBQ&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Victorian Sriracha&lt;/strong&gt;, and... what’s this? &lt;strong&gt;2023 Fusion?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The burrito blinked. &amp;quot;Ah, an adventurous choice! The &lt;strong&gt;2023 Fusion&lt;/strong&gt; will make your taste buds feel slightly overwhelmed and existentially confused. It’s a mix of pizza, avocado toast, and a sprinkle of YouTube comment section.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max hesitated. &amp;quot;That sounds… weird.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The burrito nodded knowingly. &amp;quot;It’s a modern experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max shrugged. “Alright, I’ll try it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few moments later, he sat at a table with his tacos. The &lt;strong&gt;Prehistoric BBQ&lt;/strong&gt; tasted smoky and wild, like something cooked by cavemen on a campfire. The &lt;strong&gt;Victorian Sriracha&lt;/strong&gt; was sophisticated with an odd hint of… lavender?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when he took a bite of the &lt;strong&gt;2023 Fusion&lt;/strong&gt;, everything went sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Max was standing on a beach in 2023, staring at an influencer in neon pink yoga pants talking about their morning smoothie while holding an avocado. A delivery drone zoomed past, delivering artisanal dog food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait, what?&amp;quot; Max blinked, confused. &amp;quot;Am I… in 2023?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before he could process it, the influencer handed him a smoothie and yelled, &amp;quot;OMG, you HAVE to try this! It&amp;#39;s gluten-free and made from organic unicorn tears!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max took a sip. It tasted like regret and overpriced kale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an instant, he was back at the taco restaurant, still holding the 2023 Fusion taco. His brain was overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How was your &lt;strong&gt;Time-Travel Taco&lt;/strong&gt;?&amp;quot; the burrito waiter asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max stared at the taco. &amp;quot;I need a moment.

The Moon is currently **overbooked**. Please wait in orbit until further notice. Average wait time: 7 lunar cycles. Thank you for your patience!\"\n\nGreg stared out the window of the shuttle. The Moon’s surface looked like Times Square on New Year’s Eve—if Times Square had robots fighting over pancake reservations.\n\n\"Unacceptable,\" Greg muttered.\n\nNext to him, a Martian tourist snorted. \"You should’ve gone to Ganymede. Quiet. Great lava spas.\"\n\nJust then, the pilot made an announcement.  \n\"Attention guests: As an alternative, we are now offering complimentary tickets to **Pluto**, where the lines are short and the atmosphere is emotionally distant.\"\n\nGreg sighed. \"Fine. Send me to Pluto.\"\n\nTwo days later, Greg sat in an empty diner on Pluto, sipping something purple and fizzing.\n\n\"Not bad,\" he admitted.\n\nA robot waiter rolled up. \"Would you like to enroll in our rewards program?

Everyone wanted to go to the Moon—not for science, not for history—but because it had the &lt;strong&gt;best-rated brunch in the solar system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greg&lt;/strong&gt;, a humble office worker from Earth, finally saved enough to book his dream weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stepped off the shuttle, luggage in one hand, solar latte in the other—only to find &lt;strong&gt;chaos&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A hologram buzzed to life:&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;quot;⚠️ Apologies, dear traveler. The Moon is currently &lt;strong&gt;overbooked&lt;/strong&gt;. Please wait in orbit until further notice. Average wait time: 7 lunar cycles. Thank you for your patience!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greg stared out the window of the shuttle. The Moon’s surface looked like Times Square on New Year’s Eve—if Times Square had robots fighting over pancake reservations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unacceptable,&amp;quot; Greg muttered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next to him, a Martian tourist snorted. &amp;quot;You should’ve gone to Ganymede. Quiet. Great lava spas.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just then, the pilot made an announcement.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;quot;Attention guests: As an alternative, we are now offering complimentary tickets to &lt;strong&gt;Pluto&lt;/strong&gt;, where the lines are short and the atmosphere is emotionally distant.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greg sighed. &amp;quot;Fine. Send me to Pluto.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days later, Greg sat in an empty diner on Pluto, sipping something purple and fizzing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not bad,&amp;quot; he admitted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A robot waiter rolled up. &amp;quot;Would you like to enroll in our rewards program?

There was a long silence.\n\n\"Have you... tried flipping the switch on the back to 'On'?\"\n\nJared hesitated. Slowly, he reached behind the device and flipped the switch. The projector hummed to life, perfectly synchronized.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"Uh... thanks.\"\n\n\"You are welcome, puny human. Thank you for calling Galactic Tech Support.

No one knows where that is.\n\n\"Kiko, this is the highest-level order in company history!\" His boss, Bigmouth Bob, pats his shoulder excitedly. \"Complete it, and your bonus will be enough to buy a small satellite!\"\n\nAnd so, Kiko sets off in his old, rusty spaceship, \"Junkpile One.\" His first stop is the \"Black Hole Diner\" at the galaxy’s border, where the owner, Lola, is rumored to have once visited the Edge of the Universe.\n\n\"The Edge of the Universe?\" Lola flips an intergalactic pancake and frowns. \"Oh, last time I was there, it was in the Ninth Dimension. But then it moved.\"\n\n\"Moved? The Edge of the Universe can change locations?\" Kiko is baffled.\n\n\"Of course! It’s just a concept, after all. Who says concepts can't relocate?\"\n\nTo find the new location, Kiko seeks out a legendary hacker—Quantum Rat.\n\nQuantum Rat is an actual rat who accidentally swallowed a super-intelligent chip, making him the smartest being in the galaxy. His lair is inside an abandoned satellite in the asteroid belt.\n\n\"The Edge of the Universe? Let me check.\" Quantum Rat types rapidly. \"Ah, according to the latest cosmic map, it’s now located... 'Beyond Infinity'?\"\n\n\"What kind of nonsense place is that?\" Kiko clutches his head as an existential crisis sets in.\n\n\"Simply put, it’s the point where, once you reach the farthest part of the universe, you take one more step.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nWith Quantum Rat’s help, Kiko opens a portal and crosses into \"Beyond Infinity.\" There is nothing there except a single sign that reads: \"Welcome to the Edge of the Universe. Please do not litter.\"\n\nHe sets the package down, ready to leave, but curiosity gets the better of him. He peeks inside—only to find a letter that reads:\n\n\"Dear Courier, if you are reading this, congratulations on completing the greatest journey in the universe!\n\n…However, we forgot to mention that the Edge of the Universe is actually a loop, and now you must deliver this package back.\"\n\nKiko: ???",

No one knows where that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kiko, this is the highest-level order in company history!&amp;quot; His boss, Bigmouth Bob, pats his shoulder excitedly. &amp;quot;Complete it, and your bonus will be enough to buy a small satellite!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, Kiko sets off in his old, rusty spaceship, &amp;quot;Junkpile One.&amp;quot; His first stop is the &amp;quot;Black Hole Diner&amp;quot; at the galaxy’s border, where the owner, Lola, is rumored to have once visited the Edge of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Edge of the Universe?&amp;quot; Lola flips an intergalactic pancake and frowns. &amp;quot;Oh, last time I was there, it was in the Ninth Dimension. But then it moved.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Moved? The Edge of the Universe can change locations?&amp;quot; Kiko is baffled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course! It’s just a concept, after all. Who says concepts can&amp;#39;t relocate?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To find the new location, Kiko seeks out a legendary hacker—Quantum Rat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quantum Rat is an actual rat who accidentally swallowed a super-intelligent chip, making him the smartest being in the galaxy. His lair is inside an abandoned satellite in the asteroid belt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Edge of the Universe? Let me check.&amp;quot; Quantum Rat types rapidly. &amp;quot;Ah, according to the latest cosmic map, it’s now located... &amp;#39;Beyond Infinity&amp;#39;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What kind of nonsense place is that?&amp;quot; Kiko clutches his head as an existential crisis sets in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Simply put, it’s the point where, once you reach the farthest part of the universe, you take one more step.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Quantum Rat’s help, Kiko opens a portal and crosses into &amp;quot;Beyond Infinity.&amp;quot; There is nothing there except a single sign that reads: &amp;quot;Welcome to the Edge of the Universe. Please do not litter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sets the package down, ready to leave, but curiosity gets the better of him. He peeks inside—only to find a letter that reads:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dear Courier, if you are reading this, congratulations on completing the greatest journey in the universe!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;…However, we forgot to mention that the Edge of the Universe is actually a loop, and now you must deliver this package back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kiko: ???&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
