My wife and I have a solid ten years of marriage under our belt, and we're parents to three young, enthusiastic dog-loving boys.\n\nAs the initial excitement of having a new puppy is gradually settling, I must admit, I'm feeling a bit apprehensive about what lies ahead. We're committed to raising our GSP right - with professional obedience and hunt training - because we envision him as a true member of our family. Our plans include taking him on vacations, to soccer games, hunting trips, on the trails, etc.\n\nHowever, after reading some daunting stories about GSPs online, I'm starting to second-guess our decision. It's important to note that our puppy comes from a reputable breeder with an impressive lineage. I think this feeling is natural, and my wife doesn’t seem too concerned.\n\nSo here's where I need your help: Does anyone have experience with GSPs in a household with young (ages 2-7) children? What should we expect, and are there any specific tips you can offer to ensure a harmonious integration? I appreciate any advice or words of encouragement you can share!\n\nThanks you very much in advance!\n\n- Scared as shit dog dad\n\n\nEdit: I feel I should add, I’ve also heard and seen just as many beautiful stories about wonderful GSPs in multi-kid households, which is what led us to the breed in the first place ❤️",

In 50mbps mode it starts to drop at 100 meters or so. The only thing I could think of, is that in my haste to test, I did not remove the RX/TX Caddx wires from the Caddx Vista / Flight Controller.

I have also verified the mode in the DJI goggles as being SBUS. The flight controller comes with a wiring harness that goes directly to the DJI air unit. \n\nWhen I power up the quad, I get the initial beeps, the DJI transmitter connects and the light turns green. I can also see the remote in the goggles.\n\nNot sure where to go from here other than to assume my DJI Air Unit went bad, or I received a faulty flight controller. Unfortunately I don't have spare parts to rule either of those out. Are there any other troubleshooting steps I can try?\n\nEdit: The issue ended up being the air unit. I ordered a new one (since I need a back up quad anyway) and everything connected like it was supposed to. I’m sending my other air unit to DJI to hopefully get repaired.",

It&amp;#39;s the T-Motor F7 55a (&lt;a href=\"https://www.racedayquads.com/products/t-motor-f7-hd-f55a-30x30-stack-combo-for-dji?_pos=3&amp;amp;_sid=2e0c4bf66&amp;amp;_ss=r\"&gt;https://www.racedayquads.com/products/t-motor-f7-hd-f55a-30x30-stack-combo-for-dji?_pos=3&amp;amp;_sid=2e0c4bf66&amp;amp;_ss=r&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything looks fine until I go to the receiver tab in betaflight - and moving the controls does nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the protocol set to SBUS, UART5 set to serial RX, and have &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; sbus_baud_fast = ON via the CLI. I have also verified the mode in the DJI goggles as being SBUS. The flight controller comes with a wiring harness that goes directly to the DJI air unit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I power up the quad, I get the initial beeps, the DJI transmitter connects and the light turns green. I can also see the remote in the goggles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure where to go from here other than to assume my DJI Air Unit went bad, or I received a faulty flight controller. Unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t have spare parts to rule either of those out. Are there any other troubleshooting steps I can try?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: The issue ended up being the air unit. I ordered a new one (since I need a back up quad anyway) and everything connected like it was supposed to. I’m sending my other air unit to DJI to hopefully get repaired.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

However I really do enjoy seeing success stories of folks who have successfully paid off their loans! My wife and I are both 6 1/2 years post graduation, each with a bachelors degree, and I'm looking to start 2017 on the right foot and stop doing the minimum on our student loans. The interest on my private loans aren't awful (in terms of private student loans), but one of her Sallie Mae loans seems almost predatory (15.625%). \n\nI have been looking at SoFi for refinancing our private Sallie Mae loans ($30k for her, $26k for me). Does anyone have any experience with SoFi, or have another recommendation that I should investigate? We both have pretty good credit scores, with mine being ~785 and hers being ~720. I have a pretty good income, but hers is on the lower end. \n\nI'm just not sure how to approach refinancing both of our loans. We got ourselves into a mess by getting into student loans in the first place, the last thing I want to do is make it worse. If anyone has any recommendations or general advice, I would be very grateful. \n\n",
