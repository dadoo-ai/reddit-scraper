This is the day we are starting your injectable medications regardless of when your period comes!\n\nAlso, they said they will test me for ovulation 1 month after day 1 of my period however approx ovulation is 14 days after day 1? Is 1 month not too late? Last month they tested me around 2 weeks mark.

House seemed nice, priced well keeping in mind market conditions, checked multiple boxes but had outdated bathrooms, flooring, ugly appliances and roof was 27 years old, little to no backyard , slightly steep driveway, corner lot on hill. I had been looking for a while but got excited to put an offer because after  looking for so many months, I finally found something which would be okay. Biggest reason of my cold feet is the fact we might need to put lot of money into the house right after closing which we may never be able to recover , especially when house is in the area where most of the houses have big backyards. Additionally, house next door which was similar but little more outdated sold 1 year back for 540  K so what we are paying now is already a premium. House in front of this house sold for around 750 3 months back but it is 500 SQ ft more ( this one is 2800 ) and totally updated and has great updates.

First college graduate in the family. No family history of money. Growing up we were doing just fine. We had enough for food and necessities but not any luxury. Because of it, I feel I have developed lot of insecurity. On the top of it, I am over weight so I don't feel like getting out of my home. I work from home and I am fairly good in what I do but still I don't socialise neither with my family members and nor with anyone from work.\n\nI don't know if I like my job but I definitely don't hate it.\n\nAdditionally, from time to time I get anxiety. I am not even sure if anxiety is a right word but I would just suddenly feel low, my heart beat with increase and my body would need some fast food ( most of times its dominos or some high sugar stuff like muffins etc at home ). Then I would feel guilty for next few days since I have been trying to lose weight for so long now. I lost 30 pounds last winter and gained it all back. I am around 170 right now.\n\nAny time I try something new, I panic ( example today i opened gofund me page for helping stray dogs ) and I refreshed that page almost 100 times within first hour to see if anyone donated. I have always been like this as far as I can remember.\n\nEveryone in my family thinks so highly about me and no one knows that I am struggling but I am really struggling. Maybe I have low self esteem? Maybe I think other people have better lives? I tend to compare myself with others alot and I tried to stop it but its difficult it seems.\n\nI don't also gel with superficial people but then I end up being alone always. I am not sure if I have any psychological issues or I am just overthinking.\n\nWhat should I do to help myself? I have around 400k in savings so I am not totally crazy but I don't feel I am living my best life possible. I have an amazing husband and a lovely dog so no issues there.",
