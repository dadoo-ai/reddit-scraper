This is the 4th one from Oleada. \n\nFirst look, it‚Äôs lean and sleek looking. Not bulky but holds a lot: an LV 26 TP (filled up), a MacBook Pro 13‚Äù, Dyson hair straightener, power bank, laptop charger and cable, paperwork. That‚Äôs probably 90% of its capacity. Squeezing some more will make the bag bloated and loses its sleek and lean shape.\n\nLeather wise, outside is matte pebble leather, nice and smooth to touch (powdery smooth - if that makes sense). Inside it feels like suede-like microfiber.  \n\nIt comes with a nice thick strap that is comfortable to wear because the bag will get heavy with all the stuff in it. The luggage handle slot is perfect, this is the first bag I have that comes with this feature - make a huge difference when travelling (I took over 150 flights last year).\n\nThe side is extendable with a strap, there are 3 levels to extend but realistically only 2 out of 3 work, as the third one will make the strap too short to secure in the buckle. \n\nI wear a lot of blouse and long pants, suits‚Ä¶ so this structured bag suits my style well. Overall it‚Äôs a great work bag and I look very professional in it. It‚Äôs not the most expensive work bag I have - but the bags I have from Oleada always receive compliments from my colleagues and bosses. My boss once took a picture of my laptop sleeve and sent to his wife for inspiration üòÇjust something attractive about Oleada‚Äô bags practical and minimal, modern design I guess.\n\nIf you want more review on any of the work bag/work totes I have (Strathberry, cuyana, gucci, LV, knomo, Celine‚Ä¶) feel free to leave a comment and I‚Äôll get to it when I find the time.

And it has been unstoppable for me since. I bought 4 capucines before getting the first monogram item. I hated the monogram print at first, but now it has grown on me (mostly for SLGs).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may add the Pochette M√©tis. I don‚Äôt love it, but I like it. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs enough for me to buy yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another one I‚Äôm looking at is the Felicie in all black empreinte. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to add a go-14 medium in some nice color too, like the green/jade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which ones do you like the most?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It was regressive for a long time and didn‚Äôt show up in any initial testing, and only went full-blown recently which claimed her life within like 1-2 weeks. \n\nI was not prepared. Mentally, physically, logistically. I didn‚Äôt even expect she got FeLV in the first place (due to her past test result being negative), and I went on a wild goose chase of treatments and tests, from blood transfusion, x-ray, chest taps, chest tube, dozen of CBC and chemistry tests... for her pleural effusion.... that poor creature suffered in and out of the hospital for 2 weeks before I‚Äôve exhausted all options to keep her alive. It was my fault to keep her alive that long, I just didn‚Äôt expect it to be FeLV (an incurable and lethal virus). \n\nDuring that course of 2 weeks, I suffered. I felt like my heart was pulled out of my chest from time to time. I wailed. I cried. I tried to face my fear and my feelings.\n\nAnd you know what? I prayed. I didn‚Äôt pray to Christian god, or any other gods. I prayed to my ancestors. I‚Äôm Asian, and we often believe our ancestors are up there helping and blessing us every step of the way. \n\nAnd my cat is still dead. It‚Äôs all bullshit. God is not testing you, this doesn‚Äôt have any meaning, there is no lesson to be learned, my ancestors are dead just like my cat is. \n\nBut during that 2 weeks I really believed in a miracle that can be granted to me from my prayers. I guess now I understand why religions are formed. We are so fucking miserable all the fucking time, nothing is making any sense (because everything is random), that we need to find solace from our existence. Religions give us some ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù why life is so shit. Since we can‚Äôt bare the brutal reality of life, we use religions to cope. It‚Äôs pathetic. \n\nIf there was a god, my cat would still be alive. She was completely innocent, a sweetheart who was very appreciative of life and what she was given. She enjoyed everything we gave her. An hour before she was put to sleep, she found the spot where the sunlight was shining through the strongest, and just laid down in the sun soaking it in. \n\nI‚Äôm suffering and I shouldn‚Äôt be feeling this way.

We are so fucking miserable all the fucking time, nothing is making any sense (because everything is random), that we need to find solace from our existence. Religions give us some ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù why life is so shit. Since we can‚Äôt bare the brutal reality of life, we use religions to cope. It‚Äôs pathetic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there was a god, my cat would still be alive. She was completely innocent, a sweetheart who was very appreciative of life and what she was given. She enjoyed everything we gave her. An hour before she was put to sleep, she found the spot where the sunlight was shining through the strongest, and just laid down in the sun soaking it in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm suffering and I shouldn‚Äôt be feeling this way. I blame my parents to make me here so I have to deal with this pain. And still, religions didn‚Äôt solve anything for me. I‚Äôm still miserable&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But after my criticism she dm me saying stop calling her a shitty mother because she knows the kids are fine with their dad. \n\nWhen I acknowledged her shitty situation, I didn‚Äôt want to dwell too much into why she didn‚Äôt act sooner before giving birth to her kids, instead I said the situation is bad for her but she‚Äôs just fucked up her kids for life if she left them that way. She said they were too young to know anything and right now she doesn‚Äôt have a plan to rescue/re-home them from her abusive husband. \n\nEveryone in that sub praises her for being a strong independent woman who stood up for what she wanted, I said good for her but it was a little too late.

But no, they want people to tell them that they are in the right and their action is justified. I don‚Äôt agree with that. I think shit happened and we gotta do what we gotta do, but at least own it, admit it. I know I would.\n\nSo I want to hear your thoughts on this as well - is my thinking wrong? Parents like these are why I tied my tubes - no fucking way I want to be in their situation and later abandon my (imaginary) innocent children for the sake of my mental health.
