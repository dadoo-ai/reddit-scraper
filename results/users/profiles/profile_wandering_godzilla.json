We wanted to avoid screens to ensure that the kids know how to entertain themselves.\n\nHere is how we implemented it:\n\n* No daily TV, phone, or screen. Kids are encouraged to play with their toys.\n* Weekly movie night where parents pick an old child-friendly movie that has no connection to modern marketing (think Aristocats or Mary Poppins).\n* We allow tablets on planes or we set up a movie on long drives. Only things installed are PBS kids apps, Khan Academy, and a handful of highly curated old Disney movies.\n* We allow occasional FaceTime with relatives.\n* We generally avoid our phones when the kids are present. We are usually doing chores while the kids are playing on their own.\n* If a kid is sick or is otherwise needing attention but we can't provide it, we occasionally put on 1 or 2 episodes of Sesame Street.\n\nGeneral observations:\n\n* Kids don't like TV and actually fight us on movie night, preferring instead to play with their toys. One of them is afraid of film antagonists.\n* When visiting other families, even if the TV is on, the kids gravitate toward the toys instead of the TV.\n* Kids play with each other, their toys, and sometimes us. There is a lot of singing, make believe games involving costumes, and climbing furniture at home. We are present, but usually not involved.\n* They look at, but don't want anything in particular when we walk past movie/show toys at stores. They don't even recognize the branding/marketing for typical kids' media.\n* They are emotionally very under control and rarely throw tantrums when their desires are not met. This is a subjective statement and the correlation with low screens is hard to say (could be many other things).\n\nCons:\n\n* Their language skills are not quite as strong as their peers who watch a lot of TV or are exposed to tablets.\n* They are not very good at using their fingers as styluses on tablets. They struggle a lot with basic activities/games on the tablet on the odd occasion that they are exposed.\n\n*Overall, it has been a positive experience.

We have limited Italian and French exposure but almost no Mandarin Chinese exposure. However, we would like for our child to connect deeply with other cultures via language.\n\n\nWe found a really nice Italian immersion school which has a small classroom size (3-4 kids per teacher), amazing facilities, great food, etc. It's a little farther from home, a bit expensive, and we are concerned what will happen to his education if we ever move away (which is very possible in my industry). There is a chance we may have to pull our toddler from this program in 1-2 years. Would it harm him or confuse him to leave Italian immersion after just a year or two?\n\nWe also found a nice Chinese immersion school. It has nice facilities and great opportunities for exposure. It is close to home, not too expensive (almost a third less expensive than the Italian one). However, classroom size is almost 2x the size of he Italian school. We also have very little exposure to Chinese so we are worried about how we can reinforce the language. Good news with Chinese is that nearly every metropolitan area has multiple immersion schools (mostly with kids with Chinese heritage).\n\n\nThere is also a French immersion school but it would start in another year from now so it's not exactly in the running.\n\nIf you were considering:\n\n1) educational value in the future (i.e. how useful is the language?)\n2) imbibing fruitful cultural values (i.e. what are elements of Italian cultural values versus Chinese cultural values that we would benefit or lose out on?)\n3) sustainability of the language learning for the long term (can we keep our kid engaged and learning the language for many years?)\n\nI know that I am nor giving much more information than this. Choices really depend on individual families. However, if you were in our place and were considering 1, 2, and 3 above what would you pick? Italian or Chinese?",

We have an 8 month old (at this age babies typically explore their spaces by putting things in their mouths).\n\nAs are most homes in the Bay Area, this home was built pre-1978 and had to legally give us a lead paint disclosure. We realized that they never had any inspection so the landlord conveniently has no knowledge of lead hazards. The only thing they are required to provide is some legally mandated pamphlet talking about how horrible lead paint is to babies and how one should *probably* address it.\n\nWe are under pressure to sign the lease right away. We would like to do a lead inspection, but the property manager isn't very keen on it (\"if you are uncomfortable, then don't sign and we will find someone else\"). It's a landlord's market here right now so that's a huge waste of time (and fees) for us to drop the application (plus most places were built pre-1978).\n\nA few questions about our rights:\n\n1. Do we have any legal right to get an inspection done before our move in?\n\n2. If we do our own lead inspection and find lead hazards, then (on account of the risk to the baby), is the landlord obligated to abate the risk? If so, by when?\n\n3. If the landlord does not abate the risk, are we allowed to break the lease due to unlivable conditions? Do we have to give them a period of time to abate (btw, any lead ingestion is super dangerous to babies).",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a parent, I can tell you that I feel definitely lied to about how awesome parenting is by actual parents. For the kids&amp;#39; benefit, I try to avoid the thought of regret before it takes root; however, I would be lying if I said I would recommend it to my younger version. It&amp;#39;s a social/moral catch-22. Once you have them, you can&amp;#39;t talk about how having children kills you to some extent. You are supposed to always follow that up with how it also supposedly gives you new life, etc. I wish we were more honest about this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
