We have a 19 yo daughter who still lives at home and is going to school.\n\n2. Busy solution analyst for a global software company. All day Im building solutions, talking about builds, strategizing about builds I could be doing and also (when I happen to have time) studying for additional certifications for the platform I work with. I sometimes work 10-12 hour days if there is a big demo due. Overall my brain is mush at the end of the day\n\n3. Currently living abroad with plans to stay in new country. This requires fluently learning a new language to pass the language exam required for permanent residency.\n\n4.

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to work on learning anything, work on Data Cloud. It is foundational to the AI capabilities and is definitely not vaporware. It&amp;#39;s basically Marketing Cloud&amp;#39;s CDP but opened up to more use cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I would not advise just being a generalist. Having a specialty will really help your career. Pick a product and learn that well. There is always ALWAYS demand for people who know things like Commerce or Marketing clouds as those are niche. Service is also always hurting for people because it&amp;#39;s a massive platform in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
