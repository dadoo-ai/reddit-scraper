But that cost in a field that is hard to find work in this environment is not a bright move. Also, agree with everyone to do the 2 yrs AS degree at community college and transfer. The BS degree will still be from UCLA. I’m speaking from experience having done 2 grad degrees one at UofA, one at UofO. My Oregon masters is IS related but not a CS. My loans are less than half what you are considering taking out. You are making a big mistake. If your family is upper- middle class they should help pay. Will they not help because you wont go to a community college to save? Seriously selfish of them if they can financially afford it. I didnt have a choice, both my parents were dead when I entered university so I succombed to predatory loan pressure. Finally, my mistake was not waiting to start  grad school until I worked for a tech company that would pay my tuition. Two of my friends got their masters paid for by companies. One got his MS CS working at FLIR. Another got their MS MIS working for LAM Research. Go find a job that will pay for you to get the degree. It doesnt even have to be in tech, many firms offer tuition assistance.",
