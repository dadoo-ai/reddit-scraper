Got an email a couple of weeks back from our AE about moving to Tableau with an offer. Licensing alone we would be out of pocket 20k let alone reworking dashboards and other artefacts. When the junior bdr rang to follow up I asked how long until it wasn’t supported and he said a couple of months. Had to remind him that wasn’t accurate….said he didn’t have that answer in front of him. Hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways back to OP - it will probably be a few years but if I was going from scratch I would lean towards tableau at this point&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
