It came with 1+3 Package policy. I got it in May 2022 but RC Transfer took place in Aug 2022. As soon as that took place, I got a Standalone OD Policy with Zero-Dep.\n\nSo now, I have two different policies, one is TP + PA Cover expires in Apr every year. Another is standalone OD policy which expires in Aug every year. Unfortunately, not a lot on insurer offer a system where I can fit in. Talked to Tata AIG, they don't offer standalone OD policies altogether now, either TP or Package/Comprehensive.\n\n# Dark Pattern:\n\nI filled all my info on ICICI Lombard's website and settled on perfect plan and add-ons I was looking for. While finalizing my purchase, I looked at the breakdown and I see a \"SmartSaver\" add-on costing Rs. 10 and Voluntary Discount of approx Rs. 1500. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/565nkdiw6ehf1.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29cdbdce04adf30540b86c905136cd491cfb1940\n\nHarmless, right? Wrong. This is added by default, I picked out all the add-ons I needed and removed add-ons I didn't want, including RSA (have better ones from Skoda and IDFC). \n\nWhat this basically means is, at the time of claim payouts, you pay Rs. 1000 as file charges plus another Rs. 5000 of voluntary deductible and then the rest is paid by the insurer. It's a good feature for those who want it but applying it by default. This is clearly wrong.\n\nTo add further, if you go over to modify any additional coverage, this voluntary deductible is hidden under \"Protection of accessories\". I don't have any accessory worth insuring, I didn't even bother going to that page until I saw it in the breakdown and wanted to know more about it. And man, am I glad I did.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jtyl8bmj7ehf1.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78f12bc068f99fdd37d7285e0a768fa9f7d6d483\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5srqx1v7ehf1.png?width=879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73385a08942cfc8b0beb2441f32e80a24310b761\n\nHow the fuck does this Voluntary Deductible belong in the \"Protection of Accessories\". This is just misleading, wonder how many people may have been a victim of this already.\n\nUnfortunately, as I mentioned up in the background, I have still gone forward with them as few other insurers are providing me with ability to purchase the standalone OD policy.",

    "body": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am not a petrol-head but sort of a perfectionist. I like to do things in the best way I possibly can, it is visible in my car purchase journey as well.\n\nThe journey started with announcement of Polo and Vento shutdown. Wife and I have had a very soft and love-filled spot for Polo GT for the longest time. The moment the discontinuation was announced, we were filled with surprise to an extent and sadness to a larger extent. Fortunately, it was not a shut-down right away. We knew that Polo bookings would be taken until June and for Vento until April end. (of 2022)\n\nAlas, the German gods had something else in mind. We got to read the letter published by VW India undersigned by Polo and I knew chances of getting a Polo were getting slimmer by the minute. I tried the local dealership and they outright said no. Hoping it would be different if I booked through official website, I got a different surprise, Polo was no longer listed on their website which was also very surprising to me, in hindsight, it shouldn't have been. Did some website manipulation using \"Inspect Element\" and interchanged \"data-id\" for Vento with the one that of Polo GT. I received a receipt from Volkswagen that I had booked a **Vento** with **Polo GT TSI** as the variant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fudged-up Booking Confirmation with Vento-Polo](https://preview.redd.it/l4kg70w8qntc1.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9849a79b6a2beeeff53e66289d8c7f5d94b397a)\n\nLong story short, we waited till the first week of May for allotment from the plant based on inputs of dealership but, tough luck, we didn't get it. Wife insisted that maybe if we give them an in-person visit something might happen, so we did. Nothing changed there but they offered us a Vento Highline+ AT in Candy White color. We took a test drive and abso-fucking-lutely loved it, while I drove it sedately, worried not to mess with the TD vehicle, the SA asked me to take a backseat as he wanted to show the potential it had and damn, was it good! We sat down with the SA and got the price down to Rs. 15Lacs on-road after discounts, the car would have been ready to go within few hours of clearing the payment as they had three of those ready in their yard. While I loved the Vento and it brought everything Polo GT had, and more, we still decided to walk out and come back to them in a few days.\n\nSlavia was already out by then and we had been seeing one in our residential compound from past 2-3 months, it was one from the first batch that came with TC number plates, I believe it belongs to someone working way high up in SAVIPL. We decided to at least experience the Slavia once, so we'll at least know what we'll be missing out on. Next day, we visited Skoda and got a test drive of a Slavia 1.0 TSI Style AT. The TD itself was way too short, but all the bells and whistles were very appealing. Paddle Shifters only added to the convenience even in the short TD we had. Financially, without taking a huge hit - we could either afford a Ambition AT or Style 1.0 MT,. In this price, I think we were trading count of airbags, Sunroof, Ventilated Seats and some other bells too. Cue - the second line of this post, I couldn't bring myself to take the Ambition variant. I like things to be at their best and don't think could've lived knowing the same car had better features and some important ones at that, that I would lose out on. Out, we walked, with a very dejected wife. There were no discounts on offer either, Rs. 16 lacs, only good thing was, there was no waiting, they had one Carbon Steel (color of our choice) Ambition AT available in the yard and ready to deliver within three days of payment.\n\nAt home, wife and I got together again to decide what we wanted to do. In parallel, I had contacted a VW dealer in my hometown, and he was offering the same Vento HL+ AT in white color at a price of Rs. 12.5 Lacs, RTO extra in Pune. (Different states). This gave us a bargaining chip to work with VW dealer in Pune to get the best deal, but we still weren't sure if we wanted the Vento.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I realized that we could take a while before deciding as the only variable was the availability of Vento since there were only few. We decided to let the Vento be and look for alternates under Rs. 8 Lacs and upgrade 5 years later, to whatever is the best we can get our hands on with our tightly strung purse.\n\nThere started a journey of trying to find good new car which could at least be somewhat capable of what Polo/Vento/Slavia were capable of. Tata Tiago/Tigor/Altroz didn't entice us at all. Dealing with the disinterested, rude, and disrespectful SA was a humbling experience in itself. What's worse? Their waiting period were anywhere from 5 weeks going up to 20 weeks specific to models and variants. Knowing the poor ASS of Tata, experiencing the poor sales experience, we just hurried to get out of the dealership.\n\nNext stop, Hyundai. We reached unannounced, and there was no one to attend, one guy looked at us and asked us what we wanted. Decided to work with what we had, we told him our requirement of a car within 8 Lacs on-road, he pointed us to a i10 Corporate Edition that was parked within the dealership. The car looked okay from the outside, not into the design Hyundai has been coming up with, I know this is subjective, but still. From the inside though, car felt sturdy and good. Door sounded strong on closing; cabin was spacious. It came with a Blaupunkt Head Unit and music system which sounded great but looked quite okay. It also had rear-AC vents which was another great addition. The on-road price would have been Rs. 7.6 Lacs and only two colors were available, one white, which we just saw and another dark grey. Unfortunately, no test drives, we decided to return later for a test drive.\n\nWhile all this was happening, I was scouring through used car platforms as I remembered [GTO's post on how an expensive car can come out to be way cheaper if it is held for a longer period](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/buying-car/215247-how-more-expensive-car-can-work-out-cheaper-if-you-hold-onto-longer-2.html). Another reason was, where I live, there are at least 50 used car yards within 3 kilometers of radius. Often, I'd see something shining and will decide against checking it out as these yards are mostly stand-alone ones and I honestly feared getting ripped off. I was wary because I did not have that much knowledge of cars either.\n\nGerman Gods must have taken a liking to me seeing my pursuit as I came across a Candy White Mar 2021 Skoda Rapid 1.0 TSI Style MT, 3700 Kms on Odo, with a price-tag of Rs. 10.19 Lacs on CarDekho. Since the yard was nearby, we decided to check it out anyway on one of our grocery runs.\n\nWhen the CarDekho SA brought out the car, underneath all that heavy dust, I could see the beauty it was running on the four wheels. We took a test drive with the SA beside us, it was rather short as it was already dark out. It felt just as good as the brand-new Vento, only difference being the head-unit, lack of auto-levelling headlamps and the “Vento Spacemax”, a fancy name for the extra lever provided to pull or push the front passenger seat from the rear. The car, although 1yr2mo old at the time we came across at it, still had the new car smell and a lot of plastics still intact.\n\n[Some pictures taken by CarDekho during the first Inspection](https://preview.redd.it/nmu35suisotc1.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e377acc1c90893808bf0df95e26372930c7e5d)\n\nWe returned to the yard, discussed with SA if there would be any possibility of discounts which was promptly met with a nugatory response. We left to finish our grocery run. All this while, mind was occupied with thoughts on how this is a fair deal when the market is going crazy with long waiting periods and exorbitant pricing on the used cars. Decided to snack on something and on a whim with a mouthful of Vada-pao, called the SA to just book it for us. We returned to the yard, SA was kind of enough to wait for us to return for finalizing the booking, yard only had him and a security guard who were waiting at the gate for us. Took another walk around the car, clicked a picture of the Chassis Number window underneath the windshield, transferred him 5k right then and we returned home merrily.\n\nWe were out to get some sabji and atta but returned home triumphantly with a receipt for a car.\n\nNext few days went into researching more on finding similar deals just to be sure that we were getting the best value for our money and indeed, we were. Found another exact same Rapid with 10k KMs on Odo and a blown tyre listed for Rs. 12 Lacs, on the same yard. This sealed the deal for us. We probed further on reason behind the seemingly steep discount in comparison and found out that this car had been on the yard for at least 7 months at the time and CarDekho follows this practice of marking down cars which stay unsold in their inventory to save on the upfront parking costs and potential increased maintenance costs.\n\nAll this while, the deal just continued to look too good to be true. So before finalizing on the purchase, requested the CarDekho peeps to let me part with the car for a few hours while I get an independent inspection done on it to be sure that this deal does not have anything nefarious on the inside. They obliged happily and sent on of their guys for the entire duration. Took the car to “The Mechanix Automotive” located near Sus in Pune and they gave a resounding yes after inspecting the car inside out. They even pulled out their DFT Meter to assess the paint on the front bumper as the mechanic was little skeptical with how the paint looked, the readings matched with the rest of the car and was determined it hadn’t been repainted.\n\nWhile all of this might sound like a first world drama or problem, but it was an exhilarating journey altogether. At one point, when the Polo was surely out of grabs, all we could see on the road were the Polos, it didn’t help that the Flash Red and Sunset Red would stand out, even came across a Legend Edition Polo, basically the last of Polo GTs with “Legend Edition” badging to make us curse our luck and our procrastination. \n\nWhen I had started penning this down, the car had merely spent a month or two with me, but at this point, we’ve been together for close to two years and 24k KMs. Wife named it “Precious”. As the name goes, all this time and distance traversed together has truly been precious. The Odo stands at 26999 Kms tonight which prompted me to  return and finish this draft.\n\nPS: A little more than half of this was written when emotions were running high on the happiness, back in 2022, the remaining part was written today after we've been through some tough times. It might reflect in the writing and the use of confusing tenses in between.\n\nAdding some pictures through the ownership here: [https://imgur.com/a/SxylDAP](https://imgur.com/a/SxylDAP).",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a petrol-head but sort of a perfectionist. I like to do things in the best way I possibly can, it is visible in my car purchase journey as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The journey started with announcement of Polo and Vento shutdown. Wife and I have had a very soft and love-filled spot for Polo GT for the longest time. The moment the discontinuation was announced, we were filled with surprise to an extent and sadness to a larger extent. Fortunately, it was not a shut-down right away. We knew that Polo bookings would be taken until June and for Vento until April end. (of 2022)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alas, the German gods had something else in mind. We got to read the letter published by VW India undersigned by Polo and I knew chances of getting a Polo were getting slimmer by the minute. I tried the local dealership and they outright said no. Hoping it would be different if I booked through official website, I got a different surprise, Polo was no longer listed on their website which was also very surprising to me, in hindsight, it shouldn&amp;#39;t have been. Did some website manipulation using &amp;quot;Inspect Element&amp;quot; and interchanged &amp;quot;data-id&amp;quot; for Vento with the one that of Polo GT. I received a receipt from Volkswagen that I had booked a &lt;strong&gt;Vento&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Polo GT TSI&lt;/strong&gt; as the variant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l4kg70w8qntc1.png?width=504&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a9849a79b6a2beeeff53e66289d8c7f5d94b397a\"&gt;Fudged-up Booking Confirmation with Vento-Polo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we waited till the first week of May for allotment from the plant based on inputs of dealership but, tough luck, we didn&amp;#39;t get it. Wife insisted that maybe if we give them an in-person visit something might happen, so we did. Nothing changed there but they offered us a Vento Highline+ AT in Candy White color. We took a test drive and abso-fucking-lutely loved it, while I drove it sedately, worried not to mess with the TD vehicle, the SA asked me to take a backseat as he wanted to show the potential it had and damn, was it good! We sat down with the SA and got the price down to Rs. 15Lacs on-road after discounts, the car would have been ready to go within few hours of clearing the payment as they had three of those ready in their yard. While I loved the Vento and it brought everything Polo GT had, and more, we still decided to walk out and come back to them in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slavia was already out by then and we had been seeing one in our residential compound from past 2-3 months, it was one from the first batch that came with TC number plates, I believe it belongs to someone working way high up in SAVIPL. We decided to at least experience the Slavia once, so we&amp;#39;ll at least know what we&amp;#39;ll be missing out on. Next day, we visited Skoda and got a test drive of a Slavia 1.0 TSI Style AT. The TD itself was way too short, but all the bells and whistles were very appealing. Paddle Shifters only added to the convenience even in the short TD we had. Financially, without taking a huge hit - we could either afford a Ambition AT or Style 1.0 MT,. In this price, I think we were trading count of airbags, Sunroof, Ventilated Seats and some other bells too. Cue - the second line of this post, I couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to take the Ambition variant. I like things to be at their best and don&amp;#39;t think could&amp;#39;ve lived knowing the same car had better features and some important ones at that, that I would lose out on. Out, we walked, with a very dejected wife. There were no discounts on offer either, Rs. 16 lacs, only good thing was, there was no waiting, they had one Carbon Steel (color of our choice) Ambition AT available in the yard and ready to deliver within three days of payment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At home, wife and I got together again to decide what we wanted to do. In parallel, I had contacted a VW dealer in my hometown, and he was offering the same Vento HL+ AT in white color at a price of Rs. 12.5 Lacs, RTO extra in Pune. (Different states). This gave us a bargaining chip to work with VW dealer in Pune to get the best deal, but we still weren&amp;#39;t sure if we wanted the Vento.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After much deliberation, I realized that we could take a while before deciding as the only variable was the availability of Vento since there were only few. We decided to let the Vento be and look for alternates under Rs. 8 Lacs and upgrade 5 years later, to whatever is the best we can get our hands on with our tightly strung purse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There started a journey of trying to find good new car which could at least be somewhat capable of what Polo/Vento/Slavia were capable of. Tata Tiago/Tigor/Altroz didn&amp;#39;t entice us at all. Dealing with the disinterested, rude, and disrespectful SA was a humbling experience in itself. What&amp;#39;s worse? Their waiting period were anywhere from 5 weeks going up to 20 weeks specific to models and variants. Knowing the poor ASS of Tata, experiencing the poor sales experience, we just hurried to get out of the dealership.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next stop, Hyundai. We reached unannounced, and there was no one to attend, one guy looked at us and asked us what we wanted. Decided to work with what we had, we told him our requirement of a car within 8 Lacs on-road, he pointed us to a i10 Corporate Edition that was parked within the dealership. The car looked okay from the outside, not into the design Hyundai has been coming up with, I know this is subjective, but still. From the inside though, car felt sturdy and good. Door sounded strong on closing; cabin was spacious. It came with a Blaupunkt Head Unit and music system which sounded great but looked quite okay. It also had rear-AC vents which was another great addition. The on-road price would have been Rs. 7.6 Lacs and only two colors were available, one white, which we just saw and another dark grey.

This is quite easy as long as the transactions are just purchases/credit. It gets tricky to handle sell/debits with Pivot table as there's no way to create a formula for it and that's the part I am looking for help. If we record the debits/sell as negative, it will absolutely show up correctly but I wanted to see if there's a better way to do it. (Another reason for not using negatives at the end, optional to read.)\n\nFew Screenshots below:\n\n[Shares](https://preview.redd.it/xc0g61h8nojb1.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f4206dae4188dd7cfa0eef4f57856b023d689a9)\n\n[ETF Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/vq1vr7janojb1.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06792a1ea687f50c575989f75113ee8233df3c2f)\n\n[Mutual Fund Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/wjrdyc5inojb1.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2a0d6fb0a486400b8f2f329f942873fa242856e)\n\n[PPF, EPF and NPS Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/012afl4wpojb1.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59164b7c1406c36ea429d651958193141d33572f)\n\n[This is what the tabs look like where all transactions are recorded.](https://preview.redd.it/zsd2l9s9pojb1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0424d4d7f533ef2dda0959725fc50ac044523b7d)\n\nIf you are still reading, some more info, I was inspired to do this because I had just started using the r/Artos by u/cynical-bibliophile (a 10/10 app, using it, would recommend), app and I could see that for a lot of things, I could just do a Custom CSV import if I had all the things in one place. When I was done with those CSVs, I just put them in one sheet, some manipulations later, this was the outcome.\n\nAnother reason for not using negatives, as promised above, was not having to correct the data every time I want to import it some other app/software.

    "body": "Hi everyone.\n\nI have been crazy for German cars since past few years. I had always aspired to have Polo GT as a life-long possession but that dream slipped from me like sand from a closed fist. I was two days late in calling the dealership. (This is April 2nd week).\n\nI made a booking with them hoping something would come up when cars starts getting allocated to the dealership for the month of May. Nothing came up so now I am bound to cancel the booking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, the dealership came up and told me that they have three Vento HL+ AT with them, all in white color, Feb'22 manufactured ready to go should I be willing to take it.\n\nOn-Road Price, excluding the Service Package and Extended Warranty came out to be about Rs. 15.1 Lacs. (Ex-Showroom itself of the said model is 14.43.)\n\nTook a test drive, loved everything about the car. Felt quite comfortable, roomy, sturdy and stable at the high speed too.\n\nHowever, just for the fun of it, I went to Skoda to experience Slavia. Bummer. Missus loved it. \n\nNow, I am in a fix. With Vento, we get the top model of a car of the time gone by. With Slavia, apart from all the bells and whistles, driving was a breeze, truly wonderful. Suspension definitely felt better than Vento, went over some bad roads and didn't feel a thing. Unfortunately, the cost comes out to be 16L on-road which is already far far higher than anything I had in mind and in fact can consider I'd have kept the budget for the car to exactly half of it, unless it was a Polo.\n\nI have some concerns - Reliability of Skoda, Safety (GNCAP/Asean NCAP ratings), build quality, interior quality  (Roofliner and lamp panel felt flimsy).\n\nI went through the twitter account of Zac Hollis, seeing his responses to people. It appears most of the problems are either with Kushaq only (or maybe there's not enough Slavias on the road yet).\n\nWhat's your opinion on these aspects - Reliability? Safety? Build Quality? Interior finishing?",

    "body": "Few months ago, I got an offer from Amex making my CTC 10.38 LPA. That was almost 40% increase from what my salary was at that time (7.5 LPA). I decided against it as learning opportunities with my current employer were higher and I had also posted on r/Indian_IT_Salary and was told that these numbers are too little, I should focus on higher packages by improving my skill-set.\n\nI believe I am at a better position skill and knowledge-wise.\n\nRecently, I have got an offer of 15 LPA fixed but I still feel like it's not enough given the hassle I will be going through for the offer.

(Yeah, that's right, PS5 caught my attention, I was already aware of it's shortage so I was checking out PS4 instead.)\n\nThe conclusion I personally arrived at is, I should get the PS4 Slim, play and bide my time for the next 1-2 years and then upgrade, if needed.\n\nI don't have any constraints except I don't want to wait and from what it seems, with the difference amount, I can fund a good library of games on PS4.\n\nThe question is, is it worth it? I read a month old post asking this same question but I think it seems clear now that this semiconductor shortage is going to last long.\n\nAlso, if I were to go for used PS4 Slim or PS4 Pro, what should be the price I should be okay with paying and also where can I get them? I checked Facebook Marketplace and Olx but the going rate for upto 2 year old PS4 Slim was 24-25k in my city. I am happy to pay 5k more and get the warranty and a brand new device.  \n\n\nEdit: I also plan to use the console as a streaming device, my smart TV is an old-gen (2014, 32\" 1080p), Apps and experience are awfully slow so hoping I will get a better experience on both the aspects with the console.

Brand Recognition.\n\nHi all,\n\nA little context on everything here:\n- I am based in India.\n- Smaller Company is a publicly listed company in Stockholm Stock Exchange.\n- Big-4 is building a Salesforce specific unit and hence hiring in big numbers in this geography.\n\nI understand this seems to be a little off topic to be posted here but I am hoping that some of you may be able to help me weigh my options. I was set on joining the smaller company with better pay because what I was being offered by the Big-4 was significantly lower than my expectation.\n\nCome Friday late evening, Big-4 came back with an increase which is still considerably less than what I am being offered by the smaller company but I think it may be a good deal considering the brand recognition and prospective opportunities.\n\nWith the smaller company, I am going to be the second person in the two-person team (so far). They are hiring for their own Salesforce implementation. Their vision is to make Salesforce a source of truth for multiple systems that they have in place for different operations- HR, ERP, Marketing.\nThe above stated integrations are what I will primarily be working on. They are using Sales Cloud on which I have already worked on for entirety of my career (2.5 Years). (Already hold Sales Cloud Consultant, if that's relevant).\n\nWith the Big-4, I may or may not be put into projects with clouds other than Sales, but I will be on a track to become a Salesforce Consultant from Salesforce Developer.\n\nI do want to move to consulting side of business 3-4 years down the line which I think Big-4 will give me the opportunity to but I have felt underpaid for significant time of my career. (Started working with a retail company with a name like Dears with an awesome pay, laid off within half a year due to their bankruptcy along with 150 others)\n\nI am kind of scared too that if I decline Big-4 now, I may not be able to clear their interviews in future. This was the third time I interviewed there and only time I succeeded.\n\nAny input is much appreciated.",
