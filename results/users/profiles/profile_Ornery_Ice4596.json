I launched 5 projects over the past year and realized that I spent too much time setting these things up repetitively. So I decided to share this to you all. You can try the fully deployed version [here](https://mvp.seanchen.io) too. The goal is to help everyone save time when launching your next SaaS, with EVERYTHING YOU NEED. You can build anything. You can learn anything.\n\nI also made some [tutorials/guide](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ad1BxZufer8&amp;list=PLE9hy4A7ZTmpGq) on how to configure these tools. Nothing promotional, just literally instructions on how to set these things up coz it is really time consuming if you do it manually by yourself.\n\nHere's a summary on the template features:\n\n* Authentication with Supabase\n* Stripe payment integration\n* Dark mode support\n* Responsive design\n* Tailwind CSS styling\n* Framer Motion animations\n* TypeScript support\n* Error boundary implementation\n* SEO optimized\n\nI’d love your thoughts and suggestions for improvements!! Also, I'd love to learn more about what challenges you face when you launch your projects. Thanks!",

Quick question for the chefs (and aspiring chefs) here—how do you manage recipes when your hands are covered in flour, oil, or something messy?\n\nI’ve been running into this a lot lately. I’ll be mid-recipe and need to check the next step, but I can’t touch my phone or laptop without making a mess. It's especially frustrating when I’m trying to follow a new recipe or recreate a dish I’ve never made before.\n\nI’m curious:\n\n* Are there any tools or tricks you use to make this easier?\n* Do you just memorize recipes, or do you use apps, printouts, or something else?\n* If you’ve tried voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google for cooking, do they actually work well for this kind of thing?\n\nI’d also love to know what frustrates you most when following recipes. For me, it’s trying to time things properly or misreading steps in the heat of the moment. 🙃\n\nWould really appreciate hearing how you manage—any advice or ideas would be awesome. Thanks! 🍲✨",

It’s a Next.js monolith with Supabase for auth and Stripe for payments—nothing fancy, just works. No separate frontend crap, which is perfect for an MVP when you don’t want to waste time. It’s got TypeScript and Tailwind, and the multi-page setup feels old-school in a good way. Clone it, dump your Supabase and Stripe keys in the .env, and it’s running. There’s a YouTube vid &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad1BxZufer8&amp;amp;list=PLE9hy4A7ZTmpGq7GHf5tgGFWh2277AeDR&amp;amp;index=8\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you get stuck. Saved me a ton of headaches for quick SaaS prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I think you made a really good point which is that people who would actually hate switching between hands and phones are those with very sticky ingredients in their hands. And so far I haven't seen any tech companies doing that. Do you cook chicken a lot? Would you be interested to see a demo if I can focus on building this weekend rather than swiping reddit lol?",
