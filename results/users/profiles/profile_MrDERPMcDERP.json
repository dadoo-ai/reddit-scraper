First and foremost I am thankful for this subreddit and specifically [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/evcharging/comments/1cgw8fz/another_base_level_1450_leviton_receptacle_failure/) (not mine) which made me realize that my Leviton NEMA 14-50 was the problem and that I am lucky that my problems are not worse.\n\nWhile remodeling my house (2020) I had the electrician put in a NEMA 14-50 and of course he chose the cheapest one / same brand as other receptacles. I think he obviously did not have any EV Charging experience (as he is purely residential) so he went with the Leviton. I now understand that was a bad decision. I am now getting an intermittent NO POWER error with both my (Gen 1) Mobile Charger (7 years old) and also my neighbors Emporia charging unit. So now I need to correct it.\n\nAfter reading more on this sub I realize that the NEMA 14-50 setup is sub optimal, which makes sense now. I have two EVs and can't imagine going back to ICE so it seems like making the investment in a proper wall charger is what I should do.\n\nThat being said I am wondering if the same wires that feed the NEMA 14-50 can be used for a Tesla Wall Charger? The instruction manual leads me to believe that the wires need to be longer in order to hook up the Wall Charger. Does this mean I need new (longer) wires pulled through in order to install the Tesla Wall Charger?\n\nI should add that it is a 60 AMP breaker and I am not sure the AWG of the wires that are currently installed. Forgive my ignorance I am just a dumb homeowner. :) Thanks in advance for any and all enlightenment!",

They are on different circuits as the Red is controlled by the Kitchen circuit and the Blue is controlled by the Family room circuit. I have the new Blue properly set up in Home Assistant using ZHA, everything was successful on that front and it appears correctly set up in HA.\n\nMy issue is that I can am unable to control the Blue with the paddle it self. When I press up it doesn't turn on and when I press down it doesn't turn off. When the (dumb) toggles switches are tuned on and off it controls the light just fine.

    "body": "Hello,\n\nSorry if this is the wrong place to post this as it seems to be mostly solar panel related. But they were installed with 3 power walls and this sub seems pretty active and informative so I thought I would start here. Lemme know if there is a better place to post.\n\nSome basic facts:\n\n\\-Located in Bay Area, Nor Cal\n\n\\-System installed \\~3 month ago\n\n\\-3 PW+\n\n\\-25 Panels\n\nThe issue I am having is that the system has slowly been producing less and less power each day for the last month. About 1 month ago it pulled down 54K in one day. Yesterday (record setting temps) it only pulled down 30K. That being said it feels like something is wrong and I am looking for some basic feedback and troubleshooting help before I engage Tesla (ugh).\n\nI am new to all of this and have a lot to learn but so far here some reasons why the system might not be producing as much as it used to. I am wondering if anyone has any insight as to what might be going on and would love any advice on how to troubleshoot?\n\n**1.** **Panels are dirty** \\- I have a large landscaping project going on which has involved a lot of excavation and moving around of dirt and gravel etc. Some of this activity has been directly next to the house where the panels are. When I look at the panels they even look dirty. According to research dirty panels can reduce generation by \\~3%. Seems like this might be contributing to the problem but certainly does not explain a loss of \\~40% . Maybe some of mine are just super dirty?\n\nQUESTION: Can major landscaping around the panels contribute to such a decrease?\n\n2. **I have been throttled** and am no longer allowed to generate as much power as when it was first installed. To be clear the system has been turned on since Day 1 and I have been feeding back into the grid since day 1. It seems like it was not supposed to be turned on and feeding back into the grid before PTO but thats they way Tesla left it. I charged the car as much as possible to avoid giving power to PG&amp;E for free. The PTO process took 3 months to sort out with much back and forth with both PG&amp;E and Tesla. For some reason I had to send multiple recent PG&amp;E bills to Tesla - probably their own disorganization.\n\nQUESTION: Does Tesla / PG&amp;E limit solar production before the PTO process so as to limit me in what I can generate before PTO? I have read about other people being throttled before the PTO process. I have also read that “the system will not generate as much as it can before PTO is received”. This makes me believe I was being throttled while waiting for the PTO which I just got 1 week ago.\n\n3. The **extreme heat spell** we are going through is currently effecting how much I can produce. Earlier in the summer is was not as hot. Not its extremely hot which I understand effects the production from the system. I read yesterday that in extreme heat the system can product up to \\~%25 less. Seems like this could be a real possibility BUT this morning it was not as hot as yesterday and I was producing a similar amount in the morning.\n\nQUESTION: Are other people in CA seeing a large decrease in solar production during this extreme heat wave?\n\n4. **Something is wrong** with my system. This seems less likely because the system is brand spanking new AND I can see a gradual decrease over the past month. If something broke in the system I would expect to see that clear drop off at that specific point in time.\n\nQUESTION: Based on the symptoms outlined here does this sound like a system problem? IE something is not working as expected?\n\nThanks for any and all enlightenment. The timing of this is especially brutal because of the current heatwave. I am now having to pull more from The Grid because my system does not produce as much — which is just backwards.",

Is that correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any and all enlightenment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "My mom bought this fridge / freezer combo 20 years ago. Worked like a champ for 20 years. It went into storage for \\~1year. Unfortunately it was not stored properly so a bunch of mold formed in the freezer. We took care of that and cleaned it all out.  First problem seemed to be solved.\n\nWhen I plugged it back in the Freezer didn't work. I gave it some time and called a repair man. He quickly told me the compressor had gone out and that it was red hot trying to do it's job.  He ball parked it would be \\~2k to fix the compressor and replace a bunch of related parts (\"might as well do it at the same time\"). He disconnected the freezer. The refrigerator still works like a champ. \n\nSo now we are trying to figure out what to do.  \n\nDo we put $2k in to a 20 year old machine and hope that the fridge compressor doesn't crap out anytime soon?  I have heard other say that a 20 year old SubZero is in it's prime.  If that is the case maybe it's worth it? \n\nOr do we suck it up and buy a brand spanking new machine? Full transparency I think \\~15k for a fridge is crazy.  I understand that its the most important appliance in my house and that it should last 20 years but \\~15k for fridge seems nuts.  I am also guessing it will take at least 3 months for a new one to arrive if we do buy a new one. \n\nI have also recently been told the SubZeros these days are not the same quality as what they used to make (20 years ago) . If that is the case then maybe fixing the old classic machine makes sense.  Does anyone have a specific opinion about a decrease in quality (since 2000)?\n\nAnyways - I am just looking for opinions and feedback on my predicament. Any and all enlightenment and comments welcome. \n\nThanks!",

My Nest Camera drops all day long. Sometimes I am unable to stream anything and/or have major buffering issues while streaming. I unplug the modem and router and it temporarily helps. I also work from home so its slowly driving me crazy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I called Comcast (when I was getting consistently terrible speeds) and they sent a reset command which temporarily made it better. At the same time I scheduled a technician to come out and diagnose the problem (tomorrow morning). I also ordered a new SB6183 just in case its a modem problem. I have tried a new co-axial cable from the wall (only outlet being used) to the modem but am getting the same behavior. The more I read the more I am thinking it's a problem with the Comcast wiring outside the house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wondering if anyone can look at the Signal and Logs (below) and give me feedback as to whether its a modem or connection problem? If it's a connection problem I will probably return the SB6183. If its a modem problem I very well might cancel the Comcast appointment (so I do not get charged for it being a modem problem).

This is the deepest I have dove into the inter-workings of a modem so thanks for any and all enlightenment!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logs from this morning (same as below)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time    Priority    Code    Message&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 8:52:41 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 8:03:04 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 8:00:58 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 7:58:51 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 7:58:50 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 7:21:38 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 7:19:59 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 7:17:29 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 7:17:26 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 6:16:15 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 6:16:10 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 6:14:45 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 6:14:43 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 6:05:58 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 6:05:58 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 5:55:20 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 5:54:18 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 5:52:35 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 5:52:23 3-Critical  T05.0   SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Loss of Sync;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 26 2019 5:50:20 3-Critical  R02.0   No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=78:96:84:fa:4e:15;CMTS-MAC=00:01:5c:64:3e:53;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logs: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/tlZzatv\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/tlZzatv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Signal: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/EspAtrx\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/EspAtrx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am intrigued by the idea of a printed Reflective Vinyl Sticker that I can stick on the front. I saw a Model X at the Tesla Store in SF that had it and I think it looks better than the real thing. I understand that this is probably not exactly legal (in CA) but I think a judge/cop would probably not spank me that hard if its my own plate.\n\nIs there anyone out there that has a printed Vinyl Sticker front plate that has had either good or bad experiences with parking control or law enforcement officers pertaining to the Vinyl Sticker front plate?\n\nThanks for any and all enlightenment!",

[This] (http://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?id=000003890&amp;language=en_US) help doc confirms that.\n\nWhen I look at the Opportunity Sub Tab of the Forecast tab I find a Forecast Date which is completely different.  Meaning if I report on the same Opportunity in a forecast report I get a different Forecast Date value for the same Oppty.  This Forecast Date is also sometimes blank for some records in the Forecast Tab.  This Forecast date also appears to always be the First of the month.  \n\nThis leads me to believe the the Forecast Date on the Opportunity Sub Tab of the Forecast tab is populated when the Forecast Period is overridden.
