What’s worse is the tone that burning a flag in and of itself could be perceived as inciting violence, etc.  \n\nWhether or not being arrested on charges loosely connected to flag charges amounts to anything in the real world or not, I as a citizen am disadvantaged from doing so because I don’t want to be prosecuted.",

The actual order states:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s rulings on First Amendment protections, the Court has never held that American Flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to “fighting words” is constitutionally protected.  See Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 408-10 (1989).”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual meat of the order basically states that for anyone burning a flag, they can expect to be prosecuted for any related offense that might be applicable.  What’s worse is the tone that burning a flag in and of itself could be perceived as inciting violence, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether or not being arrested on charges loosely connected to flag charges amounts to anything in the real world or not, I as a citizen am disadvantaged from doing so because I don’t want to be prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On one machine we changed the server ports, but that didn't help.  Tried running the game and server in various ways, skipping the launcher.

I’m worried that if I contact support that I will be given the run around unless I am able to clearly articulate the issues.\n\n1) Audio sync issues in several apps including Hulu, Prime, and HBO Max.  No soundbar , just native TV sound.  Sound is regularly off by 500ms and up to several seconds.\n\n2) Strange visual artifacts observed in all streaming apps.  It’s hard to describe, but when a bright object moves on the screen I occasionally see “black squares.”  As if the TV isn’t able to keep up and is dropping bits of image.\n\n3) Random WIFI disconnects and occasionally doesn’t like to turn on with the remote and has to be unplugged (this has gotten better but at least every couple weeks one of these things happens).\n\nI have done a full factory reset, and even went so far as to hard wire the TV in case there was a WIFI issue.  I’ve done all the updates and remote updates.  I have an A8H on the same network with zero issues.\n\nI literally hate turning this TV on and feel like I’m just screwed.
