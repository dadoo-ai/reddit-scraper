Just don‘t activate it and it won’t cost you extra money.“\n+1 Agentforce Customer\n\nThe pricing is complex. You have different license levels (Enterprise, Unlimited…) which are payed by user/month mostly. If you have a very high level you have Agentforce included (around 500$ user/month - but no one pays list price).
