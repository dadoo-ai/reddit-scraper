    "body": "I was very interested to hear the different views from the comments in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/sjmsac/homemade_vanilla_extract_is_it_worth_it/). Is store bought vanilla really better than homemade?\n\nI read what Stella Parks had to say on the subject and she has mostly steered us right thus far so I couldn't outright dismiss her. But I couldn't help wondering if all the commenters saying that their homemade is much better or at least as good were right. So I decided to do a little experiment.\n\nI've been making my own vanilla extract for years (according to some it isn't actually extract but vanilla-infused vodka) by taking 7 vanilla beans and putting them in a bottle with about 1c of vodka and leaving it for at least 6 weeks. So I had some of that available.\n\nI bought a bottle of good store-bought pure vanilla extract.\n\nI decided to try something different. I put 6 vanilla beans and some 90-proof bourbon in an 8oz mason jar. I put 6 vanilla beans and some vodka in an 8oz mason jar. I put them in my sous vide setup and cooked them at 130F for 3 hours, then 120F for 3 hours, then 100F for 3 hours. This was to mimic what Stella described as the technique of commercial vanilla extract makers. I did that about 18 days ago and left the pods in the jar. For the curious, I cut the beans in half but did not split them open.\n\nI made 8c of ice cream base (I think technically it is frozen custard since there are 6 egg yolks in it). I churned/froze four batches of 2c of ice cream each with 3/4 tsp. of a different extract per batch.\n\nThe results? They all taste just about the same to everyone in my house. Seriously. I really want there to be a difference, but no one can tell. I asked my family to weigh in on which one tasted freshest, strongest, richest and no one could pick one. I can't either. I think the steeped version might have a smidge less vanilla flavor to it, but just barely.\n\nMy recommendation is that you can do whichever method you find most economic. I think making it yourself, especially if you do it in larger quantities and re-use the beans is probably the cheapest, but whether you steep it or cook it and in which alcohol probably doesn't matter much. I will say that the sous vide version looked a little darker and smelled  the same as the steeped version. And I like to drink bourbon and hate to drink vodka. So, for me, I think I'll be doing the sous vide method with vodka from now on.",

    "body": "I didn't understand what the Magna Carta had to do with America either, but according to chatgpt:\n\n  \nThe *Magna Carta*, signed in 1215, established that the king was subject to the law, not above it. It granted rights to barons, limited royal power, and introduced legal principles like due process and fair trials. It protected the Church, merchants, and landowners from arbitrary taxation and imprisonment. Though initially a peace treaty between King John and rebellious nobles, it influenced constitutional law, inspiring later democratic principles. While many clauses became obsolete, its legacy remains in modern legal systems, including the U.S. Constitution and English law, as a symbol of individual rights and government accountability.\n\nSo, the Magna Carta was a predecessor of our own constitution and gave new rights to the people. The implication here is that Project 2025 seeks to put a king in place who is not subject to the law, remove due process and fair trials, and ultimately take power from the people. Getting all worked up about the Gulf of America, or nonsense executive orders that essentially instruct lawmakers to do something at some unspecified time in the future takes our eyes off of some of the less headline-grabbing work that they are doing to make Project 2025 a reality--like install loyalist bureaucrats, remove oversight, redefine norms, implant judges, etc.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t understand what the Magna Carta had to do with America either, but according to chatgpt:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/em&gt;, signed in 1215, established that the king was subject to the law, not above it. It granted rights to barons, limited royal power, and introduced legal principles like due process and fair trials. It protected the Church, merchants, and landowners from arbitrary taxation and imprisonment. Though initially a peace treaty between King John and rebellious nobles, it influenced constitutional law, inspiring later democratic principles. While many clauses became obsolete, its legacy remains in modern legal systems, including the U.S. Constitution and English law, as a symbol of individual rights and government accountability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the Magna Carta was a predecessor of our own constitution and gave new rights to the people. The implication here is that Project 2025 seeks to put a king in place who is not subject to the law, remove due process and fair trials, and ultimately take power from the people. Getting all worked up about the Gulf of America, or nonsense executive orders that essentially instruct lawmakers to do something at some unspecified time in the future takes our eyes off of some of the less headline-grabbing work that they are doing to make Project 2025 a reality--like install loyalist bureaucrats, remove oversight, redefine norms, implant judges, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I think your dude needs to be a little older, but once he is, it is a great choice. There's even one you can buy where you don't have to bury wires and the dog has to stay in a the radius of the transmitter or something. I doubt you could train your dog without him getting a few zaps along the way. Our current black lab will even test the fence every so often just to make sure its still there (its pretty clear that it is deliberate). If you're worried about being cruel, I wouldn't be. I've tested it on myself a few times and its uncomfortable, but certainly bearable. It cruel if you don't train the dog to understand why they're getting a correction, so be sure to train the dog according to the instructions.\n\nWhen that guy is 6m-1y old, you'll be happy to be able to let him out to lay in the yard, run around, and watch the neighborhood without you having to supervise every second.",

In your recipe adding 1-2 Thai peppers minced or ground into a paste (seeds removed) will make sure it isn't boring. Buy them whole at your Asian market and freeze them. They thaw enough to seed in 2 minutes.\n\nI may be weird that I use no salt. I get enough salt from soy sauce. I use dark soy to amp up the umami without amping up the saltiness.\n\nKeep three spoons next to you. Scoop some up when your protein is cooked through, blow on it because it's really hot, and try it. Throw that spoon in the sink. Adjust your flavors and cook another minute or two and repeat the process. You can't do this indefinitely or you'll overcook everything, but you do have some time to adjust.",
