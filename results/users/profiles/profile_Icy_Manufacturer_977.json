Turns out my issue was that my formula was displayed in a Display Text field instead of a number-input field. If I added a number input field and put the formula as default, it works.\n\nI do have some issues with this, though.\n\n1) My formula is very basic: FieldA+FieldB+FieldC+FieldD+FieldE. Add them together, show the result. The issue is that only 2 of the fields are mandatory; and my formula will only show the 'reactive result' if all 5 fields are populated. I solved this by adding null-checks to my formula, giving the field a value of 0 if it's null. Is there a better way to do this? Ideally it should just calculate 0 if it's not filled in by default instead of showing no result.\n\n2) Since the formula seems to only work reactively when I add it to a number field as a default value, this means the user can edit it. I do not want this as it's being calculated, and I feel like there's no way salesforce wouldn't allow you to make the field read-only (Which is why I originally tried with a Display Text component, but that didn't work). Does anyone know what I'm missing and how I can make the formula-field display the value reactively while still being read only for the user?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

    "body": "Hello!  \nI'm looking for some advise. I recently bought an Asus TUF A15 w/ RTX 4060 and AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS for work and gaming. I'm pretty happy with it, but I'm looking to give it away to a family member for Christmas and buy myself a new laptop. I'm currently looking at an Razer Blade 15 RZ09-0421NEG3 (Early 2023) with a 3070TI and an i9-12900H. I have read a lot of horror stories about Razer Blade laptops, which is why I'm a little hesitant. I also have no idea about the price; the website says it's marked down from EUR3699 to EUR1699 which seems a little too good to be true. On the Razer website itself it's priced from EUR3699 to EUR2400  The laptop would likely get replaced within a year or two. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan anyone tell me if the Razer Blade deal is actually as good as it seems, or would buying it be considered a mistake?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

I think I have clocked in around 200 or so deaths so far.\n\nDuring these 19 hours, I've killed a total of 6 named monsters.\n\nGoing to add the spoiler tag for the names just in case.\n\nBoss 1; &gt;!Tree Sentinel!&lt;  This took me about 3 hours to kill. I died in 2 hits, he died in 200. I now understand that you're more or less intended to skip this boss and come back later\n\nBoss 2; &gt;!Margaret the Fell!&lt; Took me also about 3-4 hours. Carried by my summoning partner (I play offline, so Roger I think his name was?)\n\nBOss 3; &gt;! Some ghost on a boat in a village!&lt; (I forgot the name, sorry) To my surprise I actually killed this boss in 2 attempts using the horse and running around like a lunatic and spamming attacks\n\nBoss 4; &gt;! Dragonkin Soldier!&lt; Took me around 8-9 hours. Every single attack 1-shot me.\n\nBoss 5: &gt;! The dead deer in the same zone !&lt; This one only took around 1 hour and was by far the most satisfying fight. I died in 2-3 hits instead of 1 and I actually felt like I made progress every attempt, easily readable attack patterns. Took around 1 hour\n\nBoss 6; &gt;! Some red lady near a red church !&lt; took me around 1 hour, not sure if this counts or not since I think it was meant as a intro to people invading you\n\nIt might be obvious based on how long I took to kill certain bosses mentioned above, but I'm completely clueless to what I'm doing. Everything kills me with ease; Giant crab? 2 hits. Small rat? 5 hits. Some soldiers? 2 hits. I'm now at a castle with &gt;!Godrick the grafted!&lt; and after having died about 20 times to birds with sword-feet and soldiers, I'm having some doubts as to if I'm playing the game correctly.\n\nI've put now all my stats into Stamina and Vigor (I have 20 vigor now and about 20 stamina, level 30). I have no arts of war since I use all my runes to level. My weapon is swapped between my starting sword and the polearm dropped by &gt;!Tree Sentinel!&lt;, since I don't have attributes to equip any other weapon.\n\nMy starting class is the one with fast heal (which definitely is not very fast, gotten me killed several times).\n\nThe way I progress through each zone is typically kill everything I see. If I die I don't re-kill what I did before, but run up to my runes, collect, and keep moving by killing the new mobs I see again.\n\nI use a shield in my left hand and either my polearm or sword in my right, depending on what I'm fighting.\n\nI use a mix of block (I always hold my shield up when my stamina is full) and dodge (when I see attack animations I try to dodge instead of block).\n\nDoes anyone have any beginner tips that might help? Am I allocating my stats wrong? And I going too early to the areas I go to? I know you're supposed to die a lot, but clocking in at 19 hours for 6 named monsters and still being at the very start of the game, I feel like everything I'm doing is wrong, but man the feeling when you finally kill a boss after hours of attempts is so damn satisfying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit; Thanks for all the wonderful tips so far. A lot of pointers on where I can go to improve and general help. Wonderful community, and not at all what some youtube drama lately would make you believe!",
