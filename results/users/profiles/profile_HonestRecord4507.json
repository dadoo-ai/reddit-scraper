On paper, everything seems good, and honestly, I feel like heâ€™s the right guy for me.\n\nBut hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m struggling: Iâ€™ve never been someone who wanted marriage. Growing up and even now, Iâ€™ve seen so many failed marriages around me that I almost made it my life rule to never get married. Yet somehow, here I am. Things justâ€¦ happened, and now Iâ€™m looking back wondering how I agreed to all this so quickly.\n\nThe thought of marriage is scaring me a lot. Not just the big commitment, but also the everyday realities â€” managing household chores, balancing it with work, and being responsible for another person emotionally and practically. It feels overwhelming, and I keep asking myself: am I truly ready for this, or am I just going with the flow because everything is moving so fast?\n\nSo my question is: How do you really know if youâ€™re ready to get married?\nIs it something you just grow into, or should you already feel completely prepared before saying yes?\n\nWould love to hear from people whoâ€™ve been through this or felt the same fears.",
