(I am writing of narcissism high enough to be clinically disordered. The best I can come up with:\n\n**Agreeable** \\- Most Narcs are disagreeable. They often seem to enjoy conflict, unless they have something to gain from the person who they view as a social superior.\n\n**Neuroticism -** Covert narcs tend to be higher in neuroticism; overt narcs might be a little neurotic, but they can't show or admit it.\n\n**Introversion/Extroversion** \\- Again, Covert Narcs are often introverted while the classic grandiose type is extroverted.\n\n**Openness -** I'd say Narcs are low on openness to experience - unless it involves risky behavior. They might enjoy a fast car, or jumping out of an airplane, even risky sex. All these things trigger dopamine/adrenaline which seems to take the existential pain away for a bit.\n\n**Conscientiousness -** This breaks down into attention to commitments and grit, which is perseverance. I think they generally lack grit, but I have known narcs who are super into keeping every commitment and judging those that do not - at least superficially. I'm talking about always being on time to meetings.\n\n  \n\\----&gt; But that's it. That's what I got. It's not really possible to rate them as consistently anything in big-5 terms, except for agreeableness.

Maybe they'd be a J(udging) instead of P(ercieving) - but that's about it?\n\nI see a few potential arguments here.\n\n*1) NPD comes in all shapes and sizes.* I think that's bullstuff. It is defined as a specific type of tweak to personality.

With the NPD it might be admitting they are ever wrong or imperfect (\"the mask must stay up!\") with BPD it is a childish attempt to avoid abandonment that actually re-creates it. \n\nIf #3 is true, then the personality will change for temporary advantage in order to \"win.\" Of course, over time \"winning\" will poison the intimacy of all relationships, which are voluntary.\n\nNPD and BPD contain the seeds of relationship destruction.

I do see parallels between Amber Heard and Meghan Markle, with both of them having grandiosity, an unstable sense of self, a habit of failing to take personal responsibility while externalizing blame, relationships that blow hot/cold, making themselves a professional victim despite evidence to the contract, and so on.\n\nOn thing I noticed: That sub has RULE 1: \"No Johnny Depp Support.\" This group has rule #1 that posts must be related to MM and Prince Harry, rule 2 is no racism/sexism/bigotry.  Rule 7 here is no bodyshaming. So you can't just attack MM for having something odd about her skin, weight, etc.\n\nMany times on this sub, I have heard people say \"wait, that was too much\" or \"I think attacking her for (minor issue) is a matter of personal choice and style and it detracts from ...\" or \"... as much as I consider myself a sinner, I have to say I think (activity#1) was a good choice for her because (reasons).\"\n\nIf our group was invaded by sugars I expect there would be some pushback, but in general, people are allowed to support Harry or MM.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some odd reason I ran into an anti-Johnny-Depp sub today. I do see parallels between Amber Heard and Meghan Markle, with both of them having grandiosity, an unstable sense of self, a habit of failing to take personal responsibility while externalizing blame, relationships that blow hot/cold, making themselves a professional victim despite evidence to the contract, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On thing I noticed: That sub has RULE 1: &amp;quot;No Johnny Depp Support.&amp;quot; This group has rule #1 that posts must be related to MM and Prince Harry, rule 2 is no racism/sexism/bigotry.  Rule 7 here is no bodyshaming. So you can&amp;#39;t just attack MM for having something odd about her skin, weight, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many times on this sub, I have heard people say &amp;quot;wait, that was too much&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I think attacking her for (minor issue) is a matter of personal choice and style and it detracts from ...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;... as much as I consider myself a sinner, I have to say I think (activity#1) was a good choice for her because (reasons).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If our group was invaded by sugars I expect there would be some pushback, but in general, people are allowed to support Harry or MM.

    "body": "First, dude is clearly a secular guru who scores high on the gurometer. So I want to study him more.\n\nAfter watching SM 33 I spent four hours watching Joe Rogan #1945 while doing other things.  My goal was to understand Eric Weinstein's style of dialogue and rhetoric. Now what he says, more how he says it. \n\n**Some observations of Eric W's Rhetoric**\n\n\\- The decoders are 100% spot on when they say he builds a story around subtext. The text itself doesn't really matter, instead he will connect data points to lead the audience to a conclusion.\n\n\\- The decoders are also correct that Weinstein doesn't just want to sound smart; he seems to want to confound his audience. He uses technical jargon the same way that Star Trek uses the reverse proton field to slow down the borg - it makes the story seem credible, advances the plot, and fills in any plot holes.\n\n\\- He also uses metaphor to make his arguments. Time in two dimensions would be a whirlpool, like a record player, so you could jump. It /sounds/ compelling, but how is that any different than saying \"if you could time travel then you could time travel.\"\n\n\\- He uses subtextual cues to build a narrative that can change when he wants it to. He was brought into this project (by who?) but was not made to sign an NDA and it is always two months away but the only other\n\n\\- Most of his more out there stuff is drawn by subtext and inference. Asked \"what do you think that means?\" he will turn it around \"What do you think it means?\" I am most curious why he does this. Why not just say what you mean, Eric? My guess is that it causes the interviewer to \"buy\" the story and connect the dots, getting him credibility. If he's ever really challenged, he can say \"I didn't say that, Chris Williams said that. I presented data the he drew a conclusion from.\" So far, of the interviews I have watched, no interviewer has ever said \"I asked you first, you are the one being interviewed, tell me what you think that means.\" Though on SM 33 we did see that when pressed, Weinstein has more ways of avoiding questions. \n\n\\- He withholds information not to his advantage. It is as if, as the expression goes, he brings the cup almost to your lips, then takes it away again. No ideas ever get really ... finished. \n\n\\- He takes your question and goes where he wants to go. Just a couple minutes into the podcast, Joe asked about the rotating 180 degree wings on reported UFOs. Weinstein answers by talking about Einstein, the explosion in physics from 1953 to 1973, the stagnation of physics since, Ed Whitten and similar things. \n\n\\- His version of history is based on people. In some year on some day some person gave some speech.\n\n\\- He came up with these equations and was thrown out of Massachusetts for their impertinence then suddenly they were amazing a few years later.  The thing is, he has no STORY for how he came up with these questions. Personally, I can tell you the ROOM I was in at Frederick High School when my Physics Teacher, Mr. Wilson, taught me newton's proof of integration. Infinite boxes that are infinitely small, you divide infinity by infinity and BOOM it all works. If Weinstein came up with these equations he would have a similar story, I would think.\n\n\\- The stories don't add up and seem to be designed to draw you into conspiratorial thinking, but also they keep you wanting more.\n\nOkay, that's the rhetorical style. Did I miss anything?\n\n**Second: He kind of gives himself away**\n\nAt one point, early in Rogan #1945, Weinstein complains about ambiguity chains. That if you say you will meet me at the hotel when you come into new york, then you don't know which airport (there are 2 major commercial ones), and you don't know which hotel, and you don't know where in the hotel, etc. He complains about the government doing that. I expect that is a projection. HE is doing that, with most of his ideas having a defensible alternative-explanation for his works. (Equivocation fallacy). \n\nI seem to recall him complaining about something else that he was doing (projection), but I can't recall what it was exactly. \n\n**Next: Why not just, you know, speak plainly?**\n\nI think it's because if you actually took his 4 hour podcast and removed the nonsense (why do we need to know that einstein's 4th paper was the one that expressed the way we see the universe - without explaining it at all?) - then got rid of the inferences and just made them statements, It hink it would be more like 10 minutes. Maybe 5. It would be a fun exercise to try to do that.\n\n**Third: Why doesn't anyone call him on that?**\n\nI think he is just an entertainer. It's a little bit like ol' rush limbaugh, who, with advertisements, could make a simple idea like \"Hilary Clinton is running for Senate\" and add a thesis \"I think this is a joke, a spoiler, a trick to say she was a candidate in order to accomplish something else\" then make those two sentences last an hour (with ads). He was filling airtime.\n\nTai Lopez is famous for suggesting that NawLegh is more important than money because it leads to money and fitness and relationships and power and everything else. I suppose, in way, he's not totally wrong (I would add discipline and other things matter, but he's not wrong.) Still, it matters what you listen to.\n\nI think the value in listening to his stuff is in recognizing bullshit when it is being thrown. I do know people that do this - that draw a picture by selectively choosing facts. (By the way, IS the entire physics community afraid of ed whitten? WHY exactly? What did he ever say or do to cause this? WE DON'T KNOW.)  Listening to Eric, he is particularly good at it, mostly due to his confidence and ability to just TALK for four minutes in a row creating a yarn using metaphors that are hard to reject if you buy the metaphor. It is entirely possible that reality is not like the metaphor, that the field rejecting him is NOT like some girl in high school who is mormon who can't go out with him because he is jewish  - but once he sets up the metaphor, you are hooked, because you think and talk in terms of the metaphor. It's a trap.\n\nSo I guess he is worth studying to understand the sizzle, so you don't fall for a bad steak.\n\nStill, I noticed one more thing: All his crazier ideas involve one-on-one conversations with someone who has passed away, or is a long time ago, or cannot be replicated, or he was sworn to secrecy, etc. He just can't produce direct evidence for anything. That isn't his ... thing.\n\nI've got a degree in math. I've read large portions of geometric unity and skimmed all of it. I won't say it is nonsense, but from what I can tell, the Ship in the bottle operator literally is just an operator like + or - Or \\* or / but is never defined ever - so you can create a formula, at the SIABO, and out pops the \"right\" answer.\n\nWhew.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n ",

Married at 21 years old, so I spent more time with my spouse than I was with my own parents.  Of those years, maybe ten were something like tolerable. When the third child was born, the last bits of what I had known of as the girl I fell in love with her gone. For the next four years, she would not allow me to touch her, I could not hold her hand, if I told her I loved her she would call me a liar. Eventually I gave up being the pursuer in a pursuer/distancer drama, and that's when things REALLLY fell apart.\n\nI moved out for the first time (for 3 weeks) nine years ago. I stayed with a (male) friend, I came home at 3PM each day and stayed until 8. I asked for four things to come back home: Respect from the kids, respect from her, we see a therapist, and she involve me in the kids lives again (she homeschooled). She said she did \"not do ultimatums\", but she softened. I came back.\n\nNote: I do not blame the children. They said and did what they had to do to be safe. Mom homeschooled, I travelled for work. I could not protect them. If anything, I failed them.\n\nI realized the house was not healthy, but feared without a custody agreement, I would never see my children again. As a practical Catholic, I did not feel entitled to divorce. When I realized about legal separation - I could continue to wear my ring AND get a custody agreement - I filed within a month. That was eight years ago. I never moved out; just to the guest room. My priest talked me out of it before I got a custody agreement. He said we just had \"communication issues\", and she agreed to couples therapy, which is the big thing I wanted in first place!\n\nShe limited my access to rooms in the house, presenting me with double-binds - if I really respected her I would not come to her parents for Christmas, or would let the kids have the basement as a playroom, or would not come into her room. Or the kids room. Or the upstairs tower. Or upstairs at all. Or, eventually, she wanted me to stay in the guest room overnight so she could come down and watch TV or get a snack undisturbed.\n\nWhen I refused to abandon the public areas of the house after the kids were in bed (leaving me with no bathroom), she divorced me two weeks later and said I was an uninvolved dad. I still remember what she said to me: \"I can't believe you are MAKING me divorce you!\" I said \"What's the alternative?\" she said \"Step UP! Take Responsibility!\" I asked how she suggested I do that, and she shook her head \"If you don't know how to do to that, can't help you.\"\n\nOf course, that was code for I should divorce her, so she could be a victim. If I didn't, she'd have to divorce me, and make herself a BIGGER victim. Which she did.\n\nI haven't seen my older girls in six years. They are adults now, and the first time they were adults when I sent them a card, they told me to attempt to contact them is harassment. I have no protective orders against me, no charges, I want none, I stepped away from them when they told me this as adults.\n\nI do have the majority of the time with my youngest, partially because the court did find alienation had happened in my case. (I understand there are better psychological terms, this is what the court determined. I'd have argued authoritarian indoctrination and coercive control.) This is an incredibly high burden to prove in my state, as my state has the \"personal responsibility\" doctrine. To get to it, the other person basically has to tell on themselves on the stand.\n\nThat happened.\n\nThe court determined that her \"contempt and disdain\" for me was obvious, yet \"despite all that has been done to him, he does not seem to have retaliated in any way\", and that \"despite her claims, there is no evidence she moved 100 miles away to be with family, nor there is evidence he is a poor father. In fact, all the evidence is that he is a loving, available, fit father, and she moved away to continue to alienate the children from him.\"\n\nNone of that will bring the older girls back.\n\nThe divorce was final five years ago. The Catholic annullment was processed three years ago. She remarried last year.\n\nI'm in a weekly zoom support group for parents who have lost children to narcissistic abuse and splitting. It helps. Been in it for almost 5 years now.\n\nI've read the books. Psychopath Free, Whole Again, a whole pile of abuse recovery books. I've been moving forward. Most of the time, I don't wallow in grief. \n\nand yet.\n\nI still love her.\n\nNot in the crazy, eros, sexy romantic way. More in something like a brotherly or parent-ly way. And I know it has to be from afar; any contact over anything but logistics for our youngest is to be accused of stalking. I just wish the best for her. I made a promise in a Church, in front of God and Witnesses, and that wishing the best for her is all that remains of it.\n\nThis morning, I was reminded of the Tim McGraw song \"Just to see you smile.\" I found myself listening to it on repeat.\n\nThis cannot be healthy for me.\n\nTips and tricks for recovery?\n\nGo lift weights? Exercise? Serve others? Massive shot of B12?\n\nTalk to me goose.\n\nHelp me get out of here, please.\n\nI've been in this hole before. It's time to get out.",

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were married, on paper, for twenty-two years. Longer than I lived with my parents and went to college. Of those years, maybe ten were something like tolerable. When the third child was born, the last bits of what I had known of as the girl I fell in love with her gone. For the next four years, she would not allow me to touch her, I could not hold her hand, if I told her I loved her she would call me a liar. Eventually I gave up being the pursuer in a pursuer/distancer drama, and that&amp;#39;s when things REALLLY fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved out for the first time (for 3 weeks) nine years ago. I stayed with a (male) friend, I came home at 3PM each day and stayed until 8. I asked for four things to come back home: Respect from the kids, respect from her, we see a therapist, and she involve me in the kids lives again (she homeschooled). She said she did &amp;quot;not do ultimatums&amp;quot;, but she softened. I came back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized the house was not healthy, but feared without a custody agreement, I would never see my children again. As a practical Catholic, I did not feel entitled to divorce. When I realized about legal separation - I could continue to wear my ring AND get a custody agreement - I filed within a month. That was eight years ago. I never moved out; just to the guest room. My priest talked me out of it before I got a custody agreement. He said we just had &amp;quot;communication issues&amp;quot;, and she agreed to couples therapy, which is the big thing I wanted in first place!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She limited my access to rooms in the house, presenting me with double-binds - if I really respected her I would not come to her parents for Christmas, or would let the kids have the basement as a playroom, or would not come into her room. Or the kids room. Or the upstairs tower. Or upstairs at all. Or, eventually, she wanted me to stay in the guest room overnight so she could come down and watch TV or get a snack undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I refused to abandon the public areas of the house after the kids were in bed (leaving me with no bathroom), she divorced me two weeks later and said I was an uninvolved dad.  I still remember what she said to me: &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe you are MAKING me divorce you!&amp;quot; I said &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the alternative?&amp;quot; she said &amp;quot;Step UP! Take Responsibility!&amp;quot; I asked how she suggested I do that, and she shook her head &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t know how to do to that, can&amp;#39;t help you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, that was code for I should divorce her, so she could be a victim. If I didn&amp;#39;t, she&amp;#39;d have to divorce me, and make herself a BIGGER victim. Which she did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen my older girls in six years. They are adults now, and the first time they were adults when I sent them a card, they told me to attempt to contact them is harassment. I have no protective orders against me, no charges, I want none, I stepped away from them when they told me this as adults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do have the majority of the time with my youngest, partially because the court did find alienation had happened in my case. (I understand there are better psychological terms, this is what the court determined. I&amp;#39;d have argued authoritarian indoctrination and coercive control.) This is an incredibly high burden to prove in my state, as my state has the &amp;quot;personal responsibility&amp;quot; doctrine. To get to it, the other person basically has to tell on themselves on the stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The court determined that her &amp;quot;contempt and disdain&amp;quot; for me was obvious, yet &amp;quot;despite all that has been done to him, he does not seem to have retaliated in any way&amp;quot;, and that &amp;quot;despite her claims, there is no evidence she moved 100 miles away to be with family, nor there is evidence he is a poor father. In fact, all the evidence is that he is a loving, available, fit father, and she moved away to continue to alienate the children from him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of that will bring the older girls back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The divorce was final five years ago. The Catholic annullment was processed three years ago. She remarried last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in a weekly zoom support group for parents who have lost children to narcissistic abuse and splitting. It helps.

Still ... seems important. If we can find a way for professors to be better compensated, they will have more time/energy/work-life balance to grade, better profs will stick around longers, etc. Better experience for students; everyone wins!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I can&amp;#39;t see what you did, all I have is grades. Cutting and pasting &amp;quot;Great work!&amp;quot; for A&amp;#39;s and &amp;quot;Good work!&amp;quot; for B&amp;#39;s etc seems silly. I asked my evaluator  - I suppose it would be possible to notice grades-over-time and offer encouragement if they are improving or empathy/support if they are slipping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have zybooks, do your professors give you feedback on your scores?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems really odd to me. This is my ?? 4th ?? evaluated class and the first time I am hearing of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also - don&amp;#39;t worry, I am a prospective student too. Looking into a Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counselling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Audio:  \n[https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2025-03-08-marc-benioff-on-agentic-ai-and-next/](https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2025-03-08-marc-benioff-on-agentic-ai-and-next/)\n\nIf you prefer there is video too:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WQv6t2gPkg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WQv6t2gPkg)\n\nHe used a lot of words and sounded really bombastic, but when you boil it down to symbolic logic, he really didn't say much. AgentForce is going to be better than CoPilots because it is \"integrated accross the enterprise\" that is \"already on saleforce\" so you can \"just turn it on\" ... but what does it DO? Something about having a wide shoe?\n\nSeriously, from what I can tell, AgentForce is used by Vans as a customer support chatbot. It is /implied/ that the chatbot can do things like look up your previous orders and read them back to you, cancel your order, find things and order them for you, etc, like a personalized shopper might.\n\nActually, no, that's bullshit, I just went to [vans.com](http://vans.com) and clicked on AI help and asked how to cancel an order and it said:\n\n\"I'm sorry, I cannot place orders using product IDs.  I am a shopping assistant and my capabilities are limited to answering your questions about Vans products and services.\"\n\nSo I asked it if it could look up my old orders. And it said:\n\n\"I'm sorry, I don't have access to your order history.  To look up your old orders, you'll need to visit the Vans website and log into your account.  There should be an order history section where you can view details of your past purchases.\"\n\nSo I logged in and asked again. And it said:\n\n\"Excellent!  Since I cannot access external websites or personal information, I can't help you directly with viewing your order history.  However, the Vans website should have a clear section for viewing past orders, usually found under \"My Account\" or a similar heading.  Look for options like \"Order History\" or \"Past Orders.\"  If you're having trouble finding it, you can also try contacting Vans customer service for assistance.\"\n\nSo I asked it this:\n\n&gt;*Wait. You tell me that you cannot access external websites to lookup my orders, but I am logged in to vans.com right now. Vans.com is not external to you, you are vans.com. In fact marc Benioff, CEO of salesforce, recently publicly said that you were deeply integrated with the vans website. So you can't you tell me my order history?*\n\nAnd it responded:\n\n*I understand your frustration.  While I don't have access to individual order histories, I apologize for the inconvenience you're experiencing.  To access your order information, please try logging into your* [*Vans.com*](http://Vans.com) *account directly and navigating to your order history section.  If you continue to have trouble, I recommend contacting Vans customer support directly through their website for assistance. They will be able to help you access your order details.*\n\n\\----&gt; So it's a chatbot that ingested a product catalog and can help you find sneakers.\n\nDid I get that right?\n\nIf you really want to be entertained, check out Salesforce's own guide to using agentForce, which I took as \"we don't know how to use it; maybe you got some ideas?\"\n\n[https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentforce-use-case/](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentforce-use-case/)\n\nDoes anyone have any actual tangible use cases for AgentForce where it actually acts like a real agent, taking data from one source system, coming to conclusions, and /doing/ something with the data into another system of record?

    "body": "I heard an old saw once that once you have to add \"...science\" to the end of a discipline, it is a sure sign of non-scientific indoctrination. For example, to pick on myself, Computer Science isn't really repeatable experiment, it isn't really discovery, it's programming according to the model of how we build computers today. (If you want something to google search on this look up the \"Von Neumann architecture\").  Similar criticisms could be made of political science - \"social science\" has at least a little more rigor. (This famous comic may apply - [https://misciwriters.com/2016/07/12/science-behind-the-scenes-which-fields-are-real-sciences/](https://misciwriters.com/2016/07/12/science-behind-the-scenes-which-fields-are-real-sciences/) )\n\nI've come to realize recently just how disappointed I've become with Neuroscience. I expect to hear about neurons and neural nets and electrodes, but whenever I see something touted as \"Neuroscience\" it invariably is a *model* that seeks to define behavior tied to incentives. Carol Dweck, for instance, has suggested the growth vs. fixed mindset, which boils down to it is better to think you can improve than in assuming you know everything than if you don't. That's fine, but it's a model, it's not really \"brain science.\" Kahneman's \"Thinking fast or slow\" proposed a different model, system one and system two, for how we make decisions. Again, fine, as far as it goes, but it isn't really studying the brain. Kaheman also repeated priming studies as if they were fact, when they couldn't be replicated. ( [https://replicationindex.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/](https://replicationindex.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/) )\n\nI suppose Kahneman and Dweck do not claim to be neuroscientists, they'd say they are psychologists. My point today is that when people start telling these stories as if they are \"neuroscience\" or \"fact\", they are reasonably highly correlated with being bullshit. If they were true, we'd be using a different term, like \"neurologist\" or \"biologist.\"\n\nWhich brings me to Guru-ness.\n\nI recently saw a list of \"best podcasts to listen to this year\" and one of them was Huberman's interview with Martha Beck:\n\n[https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-martha-beck-accessing-your-best-self-with-mind-body-practices-belief-testing-imagination](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-martha-beck-accessing-your-best-self-with-mind-body-practices-belief-testing-imagination)\n\nAfter trying to listen, a few things struck me with mentioning.\n\nI tried listened to it for about an hour and a half. For some reason I found it painful.\n\nFirst of all, it's just a weird conversation. It seems like the two are cross-talking. Perhaps Huberman is trying to bring her into his frame. Meanwhile, Beck is trying to bring him into hers, which would require some vulnerability. And he is not having it.\n\nThe second thing, which is the purpose of this post, is the combination of good, objective science, is combined with unverifiable pseudo-scientific bullshit. It is combination of authority (this is \"the way\") with \"here are some things I have found to be helpful.\"\n\nI started tuning out when they started talking about energy rays and telepathy. \n\nIt just struck me as so false. It reminded me of this (long) post on Psuedo-science I had just read \\~15 minutes prior (summary: People earn real medical credentials so they can cloak woo woo unverifiable stuff in a shroud of credibility ):  [https://www.facebook.com/bodyforwife/posts/pfbid0QybrypLrzsMbr5j6MYFaRgcxAFTz9kTnRuQeSnkjZBSMaDwqRhQ6p3RRq2BhMiBEl](https://www.facebook.com/bodyforwife/posts/pfbid0QybrypLrzsMbr5j6MYFaRgcxAFTz9kTnRuQeSnkjZBSMaDwqRhQ6p3RRq2BhMiBEl)\n\nMy question: When people start talking about Neuroscience, should our BS detectors go off?\n\nAlso, re:Narcissism, I am reminded of this tweet:\n\n[https://x.com/hubermanlab/status/1702351659609833875](https://x.com/hubermanlab/status/1702351659609833875)\n\n\"That didn't feel good.

    "body": "I'm in the middle of reading Eyes Wide Open by Raphael, the screenwriter on Eyes Wide Shut. It was published in 1999, meaning the movie came out, Kubrick was dead, and Raphael dashed it out quickly to capitalize on the moment.\n\nThere is a thread on the Kubrick subreddit here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/192l52w/eyes\\_wide\\_open\\_by\\_frederic\\_raphael/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/192l52w/eyes_wide_open_by_frederic_raphael/)\n\nKatharina Kubrick, who had a role in the art department on EWS, commented on the thread, to summarize: She thought the book was a hack job and insulting.\n\nYes, as I read it, Raphael really wants to understand the conflict between writer and director, and his personal sense of conflict with directors. It really does come through on the page. The various little snubs are obvious. I am about half-way in, and he has managed to tell kubrick twice that *those who can, do* and *those who can't seek to control those who can*. (This includes the comment about the last dying elements of imperium are impotent envy of those that can, or something like that.) He also did the whole \"I can do my art with a piece of paper and a pen but you need a film crew and a million dollars\", and implies his work is art and kubrick's might not be. Plus he has to tell us a bunch of micro-stories about myth and the classics, which would be AWESOME if it weren't a transparent attempt to tell us how smart he is. For example, there is this \"sword in the bed\" narrative and the bluebeard legend. Then there is the reference to Penelope's shroud, which I found super obtuse (he calls it something other than a shroud, so my google searching failed). and his work as Sisyphus, the Gallic war, Cicero, Julius Caesar, the Gaul general caesar surrendered to. I'm surprised there is less reference to Freud as the original work is so Freudian.\n\nBut most importantly, beyond that, was the weird way in which Kubrick could not say what he wanted, leaving Raphael to draft and Kubrick to revise. Personally, I think it is due to Kubrick [cutting the movie as two movies, perfectly timed to be played together](https://medium.com/@mheusser/eyes-wide-shut-kubrick-s-great-mystery-part-i-aceafcca3bbd), but I'm going to read on.\n\nHas anyone else read the book?

It does not look, to me, like a woman&amp;#39;s sanitary device, and the placement would be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could just be some way of running the wire for the mic, but that seems odd, unnecessary, sloppy for Kubrick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "First of all, I think Kubrick was very much as \"you take away from it what you take away from it\" kind guy. It may be that the \"was that part a dream or not--?\" question is intentional, that he doesn't have an answer.\n\nThat said, I think the movie is superficially boring BECAUSE he was so busy injecting symbolism and meaning into it. So if you put him against a wall and stuck your finger in his face and signed an NDA and maybe got him a little tipsy, what would he say was happening? Here's my take:\n\n1. The Christmas tree LIGHTS are a symbol of arousal or desire. When you see them on, someone is \"turned on\"; when they are absent or turned off, the environment is neutral or sterile. Thus at the end when you see a little bit of Christmas tree lights, it symbolizes the rekindling of their desire.\n\n**2) I think the second party is a dream.** The wife tells Bills she had a dream about an Orgy, they smoke pot, everything gets weird and surreal. From there until he finds the mask on the bed he is high as a kite. This allows for continuity errors ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/mysu40/the\\_continuity\\_error\\_in\\_eyes\\_wide\\_shut/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/mysu40/the_continuity_error_in_eyes_wide_shut/) ) establishing shots that indicate no time has passed at all (I can't find a reference, maybe someone else can). It also allows him to come home at 4AM and go to work the next day no problem.\n\n3) This means that when he sees the mask and breaks down crying to his wife that he will tell all, *\"all\" is him flirting with the daughter of the doctor, him flirting with the prostitute, etc ... not lying to sneak out to a sex party*. It is mostly admitting his thought-crimes, which the book plays with the Christian idea that if you've thought it in your heart you've committed the sin. (I am a confessing Christian and can see this as true from certain directions. I struggle with it.) He also tells her about the dream, another thought-crime or five. At the end of the movie, the wife says they should be happy they \"survived\" it and wants to move on. If the events were literal, that'd be weird - like we are lucky Red Cloak didn't take us out? If, however, she means *we are lucky the relationship survived (our fantasies and flirtations)*, well, that just makes total sense.\n\n4) It makes zero sense that, if the baddies were real, they would give her his mask and say \"ask him about this!\" That is because, of course, the baddies, the second party, and the mask, were a dream. (Or else she's a beta slave herself. #6 explores why I do not think that is the case. ANOTHER explanation is that he came home after the party, put his stuff away, and left/forgot the mask, which she discovered and put at his bed. This seems possible, in which case it would not be a dream and still she is no slave. Assuming Party #2 was real, DID he go home with the stuff, then take it back later?)\n\n5) The mirroring indicates a dream. Party 2 mirrors party 1, Victor's red pool table, cue ball, and chalk mirrors red cloak, when Bill meets the daughter of his dying patient, she is a look alike for Nicole Kidman, and her husband a look-a-like for Tom Cruise. This is a chance for him to be with someone-else who is not him. Arguably the pick-up-costume scene mirrors the drop off scene, and the try-to-hit-on-hooker scene mirrors the find-out-she-is-hiv-positive scene. I am least confident of this point.\n\n6) Alice is not some evil beta sex slave leader. She is, however, kind-of trapped in a marriage that allows her an easy life where she doesn't have to do too much but raise a child (with $$ for help), look pretty, and be available for her man, who she has grown to resent. Societal pressure kind-of forces her to stay. In other words, she is kind-of a sex slave, of a sort, which her daughter is in danger of becoming.\n\n7) The weird things (backdrops with loops like the number 6, the word SEX on a painting above the child's bed, lights kinda shaped like boobs, all the christmas-wreath-like decorations that look kind-of like crosses but not quite, the strategically placed painting in the elevator) are all indicators of the unconscious manifesting into the conscious.\n\n8) There's weird pedo implications in the movie, with both the daughter and the costume daughter. I doesn't really fit the narrative of \"all about bill\"; in fact, Bill is pissed when he comes back and the men have (apparently) bought their way into everything being okay. I'm not quite sure what to say about that, except that Epstein was only about two degrees of separation away. UPDATE: I think this comment explains it well. At least, I think it is very likely - it's more social commentary on how we are metaphorically abducted by a broken social system in childhood. (Consumerism and falling into social roles etc). This is the best explanation for #8 I've got.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/18rdftx/comment/kf6bsi8/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\_term=1&amp;utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/18rdftx/comment/kf6bsi8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n**The big reveal here is #2 / #3,** but what strikes me is how real the \"post-second-party\" scenes are. The victor pool scene is particularly realistic, there is a detailed newspaper article, etc. My only guesses to this is the girl really did die after the /first/ party, Bill went and talked to Victor, and the red pool table, tapping of pool cue and chaulk inspired the dream. Bill fever state takes the conversation about the girl dying after the first party and creates the second party. That still doesn't explain the attempt to find Nick Nightengale - but with a name like Nick Nightengale, my guess is the dude wasn't real anyway. My second explanation for the events post-second-party that seem too real is \"\\_shrug\\_. It's a movie, Kubrick wanted to be true to the book. Plus having these be a little 'too' realistic to be a dream misleads the audience, who in a theatre is going to just take it at face value.\"\n\nAnyway, that's my take. It has some holes in it, but I am developing some confidence in it.\n\nTell me how I am wrong.\n\n**UPDATE:** Does anyone have any insight on the color scheme? I mean, it's blue, red, and green.

    "body": "Yesterday I posted this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/1d9y0lc/my\\_take\\_on\\_the\\_meaning\\_of\\_eyes\\_wide\\_shut/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/1d9y0lc/my_take_on_the_meaning_of_eyes_wide_shut/)\n\nAnd I have a more defined take. There's an interpretation offered and a surprise at the end.\n\nTo sum it up: Eyes Wide Shut is *adult fantasy*.\n\nIn Disney's Cinderella, the little cinder girl talks to the birds and the mice. We don't ask if that was real, or ask if it was a dream, or it it was her imagination, or posit that it was a projection her unconscious such that it felt \"real to her.\" No. We take Cinderella as a story about a girl who is so virtuous that animals befriend her, and her virtue is rewarded by her Godmother and seen by the prince. It has a bunch of crazy fantasy elements that could never happen, but hey man, it's a movie, and rollicking good story.\n\nYou can see where I'm going here, and might say \"Oh no man, but Eyes Wide Shut is REAL!!!\"\n\nIs it?\n\nThe movie is based on the book Traumnovelle, which translates as \"Dream Story\", and is intentionally designed to be the intersection of fantasy and reality - to blend the two. The author was Austrian in the 1920's, and knew Freud's work intimately. One more timely and relevant comparison to Tramnovelle is \"A little princess\", a 1905 victorian-style virtue novel about a little girl who is sent to boarding school, dad disappears, and she is mistreated as a scullery maid yet her virtue causes her to rise. While the girl is living in the attic, there are various vermin who would scare or hurt her, but, due to her virtue, she befriends them. Now, does this really happen? Were the rats-as-friends in the novel real? Who cares man, it's a novel, the rats befriending her shows her virtue, which is the point.\n\n**Back to EWS**\n\nLikewise, Eyes Wide Shut starts out about a man sleepwalking through life, not paying attention to his family. In the course of the movie he is awakened to the idea that his wife's attentions are not permanent and fixed and irreversible, that his own desire can be animalistic, yet have consequences such as jealousy, pregnancy, and disease. It also indicates that at the top of capitalism, when you think you can buy anything, and treat people like things, you lose more than a little bit of your humanity. It has elements of sex, but that is fine, it is an *adult fantasy*. As an adult fantasy, it is not a fairy tale; the actions of the characters have consequences and everything does not get easy wrap at the end of the show. By the end he has a chance to start something new of more depth with his wife that might please both of them a little more. That's mostly it.\n\nIs the second party real? \"Hey man, it's a movie, it's a fantasy, stop worrying about if the birds in cinderella are aligned with the fairy godmother\" is a perfectly reasonable response.\n\nThe works especially well with the surreal quality of Kubrick's movies - the movie is part real, part fantasy, and that's okay.\n\nIn Freudian or Jungian terms, the fantasy is Bill's unconscious coming aware to his conscious. Is the cult real? In a sense, \"hey man, it's a movie, it doesn't matter, the story is told as if it were.\" (In another sense, none of this is real, it's a movie. Don't worry about it too much.)\n\nIs Alice a beta love slave? Certainly not, except to the extent that she resents her sex-partner, who provides for all her material and financial needs, and feels trapped in the relationship, and is likely to teach her daughter to become the same. So ... sorta?\n\nThat's mostly a wrap. The movie is what I wrote in the first paragraph under \"back to EWS\", and there's plenty to be found in that.\n\nBut I personally found a lesson in the movie beyond it. You might disagree, but I'd like to talk about it.\n\nSpoiler, I'm going to get religious for a minute.\n\n**Religion in EWS**\n\nOne interesting element in EWS is the lack of religious imagery. The Christmas decorations are Pagan, there are no mangers, no wise men, no crosses, no one ever walks past a church, etc. The closest thing to \"religion\" is probably red cloak, and I think if anything they are mocking traditional religion and worshipping animalistic desire.\n\nOthers have point out that this restricts Bills choices. He cannot simply fall back on virtue because it is what his priest says. The option of some external authority telling him what is right, then, is taken from him. According to Campbell, his three options would be limited to two: Either become a passive victim or figure it out for himself. (Perhaps, he could try to put the genie back in the bottle and return to his naive world pre-wake-up. Good luck with that.)\n\nI think this is what Kubrick was going for, influenced by his reality as an athiest with jewist heritage. He had to figure it out for himself; so will Bill, so may the viewer.\n\n... and yet ...\n\nAt the end of the second party, someone Bill hardly knows offers to sacrifice herself in his place. Taking the film on it's surface, the best guess is she thought \"I'm a drug addicted h\\*\\*ker, I knew what I was doing, I made choices, Bill's just a doctor who wants to help people that got here out of curiosity and dumb luck. If I die and he lives, he will save people. If he dies and I live, I'll probably overdose next week  -- and my life ain't that great anyway.\"\n\nThat is a satisfying answer. but still ... who does that?\n\nWhat is vicarious, sacrificial redemption doing in the middle of a bizzare black-mass orgy scene in a surreal fantasy movie by an athiest?\n\nWhere else does that appear in literature?\n\nWell, the bible, for one.\n\n&gt;\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\" - John 15:13\n\n&gt;\"There is *no* greater *love than* this—that a man should *lay down his life* for his *friends*.\" (Romans 5:8)\n\nSomehow, in the midst of all this, Christ finds a way to appear.\n\nYou're free to disagree and take something else from this movie. If you are not convinced but would listen to another example, consider \"the princess bride\", another movie made by a sincere nonreligious Jew seeking truth and virtue. Watch it with a intellectual who knows the Christian faith, and ask about it. Somehow, a type of Christ finds a way to be present in the story.\n\nYou're free to tell me the scapegoat story is universal and this is the collective unconscious manifesting it's head again, and that's fine, as far as it goes. Rene Girard's \"I saw Satan fall like lightning\" does a rigorous job rejecting the idea. (Or you can just tell me judaism has some similar themes eg Isaac and Abraham; that is a better argument.)\n\nI don't know how to close this out. It meant something to me. I hope sharing it means something to you.\n\nChrist finds a way.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/1d9y0lc/my_take_on_the_meaning_of_eyes_wide_shut/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/1d9y0lc/my_take_on_the_meaning_of_eyes_wide_shut/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I have a more defined take. There&amp;#39;s an interpretation offered and a surprise at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To sum it up: Eyes Wide Shut is &lt;em&gt;adult fantasy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Disney&amp;#39;s Cinderella, the little cinder girl talks to the birds and the mice. We don&amp;#39;t ask if that was real, or ask if it was a dream, or it it was her imagination, or posit that it was a projection her unconscious such that it felt &amp;quot;real to her.&amp;quot; No. We take Cinderella as a story about a girl who is so virtuous that animals befriend her, and her virtue is rewarded by her Godmother and seen by the prince. It has a bunch of crazy fantasy elements that could never happen, but hey man, it&amp;#39;s a movie, and rollicking good story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see where I&amp;#39;m going here, and might say &amp;quot;Oh no man, but Eyes Wide Shut is REAL!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movie is based on the book Traumnovelle, which translates as &amp;quot;Dream Story&amp;quot;, and is intentionally designed to be the intersection of fantasy and reality - to blend the two. The author was Austrian in the 1920&amp;#39;s, and knew Freud&amp;#39;s work intimately. One more timely and relevant comparison to Tramnovelle is &amp;quot;A little princess&amp;quot;, a 1905 victorian-style virtue novel about a little girl who is sent to boarding school, dad disappears, and she is mistreated as a scullery maid yet her virtue causes her to rise. While the girl is living in the attic, there are various vermin who would scare or hurt her, but, due to her virtue, she befriends them. Now, does this really happen? Were the rats-as-friends in the novel real? Who cares man, it&amp;#39;s a novel, the rats befriending her shows her virtue, which is the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to EWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Eyes Wide Shut starts out about a man sleepwalking through life, not paying attention to his family. In the course of the movie he is awakened to the idea that his wife&amp;#39;s attentions are not permanent and fixed and irreversible, that his own desire can be animalistic, yet have consequences such as jealousy, pregnancy, and disease. It also indicates that at the top of capitalism, when you think you can buy anything, and treat people like things, you lose more than a little bit of your humanity. It has elements of sex, but that is fine, it is an &lt;em&gt;adult fantasy&lt;/em&gt;. As an adult fantasy, it is not a fairy tale; the actions of the characters have consequences and everything does not get easy wrap at the end of the show. By the end he has a chance to start something new of more depth with his wife that might please both of them a little more. That&amp;#39;s mostly it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the second party real? &amp;quot;Hey man, it&amp;#39;s a movie, it&amp;#39;s a fantasy, stop worrying about if the birds in cinderella are aligned with the fairy godmother&amp;quot; is a perfectly reasonable response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The works especially well with the surreal quality of Kubrick&amp;#39;s movies - the movie is part real, part fantasy, and that&amp;#39;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Freudian or Jungian terms, the fantasy is Bill&amp;#39;s unconscious coming aware to his conscious. Is the cult real? In a sense, &amp;quot;hey man, it&amp;#39;s a movie, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, the story is told as if it were.&amp;quot; (In another sense, none of this is real, it&amp;#39;s a movie. Don&amp;#39;t worry about it too much.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is Alice a beta love slave? Certainly not, except to the extent that she resents her sex-partner, who provides for all her material and financial needs, and feels trapped in the relationship, and is likely to teach her daughter to become the same. So ... sorta?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s mostly a wrap. The movie is what I wrote in the first paragraph under &amp;quot;back to EWS&amp;quot;, and there&amp;#39;s plenty to be found in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I personally found a lesson in the movie beyond it. You might disagree, but I&amp;#39;d like to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spoiler, I&amp;#39;m going to get religious for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion in EWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One interesting element in EWS is the lack of religious imagery. The Christmas decorations are Pagan, there are no mangers, no wise men, no crosses, no one ever walks past a church, etc. The closest thing to &amp;quot;religion&amp;quot; is probably red cloak, and I think if anything they are mocking traditional religion and worshipping animalistic desire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others have point out that this restricts Bills choices. He cannot simply fall back on virtue because it is what his priest says. The option of some external authority telling him what is right, then, is taken from him. According to Campbell, his three options would be limited to two: Either become a passive victim or figure it out for himself. (Perhaps, he could try to put the genie back in the bottle and return to his naive world pre-wake-up. Good luck with that.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this is what Kubrick was going for, influenced by his reality as an athiest with jewist heritage. He had to figure it out for himself; so will Bill, so may the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... and yet ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the second party, someone Bill hardly knows offers to sacrifice herself in his place. Taking the film on it&amp;#39;s surface, the best guess is she thought &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a drug addicted h**ker, I knew what I was doing, I made choices, Bill&amp;#39;s just a doctor who wants to help people that got here out of curiosity and dumb luck. If I die and he lives, he will save people. If he dies and I live, I&amp;#39;ll probably overdose next week  -- and my life ain&amp;#39;t that great anyway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is a satisfying answer. but still ... who does that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is vicarious, sacrificial redemption doing in the middle of a bizzare black-mass orgy scene in a surreal fantasy movie by an athiest?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where else does that appear in literature?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, the bible, for one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&amp;quot; - John 15:13&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; greater &lt;em&gt;love than&lt;/em&gt; this—that a man should &lt;em&gt;lay down his life&lt;/em&gt; for his &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; (Romans 5:8)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow, in the midst of all this, Christ finds a way to appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re free to disagree and take something else from this movie.

    "body": "***Imagine this scenario ...***\n\nYou have a difficult marriage. Under the advice of a therapist, you start establishing boundaries. The boundaries look like: I will not be insulted. IF you insult me, I'll leave the room. If you follow and insult me, I'll leave the house. If you insult me on my return, I'll be gone longer.  Of course, I'd like us to get along and have an effective relationship. I'm open to conversations about how I could do better that are specific. But \"You did a terrible job raking the leaves, the kids could do better in half the time, never rake leaves again, the yard looks terrible\" is not constructive - especially when it is every area of my operations within the home. (I once asked \"what do you want from me? Go nowhere? Do nothing? Be No one?\" and she replied \"yes.\")\n\nIf you follow this to its natural conclusion, the person either changes their behavior or the marriage has to end, as someone is living elsewhere. I file for legal separation but don't move out without a custody order; our priest talks me out of it. When she realizes her reputation is in the community is at risk, I think she decides the marriages needs to end so she can be a victim. (because I told relevant church leaders about my choices, etc - I had to, I was nominated for president of men's group and filing for separation). \n\nShe spends six months acting badly in order to get me to divorce her (that I know, my supposition is this was so she could be a victim), when I don't she divorces me and we see the \"he is the abuser\" narrative.\n\nExcept people don't believe her.\n\nShe's been harsh, difficult, contemptuous, uninterested in relationship with so many people in the community for so long. She'd stare daggers at me after church to get me to not talk to people, and I'd followed her home. After isolating me in the home, even from my own children (I was a wimp and she homeschooled) she told people in the church that I was a narcissist and sociopath. When they asked what it was I did, how she came to that conclusion, she had no words to answer them, aside from \"if you like him so much you can invite him to live with you.\" That is what she told one set of friends that offered to let her live with them when she said I was abusive. She choose instead to live in the house until her financial support was guaranteed by law.\n\nMost of the previous paragraph came out in court, and the findings were consistent with it. It did take two years, and by then the older children never wanted to see me again. I got a custody reversal for the youngest.\n\nSince then, from what I can tell, she's had a somewhat parasitic lifestyle, mostly living off my support. As the older kids aged out, that amount has gone down. I now get a pittance for the youngest and pay her 12X that much in spousal support, but even that will end in a few years. If she earns more monet then, she'll have to pay me more child support. \n\nNOW ...\n\nOne thing I've noticed about this person is their ability to *remember things differently* for their short-term advantage.\n\nIt makes me wonder: When the support money runs out, if she can't find someone to glom onto, what are the odds she'll come back around, saying it would be best if the youngest had two parents, she misses me, etc.\n\nI've done a pro and con list that she'd be interested in a relationship.\n\n**Make it unlikely:**\n\n* *Perceived loss of face in the community.* Early in the process she moved as far as legally allowed away (100 miles ish). I'm convinced one of the reasons was because she felt judged and disbelieved by the community. Coming back would be worse in two ways, because the people that believed her in the first place would be like \"what the hell?\"\n* *Narcissistic Injury.* My \"betrayal\" by filing for legal separation - even though I resolved to continue to wear my ring and honor my oath of fidelity - that really shook her. I don't think she thought I was capable of that. To put it in words she might think: She couldn't trust anyone, and even this little wimpy loser guy was capable of hurting her!\n* *She'd be afraid of being rejected.* Her entire communication strategy seemed to involve avoiding vulnerability. Thus instead of saying \"Please pass the salt\", where I could say no and she would be hurt, she would have to say \"You never pass the da\\*n salt, you jerk.\" Then if I pass the salt she gets what she wants, but if not, she didn't have to be vulnerable. This had a corrosive effect on the relationship.\n* *Splitting.* I'm the devil. Some truamatic event would have to happen that would cause her to rethink her entire life orientation. This did happen, once like a midlife crisis, and once at a homeschooling retreat I did not go to when she got a hotel room. She came back and was kind to me. It lasted two weeks until she said she couldn't do it, I was too much of an idiot, and she went back to her old ways. The first one was a childbirth, and it was a negative change that made the relationship change from bad to intolerable. I thought it was post-partum depression for the next two years, but it just never ended. \n* *Requires vulnerability.* She'd have to risk rejection.\n\n**Make it more likely:**\n\n* *Money.* She really hasn't put any effort in to provide for herself that I'm aware of. \n* *Easy to plan.* I'm getting to the edge of consensus, but one of the qualities of NPD/BPD is the lack of long-term planning portions of executive function, due to malformed pre frontal cortex. She went to college, like people her age did, and was smart enough to get into a good one, but got a liberal arts degree with no clear path to a career. From what i can tell, in the years since leaving, she hasn't really stuck through with any personal development plan to accomplish anything, no college at night, etc. My support for several years was enough that should could have gone to school at night to pursue something. For the past several years she's had the work-week free during the school year, and before that she had baby-sitters living in the house.\n* *The ability to change memories.* Awhile back I was working in the attic and found an old love letter delivered to me on our 10 year anniversary. I don't think it was though; I don't think she delivered it. The whole thing was incredibly sticky-sweet, about how she loved me, we were perfect to each other and things were so great and even when they seemed hard they were really great. THIS IS SO WEIRD, because when things were not great they *suuuuuucked.* Yet in the annullment paperwork, she said she never loved me and that she thought I was her only chance at getting married.\n\nBasically, I'm wondering if, given the scenarios above, it is possible that she would decide to try and restart relations. Honestly I'd love a better co-parenting relationship, and could use even a minor romantic relationship to reconnect with the older children. Plus I've learned the boundaries skills to stay safe/sane.\n\nOffhand, I think the inability to be vulnerable would clinch it. She's trapped herself.\n\nAnd yes, before you say, it's obvious to me I still have some attachment issues to work through - like - why think about this? Why type ALL THIS UP about something that is extremely unlikely to happen, and if it does the right answer is to peace out? Clearly I have more work to do on myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

After isolating me in the home, even from my own children (I was a wimp and she homeschooled) she told people in the church that I was a narcissist and sociopath. When they asked what it was I did, how she came to that conclusion, she had no words to answer them, aside from &amp;quot;if you like him so much you can invite him to live with you.&amp;quot; That is what she told one set of friends that offered to let her live with them when she said I was abusive. She choose instead to live in the house until her financial support was guaranteed by law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the previous paragraph came out in court, and the findings were consistent with it. It did take two years, and by then the older children never wanted to see me again. I got a custody reversal for the youngest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, from what I can tell, she&amp;#39;s had a somewhat parasitic lifestyle, mostly living off my support. As the older kids aged out, that amount has gone down. I now get a pittance for the youngest and pay her 12X that much in spousal support, but even that will end in a few years. If she earns more monet then, she&amp;#39;ll have to pay me more child support. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOW ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;#39;ve noticed about this person is their ability to &lt;em&gt;remember things differently&lt;/em&gt; for their short-term advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder: When the support money runs out, if she can&amp;#39;t find someone to glom onto, what are the odds she&amp;#39;ll come back around, saying it would be best if the youngest had two parents, she misses me, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done a pro and con list that she&amp;#39;d be interested in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it unlikely:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perceived loss of face in the community.&lt;/em&gt; Early in the process she moved as far as legally allowed away (100 miles ish). I&amp;#39;m convinced one of the reasons was because she felt judged and disbelieved by the community. Coming back would be worse in two ways, because the people that believed her in the first place would be like &amp;quot;what the hell?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narcissistic Injury.&lt;/em&gt; My &amp;quot;betrayal&amp;quot; by filing for legal separation - even though I resolved to continue to wear my ring and honor my oath of fidelity - that really shook her. I don&amp;#39;t think she thought I was capable of that. To put it in words she might think: She couldn&amp;#39;t trust anyone, and even this little wimpy loser guy was capable of hurting her!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;d be afraid of being rejected.&lt;/em&gt; Her entire communication strategy seemed to involve avoiding vulnerability. Thus instead of saying &amp;quot;Please pass the salt&amp;quot;, where I could say no and she would be hurt, she would have to say &amp;quot;You never pass the da*n salt, you jerk.&amp;quot; Then if I pass the salt she gets what she wants, but if not, she didn&amp;#39;t have to be vulnerable. This had a corrosive effect on the relationship.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splitting.&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m the devil. Some truamatic event would have to happen that would cause her to rethink her entire life orientation. This did happen, once like a midlife crisis, and once at a homeschooling retreat I did not go to when she got a hotel room. She came back and was kind to me. It lasted two weeks until she said she couldn&amp;#39;t do it, I was too much of an idiot, and she went back to her old ways. The first one was a childbirth, and it was a negative change that made the relationship change from bad to intolerable. I thought it was post-partum depression for the next two years, but it just never ended. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requires vulnerability.&lt;/em&gt; She&amp;#39;d have to risk rejection.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it more likely:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money.&lt;/em&gt; She really hasn&amp;#39;t put any effort in to provide for herself that I&amp;#39;m aware of. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy to plan.&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m getting to the edge of consensus, but one of the qualities of NPD/BPD is the lack of long-term planning portions of executive function, due to malformed pre frontal cortex. She went to college, like people her age did, and was smart enough to get into a good one, but got a liberal arts degree with no clear path to a career. From what i can tell, in the years since leaving, she hasn&amp;#39;t really stuck through with any personal development plan to accomplish anything, no college at night, etc. My support for several years was enough that should could have gone to school at night to pursue something. For the past several years she&amp;#39;s had the work-week free during the school year, and before that she had baby-sitters living in the house.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ability to change memories.&lt;/em&gt; Awhile back I was working in the attic and found an old love letter delivered to me on our 10 year anniversary. I don&amp;#39;t think it was though; I don&amp;#39;t think she delivered it. The whole thing was incredibly sticky-sweet, about how she loved me, we were perfect to each other and things were so great and even when they seemed hard they were really great. THIS IS SO WEIRD, because when things were not great they &lt;em&gt;suuuuuucked.&lt;/em&gt; Yet in the annullment paperwork, she said she never loved me and that she thought I was her only chance at getting married.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, I&amp;#39;m wondering if, given the scenarios above, it is possible that she would decide to try and restart relations. Honestly I&amp;#39;d love a better co-parenting relationship, and could use even a minor romantic relationship to reconnect with the older children. Plus I&amp;#39;ve learned the boundaries skills to stay safe/sane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offhand, I think the inability to be vulnerable would clinch it. She&amp;#39;s trapped herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, before you say, it&amp;#39;s obvious to me I still have some attachment issues to work through - like - why think about this? Why type ALL THIS UP about something that is extremely unlikely to happen, and if it does the right answer is to peace out? Clearly I have more work to do on myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "I finished Ozark last week, and it got me thinking about Money Laundering in other shows, such as Good Girls and Breaking Bad, along with famed internet money waster and playboyish person Dan Bilzerian. First let's cover Dan /a little/. There's a quick 18 minute video on him ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD7rdgTLfHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD7rdgTLfHw) ). The short summary is that his father is a convicted wallstreet fraudster who went to jail for  four years who appears to have transferred most of his assets to his wife/children to avoid a $62 million judgement from the SEC, then declared bankruptcy, which allows him to keep his house, which was lavish. Dan grows up, drops out of college, does middlingly poorly in the world poker tourneyment, takes steroids, develops huge muscles, and claims to have won $70 million in poker, which he uses to start his company, which sells vape products and CBD oil. Then Dan goes on to life a public instagram promoter lifestyle where he flys in private planes, hangs out with 3 to 20 bikini models at a time, on private boats, private planes, with andrew tate, etc. At the same time that he presents as a high IQ genius that can win 10 to 50 million in a single poker game, Dan's demonstrated analysis and systems thinking ... leave something to be desired.\n\nI don't know about his case, but it might be helpful to use his ridiculous lifestyle as a speculative example of money laundering, Ozark-Style. He does, for example, present as an instagram influencer, and has claimed his house and lifestyle are legitimate expenses of the business.\n\nIt gets confusing to me, though, as Ozark-style is very different than Breaking Bad Style.\n\nBreaking bad style is pretty straightforward, you inflate income in a cash based business to make it look legitimate. You fake car wash receipts etc.\n\nOzark style is different. Marty began by inflating EXPENSE costs. At the beginning of the series, he was doing this so people wouldn't suspect his large cash deposits which went to overseas accounts using sophisticated, hard to track transfers. It's a work of fiction, of course, you'd think any auditor would look at his acoounts and see where the money is transferred and see it is not a legitimate US business, but I suppose they wouldn't have access to that without a warrant, and he'd work to make sure they never got probably cause. He started with $8 million that looked legitimate that he needed to get to the Cartel. After that, though, he had to KEEP getting money back to mexico. This is different than breaking bad, where they did not need a trick to make money disappear to send it anywhere, as they just needed it locally. So the ozarK trick is to inflate income through the casino/strip club, but then inflate expenses to match so no one asks where the money went.\n\nWith Dan Bilzerian, my guess is, if it was a money-laundering scheme, the plan could be two-fold. First, he had a trust fund which was worth $96 million at one time ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWo4cskbjZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWo4cskbjZE) ). His story is that he lost 96% of it either with the stock going down and giving money to his father to repay the SEC. Then he won $70 million playing poker. It doesn't make sense to me. It's possible the money is just so he can have a success story; it's possible the gambling is a cover from money coming in from nowhere. His defense of how he can \"prove\" he won it gambling seems, to me, nonsensical. Not just nonsense, but given the time he had to prepare his story, it just is not the output of a genius level IQ. Or even someone modestly above average enough to do well in calculus class.\n\nThen he founds this company, IGNITE, that goes public, and lives this incredible lavish instagram influencer lifestyle where he shoots guns, hangs out with girls in bikinis, flies in massive helicopters and private jets, enjoys expensive meals ... that's mostly it. Lots of bikinis.\n\nOne possible interpretation here is that the expensive lifestyle is the whole thing is an attempt to bilk the investors in ignite. There might be a private entertainment company (or a few) that is very profitable that books the ladies helicopters etc and takes a markup. Or the receipts could be inflated, Ozark-style. Either way, any IRS auditor (the company is based in Canada, perhaps because of looser oversight) would look at the receipts and say \"well, they are idiots, but it certainly looks like they are spending bazillions in advertising.\" Thus, the company looks super unprofitable, and gets funding from sales of stock. Meanwhile, the people actually controlling the company are essentially transferring the investors money to themselves after a haircut of 15-50% to create content that looks like it was super expensive.\n\nIf you check out his instagram, though, they do things like make a video hanging out at a hanger with a private jet in the background, or re-use content from videos in a mashup. The video in the hanger might be a lot cheaper than actually flying in the plane. And it is certainly possible he could spend a very expensive couple of days, then milk that material to make it look like it was a very expensive month.\n\nBasically - anyone with insight into how Ozark style laundering works, I'd love to hear more about it. Or any thoughts on what someone like Dan B might be doing if they were laundering.\n\nFrankly, this sounds like a coffeezilla-style possible investigation to me.  Am I wrong?",

I've been trying to put my finger on it.\n\nSometimes the resolution is simple - a piece of paper that proves something, the other person is intimidated and settles.\n\nOften though, it seems the person just kinds of ... goes away.\n\nI'm on a rewatch, in S3E1. The biggest example I can give is Hardman. The show never really resolved the 44 location class action with him, did it? Instead, the firm merged with a British company that was going to provide them the resources to fight it. Then ... that's it.  Hardman's gone. They never even discussed if it was settled or litigated or what. Then the new named partner asked Harvey where he wants scottie, he answers off-screen, and we see scottie get on an elevator. That's it. Goodbye Scottie.\n\nBefore Hardman, the existential crisis was Robert Zane. Except he hired hardman as a contractor. So when the Hardman existisitential crisis dissipated, Zane is gone too, because he only existed as a crisis through the same lawsuit.\n\nBefore that donna got fired.  But she came back because ... why did she come back? Harvey was just kind of \"I'm going to re hire her\" then. He did and that was it? I may have miffed the timeline, was that after they figured out that hardman forged the admission slip? Donna still shredded what she thought was evidence. Jessica doesn't even object. He just says it and Donna is back.\n\nOh, speaking of which, there was some sort of conflict before that with tanner. But Hardman just dug up some dirt on tanner and tanner went away. Except there never really WAS any real dirt on tanner. Hardman made it up ... or ... something? So why did tanner go away?\n\nIn a different thread/subreddit, someone wrote this, that kind of inspired me:\n\n*\"I'm binging it for background tv with my partner when we both are working from home, and it's such a funny show. Totally easily consumable, but at some point none of it makes sense, it's completely predictable and all the main characters are such smug dicks.\"*\n\nI think I understand this but if some of you have a better idea I'd love to hear about it. Or just clear up exactly what happened.\n\nOne thing that might help: Last night I went to sleep watching suits S3E1 and this morning I woke up to it. Mike was going to quit when I went to sleep. When I woke up, Rachel came in his office (wait, he has an office?) and Mike said he couldn't, because he tried but Jessica cut him off and gave him an office. (Wait, she gave him an office?)\n\nThen I re-watched. They didn't talk about the office at all. If I hadn't been watching, just listening, I might not have even realized an office was involved at all. Instead I remember this speech by Jessica about getting a car that, at the time, seemed to have no purpose, followed by the hilarious sight-comedy scene with Donna and Louis that I actually remember (so I WAS watching!)\n\nOn re-watch I can see that Jessica was saying that he got an office out of the way he betrayed harvey (which I don't remember) but that he'd see it as a good thing someday.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nI'm enjoying Suits, but I litterally can't seem to remember the way conflicts are resolved or what they mean. It may be because it happens so quickly; it might be the music. It might be because I literally expect a mediation or a gavel bang from a judge and that isn't the way the show shows conflict resolution. I don't know.\n\nIf someone can give me some attention brain tricks to remember this stuff, or a website that I can go to refresh my memory, I'd appreciate it. (I know this is not just me, because a friend recently was talking about the show, and she kept talking about the bad impact to the firm, like losing clients, etc, but she couldn't remember WHY the thing was happening, and even implied the show never told us. I think the show did show us, but it was this background thing that happened while two people were yelling \"that's not what I mean and you know it !\" or \"You're dosh darn right I gosh darn did!\" etc. That is, the interpersonal conflict in the moment actually trumped the plot.)\n\nIn that way, suits might be interpersonal conflict porn the way some shows are gun porn.  ( [https://www.americanpraetorians.com/on-gun-porn/](https://www.americanpraetorians.com/on-gun-porn/) )\n\nInsights welcome! What do you think?",

So why did tanner go away?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a different thread/subreddit, someone wrote this, that kind of inspired me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m binging it for background tv with my partner when we both are working from home, and it&amp;#39;s such a funny show. Totally easily consumable, but at some point none of it makes sense, it&amp;#39;s completely predictable and all the main characters are such smug dicks.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I understand this but if some of you have a better idea I&amp;#39;d love to hear about it. Or just clear up exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that might help: Last night I went to sleep watching suits S3E1 and this morning I woke up to it. Mike was going to quit when I went to sleep. When I woke up, Rachel came in his office (wait, he has an office?) and Mike said he couldn&amp;#39;t, because he tried but Jessica cut him off and gave him an office. (Wait, she gave him an office?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I re-watched. They didn&amp;#39;t talk about the office at all. If I hadn&amp;#39;t been watching, just listening, I might not have even realized an office was involved at all. Instead I remember this speech by Jessica about getting a car that, at the time, seemed to have no purpose, followed by the hilarious sight-comedy scene with Donna and Louis that I actually remember (so I WAS watching!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On re-watch I can see that Jessica was saying that he got an office out of the way he betrayed harvey (which I don&amp;#39;t remember) but that he&amp;#39;d see it as a good thing someday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m enjoying Suits, but I litterally can&amp;#39;t seem to remember the way conflicts are resolved or what they mean. It may be because it happens so quickly; it might be the music. It might be because I literally expect a mediation or a gavel bang from a judge and that isn&amp;#39;t the way the show shows conflict resolution. I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone can give me some attention brain tricks to remember this stuff, or a website that I can go to refresh my memory, I&amp;#39;d appreciate it. (I know this is not just me, because a friend recently was talking about the show, and she kept talking about the bad impact to the firm, like losing clients, etc, but she couldn&amp;#39;t remember WHY the thing was happening, and even implied the show never told us. I think the show did show us, but it was this background thing that happened while two people were yelling &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s not what I mean and you know it !&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re dosh darn right I gosh darn did!&amp;quot; etc. That is, the interpersonal conflict in the moment actually trumped the plot.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that way, suits might be interpersonal conflict porn the way some shows are gun porn.  ( &lt;a href=\"https://www.americanpraetorians.com/on-gun-porn/\"&gt;https://www.americanpraetorians.com/on-gun-porn/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Insights welcome!

That was amazing. From there we typically french kissed.\n\nAt some point around the first baby she stopped doing \"deep\" kisses. I mean, she wouldn't open her mouth. Like ... ever.

I don't like it.\"\n\nSo I didn't anymore. I found kissing her way to be very unsatisfying. My jaw actually hurt a bit, I think just because of habit. I did not beg or plead or coerce; I might bring it up once or twice a year on my birthday. We did what she wanted though, for sure. Slowly she asked me to do less and less of everything. The last four years of the marriage she would not accept hugs, kisses, \"I love you\" would be responded with \"don't lie to me.\" The last six months, at her request, I stopped /attempting/ to hug her. I kind of get all those, and that could be a different post.\n\nMy /guess/ is that she just didn't enjoy that style of kissing, and she had switched modes from \"do anything to get the man\" to \"now I am secure and I can tell him how it will be.\" So she started to tell me how she really felt (good) and insist things are done exactly her way, every time. If I complied, that would feed the insecurity for a day, but it would come back tomorrow with more control. (Not so good?) \n\nI don't get the comment about a fence post. Here I am trying to connect on a intimate, deep level (our religion would say \"two becoming one flesh\") and she comes up with an incredibly dismissive example. I think that's just how narcissism and devaluation work, but man ... whut.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, I think a comment might be more like \"I know you enjoy (activity) - it doesn't really do much for me. I think it could, maybe, if things were a little different. And I don't mind a little of it sometimes, but if it doesn't change, I don't want to do it all the time. I think we need a little variety. I'd like to talk about it. Experimenting could be fun.\"\n\nShe /could/ have said that. She didn't. I don't know if I would call her behavior in this instance \"abuse\", but I think it is narcissistic. She is superior, I'm inferior, she makes the rules, they are oriented around control and power, we don't explain, she never has to be vulnerable, etc.\n\nThere is a reason I am on this sub.\n\nI'd appreciate your thoughts and comments.",

There's a lot I can do to cut expenses, but I would really like to find a couple free or cheap hobbies that contributes to my life, preferably that I can involve my 9 year old daughter in. (I am a single dad with the majority of custody).\n\nI live in a small town in my midwest with a population of 5,000 or so that is the county seat to a county of 100,000. There are a couple of mid-sized metros within a hour's drive that have populations more like 200,000-500,000 depending on how you count it.\n\nFor now I can get back into duoLingo and learning a foreign language; my house has a piano in it. In the spring I'm going to try gardening. I am left handed and have a left-handed guitar, but the instructions are seem dominated for righties. I don't know how to read sheet music. I'm also thinking that getting into home improvement myself might be a good use of my time, possibly changing my own vehicle oil this summer.\n\nI am ten miles from a state forest and fifteen from two ski lifts. There is a pinball arcade, local park (wirth frisbee golf!) and a social club I belong to within walking distance. I like to take walks. I am modestly active in my church. My daughter and I both like board games and chess. I don't care for organized sports or hunting/fishing, but she has an interest in fishing. In the summer when it is 50/50 I could see a universe where I doordash. I expect to do another thread, another day, about activities for my daughter.\n\nAny ideas on how to take this wealth of natural resources and find some hobbies? Just typing it gives me some ideas. \n\nUPDATE: I'm totally intimidated by most of these things and don't know where to start. For example:\n\n* Gardening. What actually grows easy in the midwest?\n* Piano. Where can I get a helpful book or video free or cheap?\n* Home Improvement. Geez. I am intimidated\n* Changing my own oil. When can find info on my make/model/year? Where can I find the time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

There are a couple of mid-sized metros within a hour&amp;#39;s drive that have populations more like 200,000-500,000 depending on how you count it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For now I can get back into duoLingo and learning a foreign language; my house has a piano in it. In the spring I&amp;#39;m going to try gardening. I am left handed and have a left-handed guitar, but the instructions are seem dominated for righties. I don&amp;#39;t know how to read sheet music. I&amp;#39;m also thinking that getting into home improvement myself might be a good use of my time, possibly changing my own vehicle oil this summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am ten miles from a state forest and fifteen from two ski lifts. There is a pinball arcade, local park (wirth frisbee golf!) and a social club I belong to within walking distance. I like to take walks. I am modestly active in my church. My daughter and I both like board games and chess. I don&amp;#39;t care for organized sports or hunting/fishing, but she has an interest in fishing. In the summer when it is 50/50 I could see a universe where I doordash. I expect to do another thread, another day, about activities for my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ideas on how to take this wealth of natural resources and find some hobbies? Just typing it gives me some ideas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I&amp;#39;m totally intimidated by most of these things and don&amp;#39;t know where to start. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gardening. What actually grows easy in the midwest?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Piano. Where can I get a helpful book or video free or cheap?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Home Improvement. Geez. I am intimidated&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changing my own oil. When can find info on my make/model/year? Where can I find the time?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

(The simplest example: I need to do better AND I am \"okay\" as I am.) I said that victim\\_name lacked this.\n\nSomeone gave this reply, which reminds me of NXIVM:\n\n&gt;It also explains why (victim\\_name) is in so deep. Adherence to cults/cultic leaders requires the inability to do precisely what you describe. The mark must be susceptible to “cognitive dissonance” so that they refuse to believe two opposing ideas could both be true simultaneously. Without this, they could soon figure out the cult leader is a manipulative liar due to the many inconsistent statements and actions. Narcissist\\_name exerts her control over victim\\_name this way. She points to something very narrow telling him if this is true then all these other things must also be true. He drinks the Koolaid and suddenly the preposterous or pure happenstance is part of an evil plot against him. Very wise observation! He clearly needs better mental health care providers. Preferably ones who don’t recommend bad\\_advice\\_he\\_talked\\_about\\_publicly to help you heal.\n\nAnother term for this is black and white thinking. It is a kind of immaturity. Black and white thinkers tend to be attracted to simplistic answers that explain everything. The \"redpill\"-ish logic of SOP, the oversimplification/overgeneralization of girls and boys, for example.\n\nPersonally, I've believed for some time that being in a liminal state makes one susceptible. That is, around the time of change where your identity was taken away -- just after a divorce, just after graduating high school, at the start of college, after graduating college with no job prospects in your chosen field, death of a key family member, loss of a beloved home, anytime you aren't quite sure of \"what's next\" or don't know who you are.\n\nThat said, the appeal of easy answers, plus the insta-family these groups seem to provide, could be part of it.\n\nSome people (including mark V) seem to want to go from cult to cult. Often we say that is due to some unhealed trauma, and maybe so. But it might also be a little loneliness plus a desire for easy answers.\n\nI read once that there are three paths in life. You can abandon responsibility and be a victim. You can turn to some other expert and say \"tell me what to do, I'll do it.\" - make someone else responsible. Or you can take on personal responsibility for yourself and, perhaps, others, /despite/ the manifestly unjust world. That path of personal responsibility is the path of the hero.\n\nPerhaps people who join cults are looking for someone to fix them, a little lonely, and attracted easy black/white answers.\n\nThe right choice for their lives probably came from Spaceballs: The Schwartz is in you, lonestar. It's in you!\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nI replied to a comment that I thought I'd share here.\n\n&gt;This being said,I find your comments about three paths in life overly simplistic. And I think consciously trying to be a hero is an ego trap that actually diminishes the odds of doing good things.\n\nI was speaking of Joseph Campbell's Hero's journey. There's a fair bit more to it than that, and a fair bit of success literature around it. I totally grant that the couple sentences I wrote above sound simplistic. \n\nI also think you are correct about Trauma. Trauma in childhood can damage the attachment system. People with damaged attachment systems are often looking for a father-figure.  The father-figure would tell them what to do, my second path. They want the approval of this figure to replace whatever lack of support they had in childhood. \n\nAnd I think you're right about Black/white thinking  -- it is a normal developmental stage, and people with serious trauma often just sort of ... stop growing. And following Keith, I expect they would continue to not develop emotionally. \n\nSo that leaves us a couple of places people could be, or backgrounds they could have, that would cause weaker boundaries and looking for a father figure. So yes, I was looking at symptoms - I think you make a strong point.\n\nThank you. I got some insight. That is what I was looking for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Currently, her podcast is about as popular as say Jordan Peterson, who I have the impression does the podcast for free in trade for book promotion, speaking engagement promotion, online product promotion, and maybe some affiliate marketing. But the /platform/ likely doesn't pay him. If they do, it's likely 1/10th what they pay Joe Rogan.\n\nMy thought here is that archetypes can't go away. There is no way Spotify will be cool with this.\n\nActually I see four options:\n\n1. Spotify forces them to do more episodes. This is just a \"hiatus\"\n2. Spotify only pays out a tiny fraction of the $$ as they are paid by the episode\n3. Spotify ask for their money back and this gets ugly fast\n4. Meghan and Harry take the money and run. They continue to burn bridges (netflix first, now spotty) until they run out of people who will work with this.\n\nMy guess is a combination of 2 and 1.

Currently, her podcast is about as popular as say Jordan Peterson, who I have the impression does the podcast for free in trade for book promotion, speaking engagement promotion, online product promotion, and maybe some affiliate marketing. But the /platform/ likely doesn&amp;#39;t pay him. If they do, it&amp;#39;s likely 1/10th what they pay Joe Rogan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My thought here is that archetypes can&amp;#39;t go away. There is no way Spotify will be cool with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually I see four options:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Spotify forces them to do more episodes. This is just a &amp;quot;hiatus&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Spotify only pays out a tiny fraction of the $$ as they are paid by the episode&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Spotify ask for their money back and this gets ugly fast&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meghan and Harry take the money and run. They continue to burn bridges (netflix first, now spotty) until they run out of people who will work with this.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is a combination of 2 and 1. She&amp;#39;ll go on &amp;quot;hiatus&amp;quot; for six months then show more pre-recorded schlock again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone with insight, I&amp;#39;m interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

In their emotional world, when we start out the relationship, the love-drugs like dopamine and adrenaline are firing and they feel good and are freed from their existential pain and we are wonderful.

Their insecurities come for them and they externalize blame. Now six months or sixteen years later, they are BORED. This cannot be their fault. It must be someone else's fault. And if they leave a reasonable marriage because it isn't a fit that is failure, and they can't be a failure, and they externalize blame anyway so it MUST BE THE PARTNERS FAULT. And if it is the partners fault and you split all good or all bad, the partner must be ALL BAD and worthy of contempt. In fact, as the current emotional reality is reality, it must have always been like that. Somehow we tricked them. They were young and naive. It isn't their fault, they are a victim.

Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.

If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened -- that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed -if all records told the same tale -- then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered.

That is, they look for the presence of grandiosity, need for admiration, entitlement, exploitive behavior, lack of empathy, etc.\n\nBut I wonder.\n\nOver and over and over again, here and in other places, I read that narc's, Bordernlines, and other people who are cluster-b cannot process emotion the same way regular ordered people can.\n\nSo why not ask them questions designed to elicit emotions?\n\nFor example -\n\n\\- Tell me about a time you did something wrong. How did you feel about it? What did you do to make it right? How do you feel about it now?\n\n\\- Tell me about a time you were angry. What happened? What did you do about it?\n\n\\- Tell me about a sense of loss or grief you had ...\n\nThe goal here is to get the person to be vulnerable and admit making a mistake when they have nothing to gain. Of course, some men from a different generation were raised to never be vulnerable, they could be fine humans and not-narcs, and \"Fail\" such a test. And some narcs can appear vulnerable/embarassed/ashamed as a charm technique to build faux trust and faux intimacy. So you have to be careful.\n\nBut if all you see is blame - if that is \\*\\*all\\*\\* you see ... that is probably telling you something.\n\nEven then, I can remember a time with the week of my nex filing for divorce that I had a conversation about the breakdown of the relationship and refused to take any responsibility. Looking back now, months later, I can take ... some.\n\nSo it's a fallible test. Thinking in terms of \"A narc cannot experience genuine human emotion, and cannot relate authentically with the potential for loss\" has helped me \"figure out\" and \"test\" for people that are unsafe emotionally.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, when clinicians check for narcissism, they try to go by the DSM-5. That is, they look for the presence of grandiosity, need for admiration, entitlement, exploitive behavior, lack of empathy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over and over and over again, here and in other places, I read that narc&amp;#39;s, Bordernlines, and other people who are cluster-b cannot process emotion the same way regular ordered people can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why not ask them questions designed to elicit emotions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Tell me about a time you did something wrong. How did you feel about it? What did you do to make it right? How do you feel about it now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Tell me about a time you were angry. What happened? What did you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Tell me about a sense of loss or grief you had ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to get the person to be vulnerable and admit making a mistake when they have nothing to gain. Of course, some men from a different generation were raised to never be vulnerable, they could be fine humans and not-narcs, and &amp;quot;Fail&amp;quot; such a test. And some narcs can appear vulnerable/embarassed/ashamed as a charm technique to build faux trust and faux intimacy. So you have to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if all you see is blame - if that is **all** you see ... that is probably telling you something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even then, I can remember a time with the week of my nex filing for divorce that I had a conversation about the breakdown of the relationship and refused to take any responsibility. Looking back now, months later, I can take ... some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s a fallible test. Thinking in terms of &amp;quot;A narc cannot experience genuine human emotion, and cannot relate authentically with the potential for loss&amp;quot; has helped me &amp;quot;figure out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; for people that are unsafe emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
