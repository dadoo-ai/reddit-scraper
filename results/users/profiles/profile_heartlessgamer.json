Of games that I can count as a success; every single one of them was enjoyable to play the moment you sat down and played it.  That includes games where I was an early tester.\n\nThere is always this argument of \"you need to give it 100 hours\".  I've always pushed back on that and counter with \"no, the game needs to get me in the first few minutes or it isn't a good game\".  I can't name a single game where I pushed through a bad start and made it to 100+ hours where I looked back and said \"oh yeah; I just needed that 100 hours\".  \n\nSadly I am a sucker and keep playing bad games for far longer than I should be but thus is the existence of an MMO gamer.\n\nWith that said I have yet to play Ashes of Creation.  I feel like me not buying in to play is sending a message louder than the words I'm typing.  I am the type of gamer that would be all over testing a game like Ashes and I'm not.",

Of games that I can count as a success; every single one of them was enjoyable to play the moment you sat down and played it.  That includes games where I was an early tester.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is always this argument of &amp;quot;you need to give it 100 hours&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;ve always pushed back on that and counter with &amp;quot;no, the game needs to get me in the first few minutes or it isn&amp;#39;t a good game&amp;quot;.  I can&amp;#39;t name a single game where I pushed through a bad start and made it to 100+ hours where I looked back and said &amp;quot;oh yeah; I just needed that 100 hours&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly I am a sucker and keep playing bad games for far longer than I should be but thus is the existence of an MMO gamer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said I have yet to play Ashes of Creation.  I feel like me not buying in to play is sending a message louder than the words I&amp;#39;m typing.  I am the type of gamer that would be all over testing a game like Ashes and I&amp;#39;m not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "communityName": "r/throneandliberty",
    "parsedCommunityName": "throneandliberty",
    "body": "If you want to see screenshots you can see them in the version of this on my blog: [https://www.heartlessgamer.com/2024/07/final-thoughts-throne-and-liberty.html](https://www.heartlessgamer.com/2024/07/final-thoughts-throne-and-liberty.html)\n\n \n\nAt the surface Throne and Liberty is a very polished game.  The  graphics are amazing.  Performance is top notch.  It is massive and  nails multiplayer with masses of players running around everywhere.   Quality of life features abound.  However just below the makeup there is  some things we need to talk about.  Here are my final thoughts after 15  hours with the Throne and Liberty global beta. \n\n First  I do want to reiterate how amazing this game looks and how well it  runs.  I am still amazed how they are able to get the game to run  without any loading screens.  That alone is worth recommending the game  as it is so refreshing to boot up a game, select a character, and then a  few seconds (not minutes) later you are in the world.  The same goes  for teleporting.  Add in the performance both in how it runs on your  machine and how it seemingly maintains a lag-free world with hundreds of  players running around it is clear they have some magic sauce!\n\n The  problem, for me, comes in that the game didn't hook me.  For comparison  I hit 50+ hours played in both the New World open beta and more  recently in Once Human's open beta which both ran shorter than Throne's  beta where I hit 15 hours. I did keep coming back to play Throne but  once I got past how amazing the world feels, the shock of teleporting  around without loading screens, and how fun it is to chase after the  giant flying whale at some point I had to interact with the story and  engage in the combat.  That is where the game started to lose me (but  not entirely).\n\n I'll admit in my older age I am not one for  sitting around dialogue screens or cut-scenes in RPGs.  For a while now  I've felt that if a game can't deliver the story content without having  to stop and bring me to a separate screen that the story probably was  click through material. \n\n  Throne delivers some of it's story via  interactive mechanisms but there is still a lot of time spent in  dialogue screens or cut scenes.  By the end of the beta I was pressing F  and ESC as fast as I could to get out of them.  The story is just not  interesting and most story quests are monotonous. Seriously; one of the  last quests I did in beta had me talk to someone, walk a few feet to  pick up a burlap sack, then walk a few feet and put the sack in a fire,  and then just turn to talk to the person again!  That was it.  Nothing  more.  I don't need to be doing mundane quest steps in 2024!\n\n Dotted  between the mundane story questing are instanced solo encounters which  provide more meaty content usually focused around some sort of combat  encounter. These are better than the burlap sack burning experience but  aren't anything to write home about.  I just don't have the patience for  story in MMORPGs anymore.  Get me to the world and interacting with  other players!  With that said Throne is not much different from other  games in the genre and at least it has some cut scenes worth watching.\n\n There  are parts of Throne where the game does a better job of delivering  information to the player. For example in the world events, as you are  doing the event, a fully narrated set of updates for the event appear on  your screen.  They don't require you to interact with them and go away  all by themselves.  I found it a good way to keep me engaged in the  event progress.\n\n Additionally I think the team behind Throne  realized that many players are like me and click through content as fast  as possible.  After most story moments or tutorial quests the game has a  fully voice narrated \"here is a summary of what just happened\" that  plays for you while you go about your business.  Personally I feel they  could have just done this vs much of the mundane dialogue screens in the  game.  In fact I really liked the after-the-fact narration (I know some  testers did not).\n\n Also in the story quest there are points  where you interact with items and have to go to another screen to  manipulate the item.  This is it's own screen (again, taking you out of  the world) and you have to flip the item around and then click on the  right spot to unlock the next part of the puzzle.  The first experience  with this was a \"fake\" book that really had a key hidden inside.  I did  not find it interesting at all and felt like it was wasting my time.   \n\n It  is rare enough to have to inspect an item that it's not a headache but  it brings up a question of consistency.  Why not make all quest items  work like this?  Why just here and there?  I am a big believer in games  being consistent and this just seemed like a tacked on feature used some  of the time.  The screen itself that you use is also not intuitive at  all.  I had to look up help on how to do it because clicking was doing  nothing (you have to hold your click down when the cursor changes icons  which means you can really just fake your way through it vs it being  some sort of puzzle).\n\n The  quests and events in the game do offer variety.  I did enjoy some early  quests such as the one where I morphed into a mouse and had to  literally play \"cat and mouse\" dodging a cat only to find out the cat  was a morphed bad guy.  However, too much of the main story was just run  here do this then run there.  I honestly think the game may have been  better without the main story and instead just focused on the world  events.\n\n I say this because there are so many freaking events  happening in the world in this game.  It was refreshing to see a world  that looked alive! Hitting the \"schedule\" button and seeing all the  possible events occurring was cool.  I barely scratched the surface of  events and had fun in every event I jumped into.  My only disappointment  was missing an event and having to wait hours for the next time. I  didn't even get to PvP yet and there are tons of PvP events!\n\n I  did get to try the level 20 dungeon a few times as well and it was OK.   I'll talk more on combat later and the state of combat was part of why I  say it was just OK.  The game does have a group finder which was nice  as it made it easy to get into a group and get going on the content.  As  a more solo-ish player I tend to prefer this way of getting into group  content.  \n\n The dungeon was mostly trash enemies and a couple  bosses.  The end boss was difficult to follow and I really didn't  understand why some groups failed at that boss while others seemed to do  just fine.  I was \"one shot\" multiple times at this boss and still  don't know by what or how I was supposed to dodge it (probably because I  was staring at the hotbar UI vs the boss).  At the end of the dungeons  you have to spend a currency you gradually gain each day to get rewards  and once that currency is gone I am not sure why you'd run a dungeon.   That was disappointing to learn as its basically a \"daily\" but I get it  being a way to prevent farming.\n\n Next  I want to touch on combat. I never got over the hump with it.  It just  doesn't feel as good compared to the rest of the game around it.  The  biggest issue I have is that it feels static with too much time watching  the UI.  I've said in the past that New World changed how I perceive  MMO combat.  In New World you rarely are looking at the UI and are  almost always engaged with the combat encounter in front of you.  \n\n In  Throne I kept missing things going on because I had to be either  looking at a bar of 12 different possible skill cooldowns or trying to  find whatever status message on screen I needed to find or having to  swing my camera around to find the enemy.  This leads to a lot of time  with your character just standing in place while you hit the buttons and  honestly 12 skill buttons + 4 consumable + 4 function keys is just too  much.\n\n Speaking of skills. I really don't get why the game starts  players off with access to so many of the weapon skills.  I don't want  to sound like a newbie and say it is overwhelming but it honestly is and  removes an aspect of progression and learning a game that I didn't  realize I'd miss until I played Throne and it wasn't there.  Aside from  the first tutorial scenario that teaches you the defense timing mechanic  there is nothing to walk a player through the hundreds of skills in the  game.  Players are expected to open the skills screen and figure it  out; including figuring out what order you should use them in (i.e.  rotation).  \n\n\n And it's needed because skills are complicated.  There isn't simple \"fireball goes boom\" skills.  Every skill is \"does X%  damage + applies Y effect and then has % chance for Z\".  Oh and then  based on time of day it may do something entirely different.  All I want  to do is scream.... \"why!?\".  \n\n📷The  skills screen can be daunting.  An example skill that increases block  chance and then also counterattacks but the counterattack isn't affected  by critical or heavy hit chance.  Then on being upgraded does even  more.  And you will have 12 skills of this complexity level in front of  you at any given time in combat!\n\n I  really had to dig through skills to make sense of what goes together  well and what order to fire them off in.  I can see learning your  rotation being a huge part of success in this game.  That is fine but  just not something that hooked me.  I'd much rather have been gradually  introduced to skills and had the game give me more guidance on what  works together. Don't even get me started on the fact you can have  multiple hot bars of skills set up and swap mid fight.\n\n I also  felt there was little identity with the weapons.  You can equip any two  weapons and from their array of skills you can equip 12 (again feels  like too many).  All of them sort of had the same feeling.  If it was a  ranged attack it was a ranged attack.  If it was a melee attack it was a  melee attack.  Wand, staff, sword, dagger... I didn't get a sense they  were all that much different or maybe the game failed to explain to me  how they were working differently.  I really wish the game would have  limited active skills to, at most, five at one time.  That would have  made it much more impactful to choose between the array of skills two  weapons brings the player.\n\n Ultimately whether its the skills  bonanza or the stationary state; the combat in Throne and Liberty is  it's weakest part.  It didn't lose me but it didn't hook me.  I really  dislike that you have to focus so much on the UI and thus lose focus on  the amazing game world in front of you.  Less would be more in this  game's combat.\n\nThere are some other areas of the game to touch on. \n\n The  guild system seems well fleshed out. I joined a random guild and was  immediately helping complete guild contracts and getting rewards for the  guild doing activities.  I also had multiple ways to contribute to the  guild via game mechanisms vs having to manage contribution outside of  the game.  I think this game will be a good home for guilds looking for  MMOs that reward guild play.  It will also be good for the less hardcore  guild members (i.e. solo players) to be able to contribute to the  guild.\n\n Crafting is not really crafting so much as just a set  of screens you use to combine things together.  There is upgrading gear  via enchanting but again its just a set of screens you use to progress  gear vs any sort of crafting as you would think from most MMOs (i.e. you  don't craft a sword hilt and blade to make a sword).  Some crafting,  like cooking, is coming in the launch apparently (and is available in  the Korean version as of this week).\n\n One of the biggest \"oh  really?\" moments was when I realized the game has no in game economy.  Zero.  None.  The only auction house is the one for the premium currency  (which I am fine with).  However, that auction house is limited in to  just some specific named items.  You can't, for example, craft potions  and sell them (or at least that I could see).  That was really  disappointing as markets of online games is one of my biggest  attractions.  This may change since they are adding more life skills to  the game like cooking.\n\n Another point to make in Throne's favor is  the quality of life bits.  There is a lot of polished features in this  game.  I was amazed to find that I could save my preset skill build outs  and I didn't have to buy any slots from a cash shop for the privilege.   The same goes for armor and weapons.  It is just there in the UI.  The  map is amazing and full of info.  The schedule that details events  really helps connect players to the active world.  While there is  probably too many overall screens in the interface I can't deny that  each screen is still clean and super functional.\n\n The  end question is whether I will play the game at launch and I'll give an  honest \"I don't know\" answer.  Is it possible?  Sure.  I like to jump  into MMO launches to get that launch day feeling but I'm not sure it  would be much different than what I got out of the open beta here.  The  game did grow on me a  little the further the beta went on and I used  the extra day to play some more when they extended it.\n\n I can  tell you that this beta was nothing like what I got out of New World's  open beta or more recently Once Human's.  Both of those games hooked me  and I ran out the clock on their betas and was happy to repeat at the  launch of both.  With Throne something just didn't fit together as  well.  The combat being mediocre and the lack of an actual game economy  are not great selling points.  I will end with \"maybe\" on whether I'll  play.  I really don't think the game is going to do much better in the  west than it did in Korea.  I can see now where many folks are coming  from after they tried to the Korean version and now had access to the  global beta.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to see screenshots you can see them in the version of this on my blog: &lt;a href=\"https://www.heartlessgamer.com/2024/07/final-thoughts-throne-and-liberty.html\"&gt;https://www.heartlessgamer.com/2024/07/final-thoughts-throne-and-liberty.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the surface Throne and Liberty is a very polished game.  The  graphics are amazing.  Performance is top notch.  It is massive and  nails multiplayer with masses of players running around everywhere.   Quality of life features abound.  However just below the makeup there is  some things we need to talk about.  Here are my final thoughts after 15  hours with the Throne and Liberty global beta. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; First  I do want to reiterate how amazing this game looks and how well it  runs.  I am still amazed how they are able to get the game to run  without any loading screens.  That alone is worth recommending the game  as it is so refreshing to boot up a game, select a character, and then a  few seconds (not minutes) later you are in the world.  The same goes  for teleporting.  Add in the performance both in how it runs on your  machine and how it seemingly maintains a lag-free world with hundreds of  players running around it is clear they have some magic sauce!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; The  problem, for me, comes in that the game didn&amp;#39;t hook me.  For comparison  I hit 50+ hours played in both the New World open beta and more  recently in Once Human&amp;#39;s open beta which both ran shorter than Throne&amp;#39;s  beta where I hit 15 hours. I did keep coming back to play Throne but  once I got past how amazing the world feels, the shock of teleporting  around without loading screens, and how fun it is to chase after the  giant flying whale at some point I had to interact with the story and  engage in the combat.  That is where the game started to lose me (but  not entirely).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; I&amp;#39;ll admit in my older age I am not one for  sitting around dialogue screens or cut-scenes in RPGs.  For a while now  I&amp;#39;ve felt that if a game can&amp;#39;t deliver the story content without having  to stop and bring me to a separate screen that the story probably was  click through material. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;  Throne delivers some of it&amp;#39;s story via  interactive mechanisms but there is still a lot of time spent in  dialogue screens or cut scenes.  By the end of the beta I was pressing F  and ESC as fast as I could to get out of them.  The story is just not  interesting and most story quests are monotonous. Seriously; one of the  last quests I did in beta had me talk to someone, walk a few feet to  pick up a burlap sack, then walk a few feet and put the sack in a fire,  and then just turn to talk to the person again!  That was it.  Nothing  more.  I don&amp;#39;t need to be doing mundane quest steps in 2024!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; Dotted  between the mundane story questing are instanced solo encounters which  provide more meaty content usually focused around some sort of combat  encounter. These are better than the burlap sack burning experience but  aren&amp;#39;t anything to write home about.  I just don&amp;#39;t have the patience for  story in MMORPGs anymore.  Get me to the world and interacting with  other players!  With that said Throne is not much different from other  games in the genre and at least it has some cut scenes worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; There  are parts of Throne where the game does a better job of delivering  information to the player. For example in the world events, as you are  doing the event, a fully narrated set of updates for the event appear on  your screen.  They don&amp;#39;t require you to interact with them and go away  all by themselves.  I found it a good way to keep me engaged in the  event progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; Additionally I think the team behind Throne  realized that many players are like me and click through content as fast  as possible.  After most story moments or tutorial quests the game has a  fully voice narrated &amp;quot;here is a summary of what just happened&amp;quot; that  plays for you while you go about your business.  Personally I feel they  could have just done this vs much of the mundane dialogue screens in the  game.  In fact I really liked the after-the-fact narration (I know some  testers did not).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; Also in the story quest there are points  where you interact with items and have to go to another screen to  manipulate the item.  This is it&amp;#39;s own screen (again, taking you out of  the world) and you have to flip the item around and then click on the  right spot to unlock the next part of the puzzle.  The first experience  with this was a &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; book that really had a key hidden inside.  I did  not find it interesting at all and felt like it was wasting my time.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; It  is rare enough to have to inspect an item that it&amp;#39;s not a headache but  it brings up a question of consistency.  Why not make all quest items  work like this?  Why just here and there?  I am a big believer in games  being consistent and this just seemed like a tacked on feature used some  of the time.  The screen itself that you use is also not intuitive at  all.  I had to look up help on how to do it because clicking was doing  nothing (you have to hold your click down when the cursor changes icons  which means you can really just fake your way through it vs it being  some sort of puzzle).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; The  quests and events in the game do offer variety.  I did enjoy some early  quests such as the one where I morphed into a mouse and had to  literally play &amp;quot;cat and mouse&amp;quot; dodging a cat only to find out the cat  was a morphed bad guy.  However, too much of the main story was just run  here do this then run there.  I honestly think the game may have been  better without the main story and instead just focused on the world  events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; I say this because there are so many freaking events  happening in the world in this game.  It was refreshing to see a world  that looked alive!

I was not impressed and the game has a ways to go.  What was most shocking was how rudimentary the combat was.  Having insight to even the earliest of New World's testing periods the combat in New World was never anywhere near as basic (i.e. bad) as Pax Dei's offering so far.  Point goes to New World.\n\nEven more recently I've played Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) again for the first time in a while and it didn't take me long to remember how floaty (and clunky) the combat is in that game.  Ironically ten or so years ago when ESO first launched I was not sold that an MMO could provide action combat and ESO was my poster child as to why.\n\nI can say all these years later that I was wrong about action combat in MMOs.  Action combat is New World's best selling point and while its got some growing pains right now with it's recent changes to the underlying scripting it is literal leaps and bounds better than ESO combat.  The ESO combat isn't so bad I don't want to keep playing but every fight I wish I was playing New World.\n\nWhat I do see as an advantage that ESO (or Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft, etc) have on New World is content.  ESO has a lot of content and comes out with new content chunks at a good pace.  New World has not been able to generate content at a pace that meets player expectations and some of the content, such as seasonal events, has been lackluster.  However, the games I mention didn't magically get content overnight. New World can get there with more content; they just need to figure out how to speed up the delivery.\n\nSo whether its stepping back into old games like ESO or playing new shiny games like Pax Dei; I can see clear advantages for New World against its peers.  This gives me faith that there is a future for New World that is obfuscated by folks that can't look past the steam charts for concurrent players.  New World just needs to clean up the recent combat bugs introduced by the combat code rewrite (slayer script) and get cracking on new content. /vader Frankly; I find the general lack of faith in New World to be disturbing. /end vader\n\nI'd also throw in the above mentioned games have implemented \"mega server\" tech which is sorely needed in New World.",

Or was I building towards  producing armor and weapons to go on an adventure?  The game leaves this  open ended which may be fine for some players but personally I found it  unappealing.  I felt like the game should have nudged me in some sort  of direction.\n\n There was no tutorial so I had to spend some time  on Discord asking how to get started.  Part of the issue was that when I  started the beginning materials were not abundantly available in my  area.  It seemed like that may have been a bug because they were more  easily located later in the test.  A tutorial that assures resources to  get started would be ideal for launch.\n\n Once I had starting  materials I was off and crafting.  The game was on par with any other  crafting survival game except there is not a pressing survival component  (i.e. I didn't starve to death immediately).  I built a campfire.  I  built a starting workbench.  I built the next thing and the next thing  and...\n\n ...then I hit a wall.  The crafting progression has some  bumps.  As I mentioned early on in the test some of the starting  materials were tough to find.  My first day I couldn't find clay so I  couldn't make a kiln and thus everything past that was blocked.  Later  in the test I encountered recipes for starting crafting stations that  had steep material requirements and little help guiding me to where to  get them. I think the progression can be smoothed out with a pass on  what recipes require what materials so they fall in more logical order.\n\n Gathering  was also bumpy.  Again there was clear issues early on where some  resources didn't seem to be available or weren't re-spawning (at least  that's my guess).   However, part of the issue is the game seems to have  a \"node\" system so there were times where I was surrounded by rock but I  couldn't actually gather any of that rock for recipes that needed  rock.  I got used to games in this genre, like Enshrouded, where you can  just go bash a rock pile to get rocks.\n\n One  thing that I had hoped would happen naturally was that if I hit a bump  in progression that I could rely on a neighbor who maybe had made  further progress but I found it very difficult to interact with players  in the game.  In fact I don't think I once was able to communicate or  interact with anyone even though we ran past each other numerous times.   I had to jump out to the Discord server and even then couldn't find  folks in my area and I wasn't up to run long distances to get to them.   The game needs to make it simpler to find and interact with other  players.\n\n Crafting in the game features both station crafting  where I stood at a station and crafted as well as factory crafting where  a station took inputs and some time later provided an output.  When  crafting there is a chance of success or failure that improves as skills  improve.  Personally I didn't like this as there was only a \"down side\"  (i.e. failing the craft) and no \"up side\" where if you got lucky you  got a bonus or some masterwork version of something.  \n\n Also each  individual item has to be crafted by itself and the success/failure bar  has to fill up for each.  Unfortunately this meant a lot of time just  watching the bar go up and not a lot of time playing. Add in the  progression of recipes and a massive quantity of inputs required and  players in the alpha found themselves spending hours just standing at  stations doing nothing.  I would recommend they get rid of the  success/failure mechanic and just make bulk crafting instant.  Don't  waste players time.  It is fine to have \"factory\" stations that are time  gated  but once I have materials just let me craft with one click. \n\n As  I continued to play I made progress and eventually equipped myself with  a weapon and shield.  This brought me into combat.  My first encounter  was with a bear which ended with me dead.  I opted to pick on a boar  next which... also ended in my death.  Each death meant a run back to  get my corpse to get my items back.  Corpse runs are fine I suppose.\n\n Boar  or bear there is risk to fighting with the basic weapons and part of  the problem is combat is... how should I say this... bad.  It is just  bad.  As it was an alpha I feel like I owe more words in feedback so  I'll try to give some here but don't let these words lead you to believe  there is anything to this combat system.  It is really, really bad even  for an alpha (note: they have also said this is the combat system they  expect to have for early access).\n\n The first issue with combat is  there isn't anything to it.  You left click to attack.  That is about  it.  Combat feels floaty and your actions lack weight which is odd  because combat is terribly slow.  Animations are... not good... making  it hard to connect with what is visually happening to what inputs you  are providing.  Add in desync situations with the client/server  connection and it's a poor experience.  I can't see myself playing a  game with a combat system this poor.  New World combat has spoiled me.\n\n Visually  the game offers stunning views, but I found the details to be less  impressive once you were up close.  The mountains are stunning at a  distance but generic up close with no character.  The world is clearly  procedural generated for the most part and thus lacks any points of  interest unless you walk for long distances to somewhere hand crafted.  I  suspect player buildings will make it more interesting once the game is  live but player buildings currently don't offer much of interest aside  from \"oh cool\" or \"not sure what they were building\" moments.  \n\n\n For  an alpha test the game offered a lot of pieces and I really liked day  one where a little neighborhood started popping up.  Crafting and  building are in a good spot and can get better with more reviews of  progression and recipes so they are more logical.  Seeing other players  share their builds there is a lot of potential out there in seeing the  world come alive.  If the game can then add in some better reasons to  seek out and work with other players it will hit a sweet spot for some  gamers.  However, combat 100% needs a do-over. If they cannot massively  improve combat this game is going to miss for many players. The  crafting/building is NOT better than other games in the genre and the  only advantage Pax Dei has is it's massively multiplayer with the  promise of thousands of players building in the same world together.  If  they an figure out combat and interesting content to go with it this  game will be a winner.",

    "body": "This post is mostly from the thoughts on posted on my blog (link at bottom). Felt like sharing to drum up some feedback to see where others are at in relation to my own thoughts.\n\nI have to admit there is an addictive quality to the game.  I found myself saying \"just one more level\" or \"one more dungeon\" before I had to finally cut myself off late into the night morning (oh, the sun is almost up).  I haven't binge played a beta like this since New World.\n\nI started as a Barbarian but found melee to be rough in this game.  Ranged attacks seemed like the way to go and after a few jaunts through Reddit and a couple YouTube videos it was clear ranged was the way to go so I restarted as a necromancer.\n\nIt was playing as the necromancer that the game grabbed me and didn't let go.  A satisfying drip drip drip of loot flush with constant upgrades.  Ranged combat that was far more manageable than up close melee.  A map filled with points of interest and \"go here\" indicators.\n\nThere was also a story which from the community accounts is pretty good, but within 30 minutes I was back to \"skip\".  It is the rare game that catches my attention for story and in an \"action RPG\" the last thing I am diving into is story.  It was also a beta and I needed to avoid FOMO on the beta rewards for reaching level 20.  I still got the gist of the story.\n\nAction combat and story aside there is a lot else going on in Diablo 4.  There is \"crafting and gathering\" in a sense as you can upgrade gear and gather nodes throughout your adventures.  It does not seem like there is a cradle-to-grave crafting system and it's mostly focused on upgrades.\n\nThere are \"open world\" zones you inhabit with other players; a little MMO to go with the action RPG.  These zones can have dynamic events where multiple players can participate, but rarely did I run into that scenario.  Towns featured other players and the lag to go with them.  I am lukewarm on this feature and not sure it fits.\n\nWhile the game was binge-worthy there were some things that didn't sit quite right with me and in my post-binge clarity have kept me from hitting that pre-purchase button.\n\nChief among things that didn't sit quite right was the theme.  The opening cinematic (along with some of the early story) is pretty gruesome.  This is not a game I would feel comfortable playing in front of my 13 year old or letting him play.  Maybe it is old age, and I am not sure what I expected from a game in the Diablo franchise, but I have a hard time saying I am going to sit through this dark and drab world for hundreds of hours.\n\nThe other major issue I had was the zoom level; it is way too close.  There were multiple boss battles where I legitimately could not see what was going on.  Playing as a necromancer with lots of pets I often found my pet skeletons at the edge of the screen chopping down what was next.  I would jump in with ranged attacks at screens edge with little idea what I was even hitting.  The game needs to zoom out.\n\nAlso I found a lack of reward in getting rewards.  The constant drip of loot is great and the pace at which upgrades come is excellent (at least in the early leveling we got in the beta), but other than some numbers going up I found little in the way of variety.  Sword better than the wand you had?  Equip it.  Scythe better than the sword and shield you had? Equip it.  While that can be satisfying it also meant that I was never really attached to anything.\n\nMaybe this changes with the legendary loot and the special ability it comes with (which you can extract and stick in other gear), but as it stood in the beta I never got a sense of being rewarded for my play style.  There was a distinct lack of attachment to the weapon and armor I was obtaining and thus a distinct lack of feeling rewarded.\n\nLast, a quick note on balance.  The classes were not balanced for this beta.  RIP anyone trying to play on harder difficulty as melee.  Melee is weak.  Playing as a necromancer was a cakewalk in comparison to barbarian.  I trust they will tune this up for launch, but it is worth noting because it was that imbalanced in the beta.\n\nI haven't paid attention to Diablo in a long time and had mostly written off Blizzard since the Activision merger.  So I was not keeping tabs on the game coming and it was honestly only through some streamers I follow that my interest got piqued.  This was a similar trajectory that brought me to New World (where I've spent thousands of hours now).  There was a lot to like about Diablo 4 and it's on my \"possible\" list, but I do struggle with the theme and whether I really can stick that out for any length of time.\n\nOriginal post on my blog: [https://www.heartlessgamer.com/2023/03/conflicted-thoughts-on-diablo-4-beta.html](https://www.heartlessgamer.com/2023/03/conflicted-thoughts-on-diablo-4-beta.html)",

    "body": "I posted this to my blog ([link](http://www.heartlessgamer.com/2021/08/thoughts-from-new-world-closed-beta.html)) but copying here for the more likely chance of generating conversation.\n\nNew World (from Amazon Game Studios) held a closed beta over the last  two weeks and I had the opportunity to play a few hours over two weeks.   And by few I mean 50+ hours!  I have not enjoyed a game this much in  years and I am here to tell you all about it so sit back and relax; it's  a New World!\n\n## Visually Stunning!  Sounds Great!\n\nThe  most immediate thing about New World is how amazing it looks.  Everything  looks amazing from the  moment you set foot in the world.  Take a journey up to any of the  mountain tops and the vistas are breathtaking.  Sit back in popular PvP  areas and watch the fireworks as players battle each other; ranged PvP  combat is especially fun to watch.  Walk into a settlement and marvel at  the detail of the buildings (crafting workstations especially).  Combat  effects, player movement, armor, weapons, and so much more are top  notch.\n\nThe  next immediate thing is the audio.  I play a lot of games and New World  easily has the best sound I've ever heard.  In the initial rush of beta  with tons of players chopping down trees, breaking up rocks, and  shooting turkeys the world crackles to life.  As you move into caves the  sound changes enhancing the feeling of being in an enclosed area. On  numerous occasions I was able to find other players mining nodes or  firing off muskets just by following the sounds.  Walking into a  settlement has not only the visual pop but the audio pop of being on a  bustling city street.  There is also proximity voice chat which can be  shocking when someone drops that first fart.mp3 but otherwise is  refreshing to not need to jump on a discord to talk to the person next  to you in game.  One of my favorite beta videos is someone who hosted an  impromptu guitar and song session in a local tavern; only possible  because of proximity voice chat!\n\n## Fun Combat and New Content\n\nCombat  changed from the preview event and in my opinion it changed for the  better.  Stagger is gone so you no longer get \"stun locked\" and fights  don't revolve around who gets the first stagger hit in.  There is some  debate about whether stagger could have been preserved, but I am  personally glad it is gone.  New weapons were added; specifically I  tried out the spear, rapier, and ice gauntlet.  All three felt good and  brought new play styles; ice gauntlet bringing some more \"magic\" to the  game.  I mostly played rapier/musket and spear/musket before I changed  to great axe/lifestaff towards the end of beta.\n\nWith trying out  life staff I got my first try at playing a healer in New World.  It is a  very unique experience compared to tab-targeted MMO healing and  ironically it brings some tab-targeting into New World's action combat.   There is a slew of unique control settings specific to healing; one of  which is to enable tab targeting your own group members.  I didn't quite  figure out the tab targeting but didn't really need to as area of  effect healing was sufficient and I was not healing for any dungeon  runs.  Healing felt a little too strong as a solo player; if you max  your constitution and use life staff you are basically invincible inside  your healing circles.\n\nDungeons (known as Expeditions) were not in  the preview event and were brand new to the closed beta.  I only  completed Armine Expedition (several times) and it was a straight  forward beat em up; as long as you have a healer you completed it.   Rewards were mediocre; just random gear I ended up salvaging (which is  what I do with the majority of gear rewards).  There is a repeatable  quest each time you run Armine; the first time rewarding a unique dog  pet for putting in your house and then giving a bucket load of  experience for each completion.  It is good to see new content in New  World, but work is still needed to make the expeditions more engaging  and difficult.  Hopefully the higher level expeditions offer more  challenge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Crafting and the economy\n\nCrafting  is in a good spot mechanically and seemed about the same as the preview  event (i.e. I couldn't tell anything much changed).  There is a ton to  craft and that lets you make use of all of the stuff you are collecting  throughout your journey.  There is crafting quests as part of the town  project boards (that help level up the settlements) which were great  crafting experience and great leveling experience.  The only areas I am  concerned about crafting are:\n\n1.  Gear  drops like candy from quests and killing monsters (the good ole' kill a  wolf and get a battle axe) and also there is great gear available from  the faction vendors so there is not a market for crafted gear.\n2. Gear  never breaks and leaves the game so once folks have their end game gear  I am not sure where demand will come from for crafted gear.\n3. Everyone  can do every craft so you can be self sufficient for consumable goods  and components.  There will always be lazy buyers who don't want to do  it themselves, but there is no way for a crafter to really make their  mark.\n\nIf there is one thing Crowfall did well it was  making a dependent  crafting system where players had to work together to produce end goods  and thus crafters fit into their expertise areas.  Crowfall also ensured  that items leave the economy by permanently breaking at some point and  thus drive demand for new crafted goods.  New World has to drive more in  that direction or crafting won't be its own area for folks to focus on  which will be a miss for this game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  economy (or market) of the game was hard to judge in closed beta, but  that was expected since progress wasn't permanent.  Early on, it was  easy to sell off some stuff like weapons as players looked to play with  the new toys that came with closed beta, but that market closed up quick  once folks realized everything drops weapons/gear and you will have  more than your fair share of it before long.  Having played on a few  different servers in different starting areas there is differences on  what materials are readily abundant in each area of the map so that felt  good that you different regions will hopefully have different prices  for goods.\n\nWith that mention of regional differences one thing  that definitely changed since preview is the ease of acquiring Azoth  which is a limited currency (you can only store up to 1,000 at any given  time).  It is primarily used for \"fast travel\" across the world and to  aid in crafting.  In preview it was very rare so fast travel was not a  regular option; moving goods from region to region required huffing it  out on foot (there are no mounts).  You had to be a dedicated market  mover to take advantage of price fluctuations per region.  With Azoth  being more plentiful fast travel is on the menu.  The more inventory you  have the more costly it is to travel so there is some checks in place  on mass movement of stuff.  You can also move items between storage in  each area for a small amount of gold per item (prohibitive on large  quantities; useful for single items). With these changes it is now more  realistic to play the game as an economy player (my favorite niche).\n\n## Player vs Player\n\nNext  up to hit is PvP.  Not much changed from the preview event that was  readily accessible.  PvP comes in three forms; open world flagged PvP,  wars, and instanced battleground.  The instanced battleground was only  available to level 60 players which I did not reach in beta.  Wars are  for control of territory in the game and there is an influence system  that elects one company (aka guild) to set an army of 50 players for  that war.  Wars happen at pre-determined times and unfortunately I was  not selected for any wars during the beta.  \n\nI did have my PvP  flag on for the majority of of my time in beta.  There is an experience  boost of 5% for being flagged and you can complete PvP-only quests for  your faction.  The faction PvP missions were changed to be the same  every time so you are always going to the same area doing the same  things.  These missions contribute to territory control and being in the  same area for everyone it can be hit or miss as far as action goes.   Sometimes its a ghost town and sometimes there is a faction furiously  preventing anyone from completing missions (aka a gank squad).  Outside  of faction missions I had a ton of random PvP encounters; I won some and  I lost some.  While there is item damage on death the repair costs are  reasonable at lower levels (but I hear they get significant at higher  levels) I found that getting killed in the open world meant one of two  things: a quick trip back to town that I needed to make anyways or a  respawn at my campsite which I religiously reset nearby to any area I  was questing in.  PvP kills give a good chunk of level and weapon  experience so it was satisfying to get a kill; though I will admit I did  more of the giving of experience than gaining when it came to player  kills...\n\n## Weapons, Armor, and Experience\n\nAnd  with that mention of level and weapon experience it is important to  cover how New World works in regards to character definition and  progression.  There are no classes or races selected at the start of the  game.  There is only humans and your skills are determined by the  weapons you have equipped.  Then each weapon has a skill tree that you  unlock over time as you level the weapon up (through using it).  You  also gain traditional levels through gaining experience and pretty much  everything gives experience so its not just grinding monsters.  This set  up allows flexibility to switch between set ups; just as I noted  previously how I tried multiple different weapon set ups before  finishing up on a healer-like build.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArmor  determines weight class; the lighter the weight the more you can dodge:  heavy armor can barely dodge while light armor gets a diving roll  dodge.  I think heavier armor also plays into stability of some sort but  not entirely clear.  I am not sure if I'm a huge fan of how the armor  system works. Later in the beta it started becoming apparent the good  PvP approach was to increase constitution which increases health while  keeping light armor to keep the advantageous dodge roll.  That dodge  ability is significantly better than any armor in my experience (similar  to how Guild Wars 2's dodge mechanic was better than any armor or  healing).  I am worried we will end up like Guild Wars 2 where everyone  goes for the same armor types/stats and the rest of the armor is  relegated to trash status.  New World needs to make each armor class  more distinct and make some sort of change to constitution so it does  not overpower other aspects such as armor.\n\n## Gathering\n\nBefore  we finish up this post I do want to touch on gathering in New World as  it occupied a large amount of my time.  As New World started its  development as a survival game the world was positioned in a manner  where everything is collectible.  That bush over there?  Can be  harvested.  That tree?  Can be chopped down.  That boulder?  Can be  mined.  That stone?  Can be picked up.  That dead animal?  Can be  skinned and chopped up for dinner.  Pretty much anything in the  environment that catches a player's eye can be collected and the more  visually distinct the better it is (and the higher level skill required  to get it).  What this amounts to is leading the player to almost always  having something to do; so many times while going from quest A to quest  B I made a dozen stops to gather something.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy  only gripe with gathering is that nodes are static in the world; always  in the same place.  I can understand this for the basics like trees and  boulders, but for the more nuanced items such as rare trees, metal  veins, etc it loses some of the appeal to exploration players who like  to explore every nook and crannie.  What feels special the first time  you find a hidden node feels a lot less special once you realize it  always re-spawns there.  This means high end gathering nodes will be on  lock down by players walking a circuit between known node locations.   New World needs to randomize gathering node locations in some fashion;  this change would make a huge difference for explorers! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver  all New World has made great use of the time since it delayed its  launch and delivered a better game.  The transition from strict survival  game to more traditional theme-park MMO has created a unique experience  that is unmatched in the market.  One of my complaints with the preview  event was a lack of variety in content and the team behind New World  delivered a bucket load of variety.  Is it going to match the 15+ years  of content of a game like WoW?  No.  Is there still repetitiveness in  quests? Yes.  However, what the New World team has shown is they can  deliver new variety if given the time.  They added expeditions, new  zones, and added enough variety to quests to prove it.  New World is on  the right path and again it's unique history puts it in a position that  is not available in any other game.  New World gives the player the best  of both survival and theme-park worlds and that is exactly what has me  pumped to no-life the heck out of it on launch in September!",

Later in the beta it started becoming apparent the good  PvP approach was to increase constitution which increases health while  keeping light armor to keep the advantageous dodge roll.  That dodge  ability is significantly better than any armor in my experience (similar  to how Guild Wars 2&amp;#39;s dodge mechanic was better than any armor or  healing).  I am worried we will end up like Guild Wars 2 where everyone  goes for the same armor types/stats and the rest of the armor is  relegated to trash status.  New World needs to make each armor class  more distinct and make some sort of change to constitution so it does  not overpower other aspects such as armor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Gathering&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before  we finish up this post I do want to touch on gathering in New World as  it occupied a large amount of my time.  As New World started its  development as a survival game the world was positioned in a manner  where everything is collectible.  That bush over there?  Can be  harvested.  That tree?  Can be chopped down.  That boulder?  Can be  mined.  That stone?  Can be picked up.  That dead animal?  Can be  skinned and chopped up for dinner.  Pretty much anything in the  environment that catches a player&amp;#39;s eye can be collected and the more  visually distinct the better it is (and the higher level skill required  to get it).  What this amounts to is leading the player to almost always  having something to do; so many times while going from quest A to quest  B I made a dozen stops to gather something.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My  only gripe with gathering is that nodes are static in the world; always  in the same place.  I can understand this for the basics like trees and  boulders, but for the more nuanced items such as rare trees, metal  veins, etc it loses some of the appeal to exploration players who like  to explore every nook and crannie.  What feels special the first time  you find a hidden node feels a lot less special once you realize it  always re-spawns there.  This means high end gathering nodes will be on  lock down by players walking a circuit between known node locations.   New World needs to randomize gathering node locations in some fashion;  this change would make a huge difference for explorers! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over  all New World has made great use of the time since it delayed its  launch and delivered a better game.  The transition from strict survival  game to more traditional theme-park MMO has created a unique experience  that is unmatched in the market.  One of my complaints with the preview  event was a lack of variety in content and the team behind New World  delivered a bucket load of variety.  Is it going to match the 15+ years  of content of a game like WoW?  No.  Is there still repetitiveness in  quests? Yes.  However, what the New World team has shown is they can  deliver new variety if given the time.  They added expeditions, new  zones, and added enough variety to quests to prove it.  New World is on  the right path and again it&amp;#39;s unique history puts it in a position that  is not available in any other game.  New World gives the player the best  of both survival and theme-park worlds and that is exactly what has me  pumped to no-life the heck out of it on launch in September!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
