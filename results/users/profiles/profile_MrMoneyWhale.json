The non-Salesforce is our org (a non-profit) has a business need to send out contracts/agreements outside of Salesforce and ideally would like to have one tool to have visibility for both Salesforce-launched and out-side of Salesforce launched agreements. Our org is a medium sized nonprofit (100-200 users). \n\nOn the Salesforce side, our experience with Conga has been lackluster.  We use Conga Composer, Conga Sign (that leverages composer), and Batch/Conductor (legacy). When it works, it's fine. Our biggest pain point with Conga is licensing. We have teams where only one person really needs to launch a contract, but other team members need to see the status of the transaction, which signers have signed, who to nudge, etc. For those team members, we either need a Conga Sign license for each of them or create work arounds (dashboard where the running user has a conga sign license, custom fields/flows to update based on the Conga Sign Transaction record), etc. Our agreements are seasonal, so we have 3-6 months out of 12 where we're furiously launching agreements in our current use cases, while the other months it's ad-hoc and about 10% of the volume. We've spoken with DocuSign and they said their pricing has changed to a flat (or per user?) rate versus per envelope. \n\nI can't tell if this is a 'the grass is always greener' scenario or if there are real advantages to switching from Conga to Docusign assuming the price point is the roughly the same.

The superload will use multiple state routes through Blair, Cambria, and Armstrong counties before reaching Allegheny County on its 124-mile journey to the western side of the bridge located on Forbes Avenue at South Dallas Avenue.\n\nRolling closures will be used on various bridges along the route, as well as on Forbes Avenue. Pittsburgh Police will escort the superloads as they enter the city which may result in short term traffic stoppages and delays. Two beams a day are expected to be delivered through August 5. No deliveries will be made on weekends.\n\nThe prestressed concrete beams are approximately 150 feet long, eight feet high, and four feet wide. Each beam weighs approximately 100 tons. A total of 21 beams will be delivered with 14 being transported to the Squirrel Hill side of the project and the remaining beams delivered to the Regent Square side.\n\nBelow is the specific route the superloads will follow once they reach Allegheny County:\n\n* Southbound Route 28\n* Southbound I-579 over Veterans Bridge\n* Route 885 (Boulevard of the Allies)\n* Forbes Avenue\n\nAdditional details will be provided on the specific route along with restrictions prior to the deliveries using I-376 Parkway East and South Braddock Avenue.\n\nMotorists are encouraged to “Know Before They Go” by checking conditions on more than 40,000 roadway miles by visiting [www.511PA.com](http://www.511pa.com/). 511PA, which is free and available 24 hours a day, provides traffic delay warnings, weather forecasts, traffic speed information and access to more than 1,000 traffic cameras.\n\n511PA is also available through a smartphone application for iPhone and Android devices, by calling 5-1-1, or by [following regional Twitter alerts](https://www.511pa.com/twitter/default.aspx).\n\nFollow PennDOT on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/penndotnews?form=MY01SV&amp;OCID=MY0) and like the department on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PennsylvaniaDepartmentofTransportation/?form=MY01SV&amp;OCID=MY01SV) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pennsylvaniadot/?form=MY01SV&amp;OCID=MY01SV).\n\n**MEDIA CONTACT:** Nicole Haney, 412-429-5004",

    "body": "I had been meaning to write a follow up to a previous post [\"The Volunteer Who Wants to Volunteer All the Time\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/evs8xv/the_volunteer_who_wants_to_volunteer_all_the_time/) for a while but neither had the headspace nor capacity to write it out, especially with how COVID impacted my and my non-profit employer's work. \n\nHowever, I wanted to close the loop, especially as we learned what had gone wrong after getting some outside opinions. And it's a valuable lesson to other non-profit volunteer programs…we made too many exceptions to a beloved volunteer to the point where exceptions became the norm for this volunteer. And while we were thinking the exceptions were helpful to a volunteer everyone loved and was dedicated to the organization, the exceptions creeped and bent to the point of over-accommodating this individual’s wishes and whims at the expense of staff and largely on for the benefit of the volunteer.\n\nSo after my first post, I talked to our ED about how the situation was becoming untenable for both me and the volunteer. The tense animosity between the volunteer and myself was draining for me, and clearly not a great experience for the volunteer.  I prided myself on not bringing my ED nitpicky issues that I could resolve myself, but this was no longer felt like one of them.  ED and I strategized a bit about what ‘acceptable’ terms were, and then ED led a conversation with the volunteer. \n\nThe convo between the 3 of us started went south quickly. The volunteer immediately became defensive and was generally irritated the conversation was ‘Let’s talk about how to help take some of the burden off you and create a schedule we can all live with’ instead of ‘You can come in whenever you want’. The volunteer was convinced we were inhibiting their work, and ‘if only we would just let {them} work, this would all resolve itself’. In the end, we set a 3 day/week schedule with set start and stop times. The volunteer wasn’t happy and let it show. \n\nAs their role required coordination and communication with me, every interaction always had the comment ‘Well, if I was only allowed to do my work’.  We put no pressure on the volunteer to do xyz or have a quota for completion, and always communicated any overflow or left over projects can be handled by staff for things that had a hard deadline. They took that as an insult.  \n\nThey would complain to other staff (some of whom were sympathetic, but most didn’t want to be involved but didn’t want to upset the volunteer more), so it slowly became an org wide issue. Within two weeks, the volunteer started bending the hours….they’d arrive 30 minutes early and wait for a staff member to arrive and enter with them (otherwise the exterior doors were locked). They would find out which staff members were staying the latest and then ask if that person can stay until the staff person leaves. The staff were accommodating (another issue) but then started to get annoyed quickly that the volunteer was never ready to leave at the agreed upon time.  Then we had another ‘difficult conversation’ about start and stop times and frustratingly that more or less resulted in me escorting them in and out of the building (because of the locked doors). This was all in midst of busy season, we were short staffed, the winter greys had set in…It was becoming emotionally draining. I was functioning at a high level – and my work ranged from higher level strategy, process building, financial projects to helping load boxes into cars. I was all over the place. \n\nThen COVID hit. Immediately our org paused all volunteering. The department the volunteer worked in was put on pause to allow us to focus on the most immediate needs. However, the volunteer would email myself and other staff members asking if/when they could come in (with some acknowledgement about COVID safety), but ultimately didn’t seem to trust us to reach out if/when they were able to come back. After any e-news update, within an hour, we’d get an email asking they could come back. Worth pointing out they did not have a smart phone, so it felt like there was obsessive email checking. \n\nTowards the fall, the program that was put on pause was restarted…both out of external need but also risking having the valuable/important inventory become unusable (it had expiration dates that while seemingly arbitrary, had to be observed). I talked out a game plan with the ED. I was over-extended with 50+ hour weeks and couldn’t take anything else on and needed extra hands to help with this, so I was desperate. So again, we had an agreed upon schedule, the volunteer was excited to start back and it seemed like an unseen break caused things to cool down. But once on site, it was almost like the previous six months never happened. The volunteer was frazzled having been out so long and having upcoming ‘deadlines’ (again, all we asked was that they do what they can while in the building, and we’d finish the rest). They couldn’t adjust to changes we made in the program to expedite requests and would become so frazzled it became draining to try to guide and coach them. They had made/created/edited copies of documents at home which added to confusion with multiple copies/versions of the same document. Conversations were still tense with ‘if you’d only let me work the hours I needed’. They wrote a letter to the ED asking the same again, but only wanted to meet if their ‘demands’ were being met. I truly approached the volunteer every time in good faith, with respect and calmness, but between their frazzled-ness, frustration, and generally displeasure with not having the range of access they thought they should, it all became oh so draining. \n\nAfter 2 months, due to COVID case increases, we went back to no volunteers. While my ED and I considered making an exception to allow this person coming in, especially to help with end of year inventory, which they usually helped with, I also realized managing them was taking more emotional energy then if I just had myself and another staff member throw some hours in.  And it was fine and in a way relaxing. I turned the tunes up and did data entry…no having to negotiate with the volunteer, converting their work into what was usable, etc. It was a nice change of pace. \n\nAnd since COVID kept on strong through the Winter, we maintained the ‘no volunteers’ policy for everyone’s safety…and in this case, sanity.\n\n*WHAT WE LEARNED:*  \n We talked through this situation with a volunteer manager at a local health system, who manages a significant volunteer pool. What we learned was simple: As an organization, we had constantly made exceptions for this volunteer for *YEARS*. Schedules, access, input into the program they helped in, etc. They had everyone’s ear and used it, and we did what we could to keep them happy including changing how staff worked. Yikes. This set us up for enabling this behavior and trying to course-correct far too late. After talking it out with the volunteer manager, it seemed the only realistic solution was to disallow the volunteer to keep volunteering in their specialty task, but they were welcome to join the regular volunteer activities.\n\nHow does the story end?  \nI’m not entirely sure.  Through the winter, the org maintained the 'no volunteers during COVID' rule. Like many non profits, COVID forced the organization to change focus quickly to meet the local need. And I’m proud of the work the org and staff did and how we were able to support our local community, but it was draining. 50+ hour weeks, consistent under-staffing and under-resourced even though we were pulling in significantly more funds due to the org’s exposure and local work. I left the org a few months ago for another non-profit job, one with fewer responsibilities and where I’d wouldn’t be as spread out in responsibilities. It was a hard choice as I believed in the organization and the work and rose in leadership and influence, but I needed something less stressful (among other things).",

    "body": "Hoping to get some insight/experience/resources from r/nonprofit about a particular volunteer situation.  I've done a bit of a word vomit below the TL;DR, but also open to answering follow up questions. \n\nTL;DR - a volunteer who is the only volunteer for a particular task feels their not given enough time to do their work and wants an open door to come in 30-40 hours/week. I believe they overwork tasks and have asked how much time they need, but the volunteer can't give a number. I'm unsure about how to \n\nOur organization has a large volunteer contingency that perform standardized jobs (sort materials, pack a box, etc). Our programs (including volunteering) are well known and well regarded in the area. Most volunteers come in 1x/week to help out  and some volunteers have been with us for 10+ years and volunteer weekly, others volunteer casually, etc. We have standard volunteer shifts throughout the week, as well as slots during the week that are volunteer-free at the request of the volunteer department and general admin (so volunteer department have some desk/team time). \n\n95% of our volunteers come in once a week, one shift and perform our standardized tasks. One volunteer is in the 5% and works with a specific product line of donated materials. We have one volunteer who is fully dedicated to this program/product line and is the only volunteer who works with it. They're older and have some work experience. Their partner is recently retired. They've vocalized 'this is my legacy' and earmark donations for the program. We've tried having other volunteers work in with the program, but there's a learning curve and it's somewhat monotonous detail work. The lone volunteer doesn't particularly want or trust other volunteers to handle the detail or the process or even parts of the process. They are the type to overwork at a particular task (adjust, refine, modify a template, triple check and then research why it's an oddball, etc) and create systems that are, in my opinion, overly complex and are self-reinforce themselves (lots of cross-checks, paper trails, and overworks). This volunteer also exhibits a lot of anxiety about having enough time to finish every task in the immediate future, even if tasks aren't immediate needs. They don't want any staff help or volunteers to help. They want more time to work. When asked about how much time they need, the response isn't a number and they struggle to say how much time they'll need to complete *xyz* task. \n\nMy role is ops in the organization, which oversees and strategizes internal processing/prep of materials, as well as oversees the volunteer department. My job doesn't directly supervise volunteers (we have a volunteer supervisor department), just this vol because they work with a specialty product line. Most staff know with this volunteer and know that she's very dedicated to this product line, sweet, caring but can also 'be a handful'. \n\nThe volunteer used to come in when they wanted and had no set schedule or time frame, so they would often come in early and stay until the last staff member leaves (and often delaying the staff person leaving to clean up). It often felt and that the volunteer was here 35+ hours/week and it was unclear what they were accomplishing (most volunteers are here 4-6 hours/week max).  It was also clear that sometimes by spending so much time isolated and working, they became more frazzled or went down overly complicated rabbit holes. So we set a schedule of 2 days a week, 9-4pm (which are the org's normal business and volunteer hours) and one half day in the AM (the PM is a no volunteers org-wide). No more staying late or coming early (even if other staff are present). \n\nThere was immediate push back about how the new schedule constrains their work, how they have to plan around our schedule, and that there's not enough time to do it all (which is true on some weeks). They expressed that they're not able to get a ride at noon and therefore have to work the full day, which I said 'Well, maybe it's not a good day to volunteer', and they were livid about how we're turning down free help, I'm punishing them for only wanting to help, don't understand why we don't want them to work, etc. They've brought up how much they donate to the org, how much money we save because she volunteers (vs. a staff member), etc. She is normally very pleasant, well mannered, but becomes upset (sometimes crying) about the set schedule. She has also indicated that when she was unable to finish a project before the weekend, she had a headache all weekend from thinking about it until she could come in 4 days later.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to improve the situation, both relationship-wise and also come to a place where they can feel content (can they?) with the schedule. There's never enough time in the day to compelte every task in our organization, it's just how it is, and it's something everyone here has to manage. The volunteer needs a schedule and it cannot be open door 5xs a week due to staff scheduling, privacy, and simply having non-volunteer days. Their work space is connected to a large meeting room, which is typically OK for general meetings but also does not create a full sense of privacy.",

I&amp;#39;ve done a bit of a word vomit below the TL;DR, but also open to answering follow up questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - a volunteer who is the only volunteer for a particular task feels their not given enough time to do their work and wants an open door to come in 30-40 hours/week. I believe they overwork tasks and have asked how much time they need, but the volunteer can&amp;#39;t give a number. I&amp;#39;m unsure about how to &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our organization has a large volunteer contingency that perform standardized jobs (sort materials, pack a box, etc). Our programs (including volunteering) are well known and well regarded in the area. Most volunteers come in 1x/week to help out  and some volunteers have been with us for 10+ years and volunteer weekly, others volunteer casually, etc. We have standard volunteer shifts throughout the week, as well as slots during the week that are volunteer-free at the request of the volunteer department and general admin (so volunteer department have some desk/team time). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;95% of our volunteers come in once a week, one shift and perform our standardized tasks. One volunteer is in the 5% and works with a specific product line of donated materials. We have one volunteer who is fully dedicated to this program/product line and is the only volunteer who works with it. They&amp;#39;re older and have some work experience. Their partner is recently retired. They&amp;#39;ve vocalized &amp;#39;this is my legacy&amp;#39; and earmark donations for the program. We&amp;#39;ve tried having other volunteers work in with the program, but there&amp;#39;s a learning curve and it&amp;#39;s somewhat monotonous detail work. The lone volunteer doesn&amp;#39;t particularly want or trust other volunteers to handle the detail or the process or even parts of the process. They are the type to overwork at a particular task (adjust, refine, modify a template, triple check and then research why it&amp;#39;s an oddball, etc) and create systems that are, in my opinion, overly complex and are self-reinforce themselves (lots of cross-checks, paper trails, and overworks). This volunteer also exhibits a lot of anxiety about having enough time to finish every task in the immediate future, even if tasks aren&amp;#39;t immediate needs. They don&amp;#39;t want any staff help or volunteers to help. They want more time to work. When asked about how much time they need, the response isn&amp;#39;t a number and they struggle to say how much time they&amp;#39;ll need to complete &lt;em&gt;xyz&lt;/em&gt; task. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My role is ops in the organization, which oversees and strategizes internal processing/prep of materials, as well as oversees the volunteer department. My job doesn&amp;#39;t directly supervise volunteers (we have a volunteer supervisor department), just this vol because they work with a specialty product line. Most staff know with this volunteer and know that she&amp;#39;s very dedicated to this product line, sweet, caring but can also &amp;#39;be a handful&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The volunteer used to come in when they wanted and had no set schedule or time frame, so they would often come in early and stay until the last staff member leaves (and often delaying the staff person leaving to clean up). It often felt and that the volunteer was here 35+ hours/week and it was unclear what they were accomplishing (most volunteers are here 4-6 hours/week max).  It was also clear that sometimes by spending so much time isolated and working, they became more frazzled or went down overly complicated rabbit holes. So we set a schedule of 2 days a week, 9-4pm (which are the org&amp;#39;s normal business and volunteer hours) and one half day in the AM (the PM is a no volunteers org-wide). No more staying late or coming early (even if other staff are present). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was immediate push back about how the new schedule constrains their work, how they have to plan around our schedule, and that there&amp;#39;s not enough time to do it all (which is true on some weeks).

Air transport may have been easy at it was a shared charter with other aid agencies also having supplies aboard. 1 hospital was able to pick up OK, and the 2 FQHCs had a bit of runaround but were able to pick up within 48 hours of arrival.
