    "body": "So, to give you a little background on this situation, I'm from a small town in Northern Michigan and there is literally nothing out there but cornfields and dirt roads. It's particularly creepy at all times, even during the day, but you can only imagine how spooky it gets at night. This happened one summer night on a day I would prefer not to remember back when I was in high school. \n\nBeing from a small town, just about everyone knows everyone. All of your friends live in the area off of some random dirt road that has only 3 or 4 houses every 2 miles so there isn't too many people to meet. My friend group is a pretty close bunch and we all like to pull pranks on each other \\- our favorite jokes involve freaking each other out. Now, as Friday rolls around and our friend Bryan informs us that he wants us all to come over his place tonight since his parents are out of town, the rest of us immediately see this as an opportunity to scare the shit out of Bryan. Parents out of town? Bryan is home alone and there isn't a house nearby for miles? Perfect. **(Side note: Have you ever seen the movie The Strangers? Where 3 random people harass this couple in the middle of nowhere? Yeah, Bryan lives in a similar location to that movie. Nothing around you, miles and miles of just corn and dirt.)**  \n\nThe plan was decided upon by 7 of us. We were going to meet up at a crossroad near Bryan's house at 11pm (I should mention here that there are no street lights in my town so the nighttime is pitch black), park our cars on the side of the road, walk together through the cornfield that leads to his house, ring the doorbell a bunch and then jump out and spook him the best we can. As we were talking about this and polishing out the details, I had a better idea: **I should scare my friends that are trying to scare Bryan** \\- they will never see it coming. So what did I do? I grabbed an old Darth Maul costume from my brother's closet and went straight to Bryan's at 11 instead of meeting up with the group. Sent a quick text that I couldn't make it and they were going to carry out the plan without me \\- completely oblivious to what awaited them at Bryan's. \n\nOnce I got there in my costume, I decided the best place to scare my friends from would be a nearby bush on the side of his house. I thought I could jump out when I heard them walking up and that this prank would go down in history among our group. So unsuspecting, so ingenious. \n\nI'm waiting and waiting and time feels like it's moving by so slowly. Maybe it's because I was sitting in a bush bored or maybe it's because when I checked my watch it had actually had been a half hour past when I expected them to show up. \"Any minute now,\" I keep telling myself. \"Any freaking minute now.\" Just as I'm about to give up and call them, I hear some shuffling out front. \"These suckers have no idea, this is going to be great,\" I thought... but then... **\\*BOOM\\* \\*BOOM\\* \\*BOOM\\***. Someone is smashing on the garage. **\\*BOOM\\* \\*BOOM\\* \\*BOOM\\***. It keeps going. As soon as the banging stops it sounds like they are trying to lift the garage open from the handle. Obviously it was locked so they moved over to the window opposite of my bush. **\\*KNOCK\\* \\*KNOCK\\* \\*KNOCK\\***, each one more violent than the last. This goes on for about 5 more minutes until all of the sudden it stops. Complete silence. I thought my friends were now waiting for Bryan to answer the door all freaked out so I perched myself in the bush, ready to pounce out and scream, when all of the sudden my heart dropped...\n\nI hear a group of people coming from the cornfield directly behind me and it's my friends. Laughing and saying \"shhhhh\" as they approach the house. They just got here. They just got here. They just got here. \n\nStranger that tried to break into Bryan's house... or whatever the hell you were trying to do... Let's Not Meet",

    "body": "Every summer I have went up north to visit my grandparents in Traverse City. They have a beautiful house on the lake and it has been a tradition to stay there for a week or two with each passing year. The house was built brand new but it is entirely furnished with antiques and hand-me-downs from previous generations in the family. I know that sometimes energies or spirits are attached to furniture, although whatever was going on in this house felt like something more serious than an innocent spirit bound to an old chair... it felt more sinister... like it lived off of your fear...\n\nI never personally experienced anything until a few summers back but my mom claims she has been ever since the house was built in 2005. I'll begin my story by retelling what she has told me: \n\nThe has house multiple levels, a basement, main floor, and upstairs. The upstairs extends down one long hallway and breaks up into a den, two guest bedrooms, and bathroom. The main guest bedroom is directly across from the den and the other guest bedroom (where myself and my brothers used to sleep) is at the very end of the hallway. My mom said for the last 10 years she would hear people walking up and down the hallways at night. Naturally she assumed one of us were awake and using the bathroom but when she would check on us we would all be sound asleep. She would hear voices at night, sounding like a man but hard to distinguish, and again would assume it was one of us and would check to only find us sound asleep per usual. This went on every night for quite some time until the activity started to pick up in intensity...\n\nMy mom would get worried about us with everything going on so she would sleep in the guest bedroom with my brothers and I. One night when she was laying down, she heard the door creak open to the room. Suddenly our dog, which follows my mom everywhere, jumps off the bed and starts growling at the air. Apparently this went on for an hour. The next night, the same thing happened, except you know that sound when the air breaks as you walk past a fan? My mom watched my dog's head turn as something broke the air of the fan and a loud POP happened right next to my mom's ear and startled her really bad. \n\nThis would happen every summer. Always getting worse each year.\n\nRecently, I started experiencing things myself. I went up north with a friend 2 years ago while my family stayed back for prior commitments. Everything was normal, as I was not aware of my mother's stories yet, until my second night in the house. While I was laying down and reading right before bed, I heard something in the hallway. I called out for my friend Tyler but there was no response. Slowly the door creaked open and I called out Tyler's name again. No response. The lights were all off in the hallway, except for the bathroom nightlight, and I saw the flickering of a shadow behind the door. I was certain it was my friend trying to play a prank on me but when I got up to check, no one was in the hallway. In fact, Tyler was downstairs taking a shower (there is no shower in the upstairs bathroom). \n\nI told my mom about this shadow figure I saw and that's when she told me all of her stories. Now, every time I go up north, I hear things, whether it be voices or footsteps. I see things, shadow figures and lights that will go on and off in other rooms randomly. But the worst and most serious occurrence happened this past summer...\n\nThe back guest bedroom gets really humid so sometimes my brothers and I will sleep in the den. The couch pulls out into a bed and I'll put a mattress on the floor and sleep in front of this screened in porch that attaches to it. Around 2AM one night, just as I was drifting off to sleep...BOOM! I hear something drop, almost sounding like a table was flipped or a sandbag was thrown on the floor. It startled the shit out of me but my first thought was \"oh, one of my brothers fell out of the bed.\" My heart dropped when I realized that the sound came from behind me and that I was facing my brothers... \n\nI laid there paralyzed in fear. What on this earth could that be at 2 in the morning? It came from the screened in porch, which is connected by a sliding glass door to the den. As I laid there frozen for a few more minutes, my worst fear came to worse. Dink, Dink, Dink. Three small taps on the glass sliding door directly behind me. It was the kind of sound you hear if you were to tap on a window with your fingernails. I have never been more afraid in my life. It was almost as something wanted me to look at it and turn around. I refused. I laid there, praying and clinching my eyes shut pretending that what I heard wasn't real. I didn't sleep at all. \n\nI immediately told my mom the next morning. She told me I could sleep in the guest bedroom with my dog and dad that night and she would sleep on the floor with my brothers (she is very protective of them). \n\nThis is probably the scariest part. At 2AM, just like when it happened to me, she was awoken by a loud thud and 3 taps on the glass behind her... she never turned around either. What is also really weird is that when she woke up, she checked her FitBit for the time and it read \"2:00AM\" but then shut itself off. It hasn't worked to this day.\n\nThere is something up in my grandparent's house and I don't want to go back this year. \n\n\nUPDATE: I was actually telling this story tonight at a family party and it turns out that every single person that has visited my grandparent's house has had some kind of paranormal experience.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every summer I have went up north to visit my grandparents in Traverse City. They have a beautiful house on the lake and it has been a tradition to stay there for a week or two with each passing year. The house was built brand new but it is entirely furnished with antiques and hand-me-downs from previous generations in the family. I know that sometimes energies or spirits are attached to furniture, although whatever was going on in this house felt like something more serious than an innocent spirit bound to an old chair... it felt more sinister... like it lived off of your fear...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never personally experienced anything until a few summers back but my mom claims she has been ever since the house was built in 2005. I&amp;#39;ll begin my story by retelling what she has told me: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The has house multiple levels, a basement, main floor, and upstairs. The upstairs extends down one long hallway and breaks up into a den, two guest bedrooms, and bathroom. The main guest bedroom is directly across from the den and the other guest bedroom (where myself and my brothers used to sleep) is at the very end of the hallway. My mom said for the last 10 years she would hear people walking up and down the hallways at night. Naturally she assumed one of us were awake and using the bathroom but when she would check on us we would all be sound asleep. She would hear voices at night, sounding like a man but hard to distinguish, and again would assume it was one of us and would check to only find us sound asleep per usual. This went on every night for quite some time until the activity started to pick up in intensity...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom would get worried about us with everything going on so she would sleep in the guest bedroom with my brothers and I. One night when she was laying down, she heard the door creak open to the room. Suddenly our dog, which follows my mom everywhere, jumps off the bed and starts growling at the air.

    "body": "It was summer of 2014. Myself and a few friends decided to go camping right before college started back up in the fall. We picked a remote campground in Northern Michigan and made the trek up there. \n\n*I will prelude this story with the fact that my friends and I were intensely debating the existence of God the night that we experienced things*\n\nThe first night was very normal. We arrived, unpacked, set up our tents, and got out a half-gal of vodka. We used to play a game called \"5 guys\" and it consisted of passing said bottle of vodka around until it was finished. We all were pretty drunk and eventually crashed. \n\nThe second night was not normal... seeing as this is where things get interesting. A few of my friends wanted to smoke weed and I'm collegiate runner so I politely opted out of it, along with one of my teammates that joined us for the trip. We let them use the tent and we chose to sleep in the car, since the tent was going to reek afterwards. My teammate and myself laid in his car (he took driver seat, I took passenger) and we talked for a few hours before we started to drift asleep. As my eyes were shut and I was just about to pass out, suddenly he screams \"HEY! Wake up! Do you see that too?\"\n\nI open my eyes to horror at 2:00AM. 20-30 orbs of blue light are zooming around our campsite. Now, these orbs were not little yellow firefly lights. They also were not reflections of any other lights in the woods, seeing as we were deep in the wilderness and it was so late. They were LARGE floating auras with a blue tint. These orbs were zooming past our car and flying all over our site, back and forth, up and down. Everywhere. \n\nI think of myself as a religious man and a believer in the paranormal, so immediately I am terrified. I shut my eyes and I start praying to God and I try to pretend these things aren't there. If I just ignore them, maybe they aren't real. After about an hour of me clinching my eyes shut and repeating \"Jesus\" under my breath, I fell asleep. I awoke and everything was normal. We left this morning and I never got an explanation for what I saw. \n\nI wish I would have taken a picture of this experience but I was so afraid in the moment that all I wanted was for it to go away. Also, I felt as if taking a picture would make what happened real for me.\n\nI'm not sure whether these orbs were harmful or peaceful, I was simply afraid because a paranormal phenomena was occurring right in front of me.   \n\nI researched floating lights in the woods and found a color coded guide for what the different color orbs might mean: \n\"Blue is spiritually associated with psychic energy and truth. It is a very calming color, and many people associate it with spiritual guidance. Some people feel blue orbs are a sign of a calming presence or energy while others feel they indicate the presence of a spirit guide in that location.\"\n ",

    "body": "To give you an idea of why I was out in the middle of the woods at midnight: I run cross country collegiately. This means that I'm supposed to run every single day - 10 miles a day - and I can be particularly lazy about this. When you've been doing it for 7 years, it gets old quick. So more often than not my roommate and myself will put off our run until late because we struggle to find the strength during the rest of the day. Well, it turns out that we picked the wrong night to be lazy. \n\nAs 11pm starts to roll around, I told my roommate Matt that we need to get our miles out of the way. He agreed and we both lace up, grabbed our flashlights, and left our dorm. We live on a decent sized campus with a lot of woods on the back of it and a full sized golf course so we decided to run on the trails out there. At night it is pitch black and can be hard to see the path even with flashlights but it breaks the monotony of running the same routes - and we happen to like the adrenaline of being creeped out. \n\nSo we began our run and started heading towards the woods. Instead of taking the normal trail that leads right through the middle of the golf course we elected to take a different entrance and eventually we realized we were lost. It was still possible to see the clocktower on campus from where we were at so we knew we just had to head in that direction to get home. I wasn't too sure of how to get there from the course path so we just stopped our run and walked directly through the woods and trees until we ended up on another green of the course that I have never been to before. While we were trying to get our bearings I noticed a flickering light in the distance. I asked Matt if he saw it also and he just nodded as we both stared. Slowly but surely, this light got closer and closer. It wasn't long until we realized it was another flashlight from someone on the trail. As I watched the light bob up and down, I began to comprehend what this meant. We weren't alone out here.\n\nThat didn't make any sense though. It's almost midnight, why would someone be 5 miles into the middle of the golf course at this time? Why are they alone? What could they possibly be doing? We were sure it wasn't maintenance because the maintenance building shuts down at 5pm and they wear bright green to give notice to golfers (safety reasons). \n\nSoon enough, the silhouette of a tall man came into view and the distance between us and him was only brought down to 50ft or so. He stopped dead in his tracks and we just continued to stare. This really only lasted a minute but it felt like forever. The man did not seem phased by us and started walking towards us but then made a quick turn to the right (which was where the green ended and the woods began - uphill at that). Right before he entered the woods, he turned back to face us. As he did this, he shined his flashlight up at our faces, the kind of way you do to blind someone, and all we heard was the massive footsteps of this guy sprinting and the heaving of his breath. With that very moment, we took off. Let me tell you, I have never ran that fast in my entire life... even being a collegiate runner. We ran and ran and never looked back until we made it to the street that our campus begins on. \n\nI don't know what that man wanted or why he was in the woods so late, but he clearly intended harm to us. This isn't our first weird occurrence in the woods at school, so I may post more soon. \n",

Right before he entered the woods, he turned back to face us. As he did this, he shined his flashlight up at our faces, the kind of way you do to blind someone, and all we heard was the massive footsteps of this guy sprinting and the heaving of his breath. With that very moment, we took off. Let me tell you, I have never ran that fast in my entire life... even being a collegiate runner. We ran and ran and never looked back until we made it to the street that our campus begins on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what that man wanted or why he was in the woods so late, but he clearly intended harm to us. This isn&amp;#39;t our first weird occurrence in the woods at school, so I may post more soon. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Movement - do pushups, body-weight squats, or a quick walk around the block. Gratefulness - jot down why you’re grateful that you didn’t drink.\n\nThis makes you keenly aware of what happens during the day that triggers a craving, like stress. The movement releases natural endorphins to make you feel better (and forget about the craving). And the gratefulness helps you remember why you’re sober and the joys it can unlock.\n\nYou can also follow this other framework depending on what you were trying to accomplish from drinking (healthier methods with the same outcome):\n\n- Alleviate stress = yoga, meditate, pray, stretch, get out in nature briefly, drink a big cup of tea\n- Feel better / boost mode = exercise, whether it’s cardio like running or a gym session\n- Forget about your worries or cravings = get yourself into a flow state by doing something creative, like writing, journaling, or painting",
