But this creates a weird situation:\n\n- Rich person: 'Not being able to spend my millions is silencing my speech!'\n- Court: 'Yes, that's unconstitutional suppression of speech.'\n\nBut then:\n- Average citizen: 'Not being able to spend millions (because I don't have them) is silencing my speech!'\n- Court: 'No, that's just... how things are.'\n\nHere's what seems like a problem to me - while regular economic inequality might be private, isn't the government actively creating and protecting unequal speech rights by:\n1. Courts actively protecting unlimited spending through their power\n2. Government enforcing this system where some get more political speech than others\n3. Courts defending unlimited spending as a constitutional right\n4. Government choosing not to implement any equalizing measures\n\nThis seems similar to how enforcing segregation was state action - it's not just about private choices, but government power protecting a system of inequality.\n\nSince this involves a fundamental right (political speech), shouldn't this trigger strict scrutiny? The government would need to show:\n1. A compelling reason for protecting unlimited spending while accepting unequal speech rights\n2. That this is the least restrictive way to achieve that goal\n\nHow can this survive that test when:\n- Private financing is literally impossible for most citizens\n- The Court admits money is necessary for effective speech\n- Less restrictive alternatives (spending limits, public financing) exist\n- The government is actively using state power to protect a system where meaningful political speech is impossible for most citizens\n\nWhat makes this even more problematic is how it creates a self-reinforcing cycle: money enables greater political speech, which helps maintain policies favoring wealth concentration, which in turn enables even more political speech for the wealthy - while most citizens remain effectively locked out of meaningful participation.\n\nWhat am I missing in how this works constitutionally?

When you’re releasing a handheld in 2025 that’s only marginally better than your 2017 console, that feels more like catching up than leading.

The Switch 2 does edge it out graphically, especially in docked mode, and yeah - WiFi 6 and Joy-Cons are nice touches. But when you’re paying more for a newer system that’s weaker in key areas, that’s a tough sell.\n\nThe real kicker for me is the versatility gap. My Deck can stream from my PS5, run any storefront, emulate Nintendo’s entire back catalog, and even function as a desktop PC. I’ll be the first to admit these are different systems for different audiences, but the Switch 2’s main selling point right now is native access to Nintendo exclusives.

OP did not just log into ChatGPT, see this response just sitting there with no prompting, and post it. The fact is, you don’t know how much of this is AI or OP. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many terribly formatted reddit post have you seen with no paragraphs and no logical flow? I’d rather them go to ChatGPT and ask it to clean it up for a reddit post than me having to struggle through it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t disagree at all that people are out sourcing too much thinking and trusting these tools blindly, but OP isn’t even making a claim, it’s a question. If using AI helps OP communicate better, or helps him refine his idea I don’t have any problem with that. It seems like the proper use to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We took our foot of the gas, played at the Knicks pace, then lost our confidence and couldn’t recover. Also, KAT went off. \n\nRegardless, I’m excited for the next game. Great series!",
