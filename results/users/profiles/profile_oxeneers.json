One ContentDocument can have multiple versions, so the safer way is to query the `LatestPublishedVersionId` from ContentDocument before creating the ContentDistribution.\n\nPermissions were another problem. The user doing the insert needs the right access — things like \"View\" or \"Deliver Content\" on that file, and in some cases membership in the content library it’s stored in. Without that, it just fails. You might have the perms right but double check.\n\nI also found that timing matters. When I tried creating the ContentDistribution inside an “after insert” trigger on ContentDocument, it was too soon and the related ContentVersion wasn’t fully ready. Switching the trigger to run on ContentVersion instead fixed that. You can also push the logic to a future method or queueable job so it runs after the initial transaction.\n\nIn the end, my solution was pretty simple: trigger on ContentVersion, use that ID directly, double-check permissions, and avoid setting fields like OwnerId yourself. Whenever possible I create the ContentDistribution asynchronously, and that’s kept me clear of concurrency and sharing issues.",

I still think the 47mm is probably the better buy, but with my 17.5cm wrists, the 51mm \"sits\" better and the double battery life is nice to have (not a must).\n\nLet me give you some early thoughts.\n\n# First Impressions\n\n* Not going to be super unique here in saying that yes, it feels **unbelievably premium**. I’m coming from the Epix Pro 51mm and this thing is a leap beyond that watch in terms of hardware feel (maybe it’s this silver titanium casing, maybe it’s the buttons). Very, very premium. And for $1199, it **fucking better be.**\n* **The buttons:** SammyGeek on YT said it best - it takes 10 minutes to get used to them and now I prefer them. The haptic feedback motor in the watch has clearly been upgraded and with the default haptic feedback being “on”, the buttons are so much more…. functional. I always felt like the Fenix 6/7/Epix buttons were ‘hard’ to press for what they were and for how often you use them. The squishiness of the buttons on this watch make sense (given why they did this) and are just a better experience. With that said, it does take a few minutes to get used to and you need to have an open mind.\n* **The display:** Yes, the 1.4” here is disappointing but it’s a similar experience/feel coming from the 51mm Epix. Despite that, the casing is a bit ‘thinner’ in the bezel and looks great on my wrist IMO. This is subjective, I know. Still a great display.\n* **The software/UI/experience:** This is the big one - the main reason I ‘upgraded’ (if you can call it that). I also have a FR965 and I love that watch for the large display, plastic case, and great software. It has by far the best software and UI experience in the entire Garmin lineup IMO, so it was great to see that the team who worked on that clearly had a lot to do with the Fenix 8 software build.\n   * The software and UI here is faster than any Fenix/Epix watch that came before it, and it is more responsive than ever. So many little things like responsiveness navigating between menus, using the on-screen keyboard radial dial, and responsiveness when tapping the screen to wake up the display (AOD off). My favorite part that I didn’t anticipate so far has been the TONS of colors available in these stock faces (which aren’t amazing, but serviceable). There are literally more colors than I ever thought possible. Brings me to my next point.\n   * Cool little thing I haven’t seen mentioned explicitly yet - the watch comes with stock glances/widgets with folders set up for you. I used to use folders but having it set up out-of-the-box makes the OOTB experience much better, especially for newbies.\n* **Watch face picker:** There’s a new system here for watch faces - you can ‘store’ custom watch faces that you build (a lot like AWU, Galaxy Watch Ultra, wearOS, etc). Lots of new complications and tons of data on these watch faces (which we love). One disappointing part of the new faces is that many of them have a ‘blue background’ or other piece that isn’t themeable. Think the stock FR965 watchface’s background. It’s always blue and doesn’t look great with certain color fonts.\n   * With that, the ability to visually see what colors are available, with NAMES that pop up at the bottom for each is a huge quality-of-life improvement. Huge for people like me that constantly want to customize the face.\n* **QoL improvements:** There’s so many littered things throughout the system that make for a better experience and more ‘smartwatch’-ish experience. Much of it you’ve seen if you’ve seen any of the YT reviews of the watch. Better setup menu, better “Activity” menu with “Apps” having their own section, with the notification center (which I quite like) available with one button press.\n   * The swipe down gesture on the watch face to bring up said notif center is awesome. Helpful and awesome. So many great little things here and there that I can’t think of more to mention. You can feel it though.",

I’m coming from the Epix Pro 51mm and this thing is a leap beyond that watch in terms of hardware feel (maybe it’s this silver titanium casing, maybe it’s the buttons). Very, very premium. And for $1199, it &lt;strong&gt;fucking better be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buttons:&lt;/strong&gt; SammyGeek on YT said it best - it takes 10 minutes to get used to them and now I prefer them. The haptic feedback motor in the watch has clearly been upgraded and with the default haptic feedback being “on”, the buttons are so much more…. functional. I always felt like the Fenix 6/7/Epix buttons were ‘hard’ to press for what they were and for how often you use them. The squishiness of the buttons on this watch make sense (given why they did this) and are just a better experience. With that said, it does take a few minutes to get used to and you need to have an open mind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The display:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the 1.4” here is disappointing but it’s a similar experience/feel coming from the 51mm Epix. Despite that, the casing is a bit ‘thinner’ in the bezel and looks great on my wrist IMO. This is subjective, I know. Still a great display.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The software/UI/experience:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the big one - the main reason I ‘upgraded’ (if you can call it that). I also have a FR965 and I love that watch for the large display, plastic case, and great software. It has by far the best software and UI experience in the entire Garmin lineup IMO, so it was great to see that the team who worked on that clearly had a lot to do with the Fenix 8 software build.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The software and UI here is faster than any Fenix/Epix watch that came before it, and it is more responsive than ever. So many little things like responsiveness navigating between menus, using the on-screen keyboard radial dial, and responsiveness when tapping the screen to wake up the display (AOD off). My favorite part that I didn’t anticipate so far has been the TONS of colors available in these stock faces (which aren’t amazing, but serviceable). There are literally more colors than I ever thought possible. Brings me to my next point.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cool little thing I haven’t seen mentioned explicitly yet - the watch comes with stock glances/widgets with folders set up for you. I used to use folders but having it set up out-of-the-box makes the OOTB experience much better, especially for newbies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch face picker:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a new system here for watch faces - you can ‘store’ custom watch faces that you build (a lot like AWU, Galaxy Watch Ultra, wearOS, etc). Lots of new complications and tons of data on these watch faces (which we love). One disappointing part of the new faces is that many of them have a ‘blue background’ or other piece that isn’t themeable. Think the stock FR965 watchface’s background. It’s always blue and doesn’t look great with certain color fonts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With that, the ability to visually see what colors are available, with NAMES that pop up at the bottom for each is a huge quality-of-life improvement. Huge for people like me that constantly want to customize the face.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QoL improvements:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s so many littered things throughout the system that make for a better experience and more ‘smartwatch’-ish experience. Much of it you’ve seen if you’ve seen any of the YT reviews of the watch. Better setup menu, better “Activity” menu with “Apps” having their own section, with the notification center (which I quite like) available with one button press.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The swipe down gesture on the watch face to bring up said notif center is awesome. Helpful and awesome. So many great little things here and there that I can’t think of more to mention. You can feel it though.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Last year, I had a spinal fusion (L5-S1) and have recovered nearly fully from that now. I'm most of all struggling with the mental aspect of everything. The \"cancer\" part doesn't really concern me, but more so the recovery from surgery and having my life interrupted (I am out of work \\[2 jobs\\] for next 14 days after surgery) again. Finance is not the issue, it's the mental struggle of recovery, which I am very weak at. \n\nThe parathyroid issue is such a problem for me - I wake up with incredibly intense fatigue and fight it at work every day (I work 7 days a week at both jobs). I am a new Dad (shoutout to my beautiful 8 month old daughter) and that part also is frustrating me since I want to be there for her but I really struggled with my last recovery (again, mainly the mental part).\n\nWould love to hear from some folks here if possible! Thanks for reading :)",

I'm glad I did it but I've been having lingering back and leg pain during the recovery period. I can feel my back swell up and it causes muscle soreness and aching in both legs (below the knee).\n\nTalked to my surgeon's PA and he acknowledged that Tylenol is good for pain relief post-op but advised that I can take low-dose ibuprofen to alternate with Tylenol. I was complaining that even at 3,000mg of Tylenol per day, I was experiencing overdose symptoms (loss of appetite, paleness in the face, diarrhea, night sweats). I thought this was interesting because much of what I've heard is to avoid NSAIDs as they can interfere with bone healing and potentially help cause a non-union. The literature seems to dispute this ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28283838/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28283838/)) and I've heard from other patients and surgeons that NSAID use in low-doses (such as 200mg ibuprofen daily or every other day) is fine after the 2-month mark.\n\nAnyone experience something similar? The reason I ask is that I have listened to my surgeon's PA and used ibuprofen occasionally (no more than 200mg per day) and it gets rid of 100% of my pain for about 8 hours whereas Tylenol only works for about 4 hours and isn't as effective.\n\nThoughts?

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm approaching 6 weeks post-op here from an L5-S1 fusion. I feel generally pretty good, just started driving again and getting back into the swing of things. I don't return to my office job (that unfortunately is not work-from-home) until April 19 so it gives me some more time to recover.\n\nSome lingering things I'm dealing with is a new nerve discomfort (not anywhere near sciatica, and it is sporadic) in my non-affected leg (did not have pain/discomfort in this leg pre-surgery). I also have general lower back pain/stiffness, which is tolerable. My affected leg just gives me muscle pain and spasms at times, as I know the nerve is still healing.\n\nMy main question is this:\n\nHow did you / do you manage your pain in the meantime before the magical 3-month mark (where it is said to have the fusion really set in)?\n\nMy surgeon told me that my taking of 3,000 to 4,000mg of Tylenol a day is OK (I'm 250 pounds, 6'3\"). I told him that I'm experiencing night sweats and loss of appetite - both tell-tale signs that I'm taking too much. I decided to slow down today and limit myself to no more than 3,000mg a day. He told me that I can take a 200mg ibuprofen pill - which helps immensely - if I feel like I need to switch from Tylenol. Obviously NSAIDs are a big no-no because there is some research out there that says that NSAIDs are believed to attribute to non-union of a fusion. He told me it won't affect it in such a low dose and taken sparingly.\n\nI didn't believe him but stumbled upon this study from 4 years ago which mirrors what he says:\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28283838/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28283838/)\n\nThoughts on this? Should I continue my Tylenol regime or be more open-minded to the occasional Ibuprofen? (Both make me feel 100% and all my pain fades away).",

I am nervous, scared, and all of the above. Many of you have been there, I'm sure.\n\n7 days out from the surgery, I was told not to take Ibuprofen. That has made me realize how awful and debilitating my pain is. So I'm glad to be going through with this. I've been in debilitating sciatic pain and lower back pain for about 5 months now. I'm 34 and generally young - right? haa - and I hope my recovery is good. I'm going to work hard, definitely.\n\nMy one final thought and question for you all is this. I have never been to a hospital before - just urgent care - and I have read plenty of pre-op stuff, but I'm just nervous in general about the anesthesia, the ventilator, and all that. I guess the best bet is just to take a deep breath and trust in the process, right? No visitors being allowed due to COVID was a shock, but I get it. Just sucks to know that I'll be alone for most of it. A lot of people say they put you under so fast that next thing you know you're awake in the recovery room. Hope that to be the case.\n\nI'm getting an open back TLIF done so I will have to share how that goes with you all. Thanks for all the tips, I'm hoping to end this pain - or at the very least, lessen it - with this procedure. Thank you!",

Just sucks to know that I&amp;#39;ll be alone for most of it. A lot of people say they put you under so fast that next thing you know you&amp;#39;re awake in the recovery room. Hope that to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting an open back TLIF done so I will have to share how that goes with you all. Thanks for all the tips, I&amp;#39;m hoping to end this pain - or at the very least, lessen it - with this procedure. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "Hey all, \n\nJust seeking some advice or some insight after a few grueling months doing the whole thing that you're all so familiar with. I'll keep it short.\n\n\\- 34M, 6'4\" 268lbs. Big dude, was 15 pounds when I was born (crazy, I know), 24 inches.\n\n\\- Never had any back ache, pain, or any issues with bones/legs/back/anything before in my life.\n\n\\- I work two jobs and one is at an office where I sit for 8 hours a day. Still manage to get 5K to 6K steps in per day. Get up every hour or so. Other job (2 days a week on my days off) is teaching online from home. Still get 3K to 5K steps in.\n\n\\- October 2020 - went on a walk and felt intense sciatic pain out of nowhere. Googled it. Took Ibuprofen (one 200mg pill) and it went away for a few days. \n\n\\- Got an MRI two weeks ago. I don't have images but here's the impression:  \n[https://i.imgur.com/xQOkF36.png](https://i.imgur.com/xQOkF36.png)\n\n\\- Saw a neurosurgeon in the area and he said the disc is 6mm and you can maybe heal that, but the bigger issue is the pars defect and 3mm slippage, which isn't much at all. He said he recommends an L5-S1 spinal fusion.\n\n\\--\n\nHaving said all that, my pain levels are like this: Stiffness/soreness/tingling in my right leg when I wake up and throughout the day at times. One Ibuprofen 200mg pill will make me feel 100% \"normal\" for 4 to 6 hours. I don't have GI issues and take a PPI everyday (Prevacid).\n\nMy biggest issue is just the thought that I am about to have a kid in July with my fiancée and I am working towards a big promotion at my teaching job in the next few months. But, I am not sure if I really \"need\" the surgery. I have done a lot of research - as I'm sure most of you have - and it seems like the people who go in for fusion are often in excruciating pain. I don't think I've ever been above a 5 or 6 ever before. Most days I get distracted and ache-y pain, and I just take one Ibuprofen and it goes away.\n\nI guess my biggest question is - can I fix this on my own? I am losing some weight (target weight is 240/250). I am getting more active (working towards 8K to 9K steps per day with walks, etc). I can ride my bike totally fine and I can do a hike totally fine as well (with an Ibuprofen beforehand). Or, if I can't fix it, is fusion really the answer? I am getting a second opinion here within the next couple of weeks, but I'm just not sure what to do. \n\nI feel pretty lost on this and my pregnant fiancée is concerned for me and I feel very selfish throughout all this. I don't show pain in front of her because I don't want to worry her but when it ramps up sometimes and wakes me up in the middle of the night, she's asleep and I often go lie on the floor or take an Ibuprofen to get back to a manageable level. So, I don't know.\n\nAny advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!",

    "body": "First off, I know every single person has a different experience here. What works for me certainly will not work for the next person.\n\nSo far, I've tried just about everything for my L5-S1 herniation (6mm) and it started about 3 to 4 months ago and was not caused by a single event but just from being sedentary (despite long hikes once a month) at both jobs I work. I teach from home and I go to my office job and sit and sit. I do about 5K to 6K steps a day (towards 10K on a rare good day) and this herniation/sciatic pain has pummeled me. I have a very high tolerance for pain but the weakness in my leg is what has done me in.\n\nI am no expert with this stuff but I am almost positive that the spinal compression from sitting too much is the culprit here. I am 6'4\" and 275lbs so I am a big guy, clearly. Sitting down too much for too long is never good but my posture has been shit since I was a kid.\n\nAfter finding this subreddit, I found that the McGill exercises (\"The Big 3\") caused a lot of pain for me but the McKenzie stretch was very helpful. Because I work two jobs and have limited personal time, I made excuses and didn't give myself the time needed to stretch like I should. Despite 5K to 6K steps a day, it wasn't enough. It has even gotten to the point that I cannot find a comfortable position to sleep in. Every single position causes sciatic pain and I can't fall asleep unless I take Ibuprofen before bedtime. Even then, I'll often wake up at 3AM, 4:30AM, and so on before I get ready for work the next day.\n\nFast forward to Monday of this week. I spent most of the night after work watching his video on his story (see here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh91C-y8YJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh91C-y8YJI)). The most of it sounded like everything else I've read and heard, so I wasn't very inspired. But then he mentioned an inversion table. Okay, I thought. Let's try one.\n\nOne showed up the next day and I set it up before bed (took me about an hour because of the pain in my back and a lot of the torquing of bolts and screws needed). I used it for 30 seconds at about a 70--degree inversion and then would come up to 45 degrees to rest for about 10 seconds. I repeated that only three times then went to bed per usual, ready for another awful night.\n\nFor the first time in FOUR MONTHS, I slept through the night and did not wake up once. When I woke up, I didn't feel 50% of the tightness and stress on my back and legs that all of us are so familiar with. Clearly, the inversion table helped somewhat. I used it (3) times on Wednesday and woke up today, Thursday, with again, less pain and stress. Sciatic pain is still there but at a much, much lesser degree.\n\nI plan to use the table (3) times a day for the next year of my life - daily. I got a phone call from my MD today who said my MRI needs to be sent to a neurosurgeon for a microdiscectomy because a 6mm bulge is too much and he's thinking I need surgery ASAP. Yet, today was the best day of my \"journey\" so far. I clearly have been suffering from an intensely compressed spine and getting traction and decompression for the first time ever has helped immensely.\n\nWhat's my point? I've heard from so many that the table does not work for them. And I believe it. But if you haven't tried one, it's $100 and it's worth every dollar. I blindly bought the most popular/highest sold one on Amazon btw.\n\nSo yeah, still on this crazy train to hell with sciatic and back pain at L5-S1, but man do I feel like there's hope. I'm probably a year or so away from full recovery, but I am going to keep going with this and see what I can do on my own end - conservatively - to avoid surgery and the costs/life adjustments associated with that.

I bank primarily with SoFi and Simple but now wanting to use One. This is overkill - no matter how you slice it regarding \"security\" - and it is unlike anything else that other fintech banks do. This is too much. \n\nAddress change should be done via 2FA - send me a text message to verify my identity - and if you haven't made any changes in the last 2 weeks or whatever, then just let me change my address.

    "body": "Hey all. Been reading for the past 2 months since I've had low lumbar-area back pain, which has caused mild to moderate sciatica down the right side of my leg. This came on 2 months ago as a result of sitting more due to work-from-home and I changed offices at my other job and the new Herman Miller Aeron I sit in didn't have lumbar support, which I eventually noticed and fixed. I'm 6'3\" 270lbs so I've had some posture issues most of my life (34 years old). \n\nI am going to a chiropractor, which has helped, and doing other self-treatments. I don't want to go the MRI or surgery route (no disrespect!) but don't want to take medicine either. My main question for you all is there's obviously a lot of research out there about daily ibuprofen intake but I find myself 100% free of pain and discomfort when I take a 200mg ibuprofen tablet in the morning and a 200mg ibuprofen tablet in the evening. It lasts for a good 4 to 6 hours and it's literally as if I'm back to 'normal'.\n\nDays like today, I try to avoid taking ibuprofen because I don't want to overdo it or build a tolerance. I'm aware of the FDA max of 2,400mg per day, but I also can 'do' without taking the NSAID. It's just so wild that it takes away all the pain and discomfort with just one 200mg tablet.\n\nShould I keep taking the tablet (400mg max per day) while I work with the chiropractor and do other active-related treatments? Or is it best to stay away? My PCP gave me Gabapentin 300mg but I haven't taken any yet because it's never been that severe (maybe I'm tough? I dunno).",

I have looked into this and it seems to be a faulty part on the board. I'm not sure. I got around this by simply charging the battery in-camera.**\n\nI lost the lens cap but have had this UV filter on it since day 1. Lens is pristine.

One tiny scratch on top right of display in corner - not noticeable (see last photo). ***Camera is sold as is***.\n\nI am including an extra battery and charger (2 batteries total, non-OEM).
