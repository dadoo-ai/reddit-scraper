A seamless transition builds user trust.\n4. **Personalize the Experience**\n   * Use user context (role, department, or profile) to tailor answers. For example, HR-related queries for HR staff vs. Sales queries for Sales teams.\n5. **Automate Routine Actions**\n   * Go beyond Q&amp;A by connecting to flows: updating a record, creating a ticket, or checking status.

Clear reporting on “who can actually do what” is invaluable.\n* **Proactive Monitoring** – Instead of just surfacing logs, flagging anomalies (e.g., sudden spike in errors, governor limits hit, unusual login patterns).\n\nIf I had a “magic wand” feature, it would be a single view that correlates logs, deployments, and config changes so I can see not just *what broke*, but also *why*.\n\nExcited to see where you take OrgSense—this could fill a big gap for admins and architects alike.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really interesting space you’re tackling here 👏. From my experience, the biggest ongoing challenge with Salesforce org audits isn’t just &lt;em&gt;collecting&lt;/em&gt; the data, it’s making it actionable. A few areas where tools often fall short:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Config Drift Awareness&lt;/strong&gt; – Knowing what’s changed across sandboxes vs prod without having to manually diff metadata.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security &amp;amp; Access Visibility&lt;/strong&gt; – Permission sets, profiles, and FLS can get messy fast. Clear reporting on “who can actually do what” is invaluable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; – Instead of just surfacing logs, flagging anomalies (e.g., sudden spike in errors, governor limits hit, unusual login patterns).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I had a “magic wand” feature, it would be a single view that correlates logs, deployments, and config changes so I can see not just &lt;em&gt;what broke&lt;/em&gt;, but also &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excited to see where you take OrgSense—this could fill a big gap for admins and architects alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Marketing Cloud, sending to multiple audiences is easier when you structure them with a shared sendable data extension and use a filtered data extension for each media list. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;GetOnCRM Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;, we often recommend this over switching to Lists, as DEs offer more scalability, segmentation, and integration options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can then combine filters or create a send audience that merges your sustainability, local, and other targeted lists into one send without duplicating contacts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
