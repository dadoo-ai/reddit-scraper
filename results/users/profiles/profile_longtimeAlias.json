The surface area that recognizes this gesture has been sharply reduced. Normally it's not a problem. Where it is a problem, though, is when you swipe down to search, for example, and enter the first few letters of the name of the app that you need to open. It used to be that you could swipe down in order to easily access the results at the top of the screen.\n\nNow you can't do that. The swipe gesture is now only recognized within an EXTREMELY narrow area at the edge of the screen. If you go beyond that, you start entering characters into the keyboard, which then screws up your search results.\n\nI don't know if anyone from Apple is looking at this sub, but please fix this issue and fire the dummy that broke this functionality.\n\nTIA",

    "body": "My landlord was awarded a default judgment for $2,000 unpaid rent in September.  I owed the money in question.  This judgment awarded the landlord the right of possession, in addition to the money damages at the root the claim.  After the court date, I entered into a payment arrangement to bring my account current over the course of four consecutive pay days.  Landlord agreed to let me stay in the apartment while paying down the balance.  Once the last installment was accepted and my balance reached $0, a new tenancy-at-will was created.\n\nAll of this was by agreement and by design.  I have email exchanges that confirm the terms of the agreement, and a ledger balance from the property management office showing that I fulfilled my end of the bargain on October 25.  Massachusetts law is fairly explicit that the judgment for possession was null and void once the new tenancy was established.\n\nFast forward to late November, when one of the windows in my unit swiveled off its tracks during a windstorm and blew open, knocking my flat panel onto the floor.  I have been complaining about identical issues with three of six windows in my unit (basically they do not close and seal properly) since I moved into this apartment in February 2013.  When I got home that night and saw what had happened to my television set, I sent another email asking for the landlord to repair the problem.\n\nUnknown to me, the next day, the landlord went to court and requested an order of execution against the September judgment for possession.  This entire matter had been settled for over one month by that point.  I was in the apartment under an entirely new tenancy.  Technically, the landlord was supposed to report the judgment satisfied to the court, thereby closing the matter.  Instead, when I complained about the faulty windows in writing, the landlord's office agent went to court and swore out papers stating that I had not paid the judgment amount and requested a writ of execution which, when presented to the constable, would leave me 48 hours away from being evicted.  Then they sat on this writ of execution for two months, all the while doing nothing about the defective windows in my unit, despite further complaints by me in writing and over the phone.  (I won't go into the outrageous costs required to heat this apartment, given that half of its windows have a quarter inch gap when fully closed.)\n\nFinally, at the end of December, I told the office that I was withholding rent until the problem was addressed.  Four days after that, when I made good on the promise and withheld January rent, the landlord presented the writ of execution to the constable, and the constable served me with 48 hour notice of eviction.\n\nThis was all dismissed when I went to court and requested an emergency restraining order. So I am still in the unit.  The windows still have not been fixed... although the landlord did finally send someone by to look at the issue on the very day that I got the court order quashing their writ of execution (they are waiting on parts before they can fix the issue).  But more importantly, I am still furious.\n\nMy question is: Isn't it illegal to present an invalid order of execution to a constable and attempt to use that to have me removed from my apartment in response to a legitimate habitability issue?\n\nI had to take a full day off from work to deal with the problem, leaving me out of pocket for a full day's PTO (or one day's lost salary).  Should I take my landlord to court?  Can any lawyers tell me what theories I might be able to recover under?  Retaliation?  Quiet Enjoyment?  Consumer Protection?  Self-Help Eviction?",

This entire matter had been settled for over one month by that point.  I was in the apartment under an entirely new tenancy.  Technically, the landlord was supposed to report the judgment satisfied to the court, thereby closing the matter.  Instead, when I complained about the faulty windows in writing, the landlord&amp;#39;s office agent went to court and swore out papers stating that I had not paid the judgment amount and requested a writ of execution which, when presented to the constable, would leave me 48 hours away from being evicted.  Then they sat on this writ of execution for two months, all the while doing nothing about the defective windows in my unit, despite further complaints by me in writing and over the phone.  (I won&amp;#39;t go into the outrageous costs required to heat this apartment, given that half of its windows have a quarter inch gap when fully closed.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the end of December, I told the office that I was withholding rent until the problem was addressed.  Four days after that, when I made good on the promise and withheld January rent, the landlord presented the writ of execution to the constable, and the constable served me with 48 hour notice of eviction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was all dismissed when I went to court and requested an emergency restraining order. So I am still in the unit.  The windows still have not been fixed... although the landlord did finally send someone by to look at the issue on the very day that I got the court order quashing their writ of execution (they are waiting on parts before they can fix the issue).  But more importantly, I am still furious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is: Isn&amp;#39;t it illegal to present an invalid order of execution to a constable and attempt to use that to have me removed from my apartment in response to a legitimate habitability issue?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to take a full day off from work to deal with the problem, leaving me out of pocket for a full day&amp;#39;s PTO (or one day&amp;#39;s lost salary).  Should I take my landlord to court?  Can any lawyers tell me what theories I might be able to recover under?  Retaliation?  Quiet Enjoyment?  Consumer Protection?  Self-Help Eviction?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
