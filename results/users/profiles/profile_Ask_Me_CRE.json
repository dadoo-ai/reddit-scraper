I started FFXIV a week ago after 15 years away from MMOs.\n\nI’m now a level 35 Bard but I’m not feeling good. \n\nMy sessions are short so I stick to main quests and a few dungeons with PUGs who sprint ahead. The story is great but I often skip cutscenes to keep the pace. I joined a friendly Free Company but it still feels like solo play. \n\nMaybe be it’s just my time limits that won’t allow me to enjoy the game…\n\nBack in Lineage 2 I lived for huge raids with rare loot, and clan wars. I’d love to find that same epic teamwork here… any tips on group content or social FCs that nail the raid-day vibe would be awesome!\n\nThanks and see you in Eorzea!",
