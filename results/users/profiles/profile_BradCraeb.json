    "title": "I simulated tens of thousands of ranked matches to study LP inflation and here's what I learned",
    "communityName": "r/StreetFighter",
    "parsedCommunityName": "StreetFighter",
    "body": "So, some quick background.  I, like everyone else saw that post where Broski was fighting a completely bonkers Ryu in Diamond.  When I looked at this guy's profile, I noticed that he had 26,000 games played and a 42% win rate, which got me thinking a couple of things:\n\n* You get 65-70 points for a win in platinum (or at least I did when I was taking my Dhalsim for a spin today over 30 or so games) and -40 points for a loss.  This means that over a long enough time frame, the fractional advantage that you get can become quite noticeable.  How large is this effect?\n* How many games can you lose under those circumstances and still (roughly) maintain your rank.\n\nTo this end, I wrote a small amount of code to simulate tens of thousands of ranked matches in order to get a little more insight on this.  The rules of the simulation work as follows:\n\n1. The bot begins the simulation at 13,000 LP (Platinum 1)\n2. The bot begins with a 50% win rate in platinum one.\n3. As the bot wins, it gains between 65 and 70 LP. As it loses, it loses 40 LP.\n4. The bot is incapable of getting better.  As it goes up in rank, it loses more and more games.  As it goes down in rank, it wins more and more games.  I changed this variable for the different simulations, as I have no really good data on how often players of lower rank beat players of higher rank.\n5. The simulation runs for 10,000 matches (arbitrary, but it turns out that this is MORE than enough)\n\n**Simulation 1 - Chance of winning goes down 2.5% with each rank up (1200 LP)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kgikzc5m1zge1.png?width=1060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127885cd0ef25c813802ce0f0621c1b0c065a212\n\nIn this scenario, the bot starts winning 50% of its games, and as it ranks up, that chance of winning goes down 2.5% for each rank it goes up.  For example, by the time this bot goes up to Platinum 4, it has a 40% chance of winning. These chances are proportional, so it doesn't have to achieve the next rank in order to affect the rates.\n\nWhat I saw is that, it reached the pinnacle of its Ranked climb after 2834 matches (21070 LP - Nearly Diamond 3) and spent the remainder of the simulation bouncing between Diamond 3 and Platinum 5.  The overall win rate went from 50% at the beginning to 38% after 5,000 games and remained there for the rest of the simulation.\n\n**Simulation 2 - Chance of winning goes down 5% with each rank up**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5p39zwx2zge1.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba0cbe20480b7d8636553069b63932227728208d\n\nIn this scenario, the bot loses 5% win chance with every rank it goes up.  It hits 40% win rate at Platinum 3 and a 30% win rate at Diamond 1.  In this simulation, the peak was reached after 2169 matches - a point total of 17155 (Platinum 4) - where it than bounced around between Platinum 4 and Platinum 2.  Again, the equilibrium win rate was 38%.\n\n**Simulation 3 - Chance of winning goes down 10% with each rank up**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohncxq5f4zge1.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aef69354a040c75f8c9533f13af612a54817b86\n\nThis is the most extreme case.  In this scenario, the bot begins getting his skull caved in immediately.  By the time he reaches platinum 2, he's down to a 40% win rate.  If he makes it to platinum 3, he's looking at a 30% win rate and by the time he makes it all the way to Diamond 1, he will never win a single match.  In this way, he is much like you, dear reader.\n\nWhat we see again, is a first peak of 15415 (Platinum 3) after 1775 games and a second peak of 15480 and then a third peak of 15620.  Again, the range of homeostasis here is between Platinum 3 and Platinum 1 with a win rate AGAIN of 38%.\n\n**So what conclusions can we draw about this data set?**\n\n* There is some kind of rank inflation that happens as you play an extreme amount of games.  Probably close to 2000 matches.  This makes sense, because of the different values associated with a win or a loss.\n* As you play, if you're not improving you will rise to the level of your own incompetence.  You will get to a point where you are losing about 38% of your games.  Lose more than that and you'll rank down, win more than that and you'll rank up in the long term, but remember, in the long term we are all dead.\n* There is a tremendous amount of noise in these simulations even though it is a bot whose inputs are being carefully managed.  At every level, the bot reaches a point where it's win rate isn't going to change very much.  Even so, the bot ranks up and down over thousands of games when it is roughly winning the same amount.  You are not a bot, you are a person in the real world with even more random chance.  Life is chaos. Don't tie your ego to your rank, as it is an incredibly imperfect judge of your true skill.\n\n**Edit - Different Win Amounts for Non-Masters level Players**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lu2e7vssgzge1.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3e2828ac43126937d8aaf61d18dd7378cef0f8\n\nIt was pointed out to me that when you haven't been to master rank yet, the LP gain for wins starts at 50 points.  When you change these parameters to between 50 and 65 points per win, the equilibrium point in actually about **41.25%** for a player who has never made it to master rank.  In this sample, the bot still made it to 16725 LP or Platinum 4!",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, some quick background.  I, like everyone else saw that post where Broski was fighting a completely bonkers Ryu in Diamond.  When I looked at this guy&amp;#39;s profile, I noticed that he had 26,000 games played and a 42% win rate, which got me thinking a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You get 65-70 points for a win in platinum (or at least I did when I was taking my Dhalsim for a spin today over 30 or so games) and -40 points for a loss.  This means that over a long enough time frame, the fractional advantage that you get can become quite noticeable.  How large is this effect?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many games can you lose under those circumstances and still (roughly) maintain your rank.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this end, I wrote a small amount of code to simulate tens of thousands of ranked matches in order to get a little more insight on this.  The rules of the simulation work as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The bot begins the simulation at 13,000 LP (Platinum 1)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The bot begins with a 50% win rate in platinum one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As the bot wins, it gains between 65 and 70 LP. As it loses, it loses 40 LP.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The bot is incapable of getting better.  As it goes up in rank, it loses more and more games.  As it goes down in rank, it wins more and more games.  I changed this variable for the different simulations, as I have no really good data on how often players of lower rank beat players of higher rank.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The simulation runs for 10,000 matches (arbitrary, but it turns out that this is MORE than enough)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simulation 1 - Chance of winning goes down 2.5% with each rank up (1200 LP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kgikzc5m1zge1.png?width=1060&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=127885cd0ef25c813802ce0f0621c1b0c065a212\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/kgikzc5m1zge1.png?width=1060&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=127885cd0ef25c813802ce0f0621c1b0c065a212&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the bot starts winning 50% of its games, and as it ranks up, that chance of winning goes down 2.5% for each rank it goes up.  For example, by the time this bot goes up to Platinum 4, it has a 40% chance of winning. These chances are proportional, so it doesn&amp;#39;t have to achieve the next rank in order to affect the rates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I saw is that, it reached the pinnacle of its Ranked climb after 2834 matches (21070 LP - Nearly Diamond 3) and spent the remainder of the simulation bouncing between Diamond 3 and Platinum 5.  The overall win rate went from 50% at the beginning to 38% after 5,000 games and remained there for the rest of the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simulation 2 - Chance of winning goes down 5% with each rank up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j5p39zwx2zge1.png?width=916&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ba0cbe20480b7d8636553069b63932227728208d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/j5p39zwx2zge1.png?width=916&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ba0cbe20480b7d8636553069b63932227728208d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the bot loses 5% win chance with every rank it goes up.  It hits 40% win rate at Platinum 3 and a 30% win rate at Diamond 1.  In this simulation, the peak was reached after 2169 matches - a point total of 17155 (Platinum 4) - where it than bounced around between Platinum 4 and Platinum 2.  Again, the equilibrium win rate was 38%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simulation 3 - Chance of winning goes down 10% with each rank up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ohncxq5f4zge1.png?width=916&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7aef69354a040c75f8c9533f13af612a54817b86\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ohncxq5f4zge1.png?width=916&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7aef69354a040c75f8c9533f13af612a54817b86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the most extreme case.  In this scenario, the bot begins getting his skull caved in immediately.  By the time he reaches platinum 2, he&amp;#39;s down to a 40% win rate.  If he makes it to platinum 3, he&amp;#39;s looking at a 30% win rate and by the time he makes it all the way to Diamond 1, he will never win a single match.  In this way, he is much like you, dear reader.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we see again, is a first peak of 15415 (Platinum 3) after 1775 games and a second peak of 15480 and then a third peak of 15620.  Again, the range of homeostasis here is between Platinum 3 and Platinum 1 with a win rate AGAIN of 38%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what conclusions can we draw about this data set?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is some kind of rank inflation that happens as you play an extreme amount of games.  Probably close to 2000 matches.  This makes sense, because of the different values associated with a win or a loss.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As you play, if you&amp;#39;re not improving you will rise to the level of your own incompetence.  You will get to a point where you are losing about 38% of your games.  Lose more than that and you&amp;#39;ll rank down, win more than that and you&amp;#39;ll rank up in the long term, but remember, in the long term we are all dead.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is a tremendous amount of noise in these simulations even though it is a bot whose inputs are being carefully managed.  At every level, the bot reaches a point where it&amp;#39;s win rate isn&amp;#39;t going to change very much.  Even so, the bot ranks up and down over thousands of games when it is roughly winning the same amount.  You are not a bot, you are a person in the real world with even more random chance.  Life is chaos. Don&amp;#39;t tie your ego to your rank, as it is an incredibly imperfect judge of your true skill.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit - Different Win Amounts for Non-Masters level Players&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lu2e7vssgzge1.png?width=918&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fc3e2828ac43126937d8aaf61d18dd7378cef0f8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/lu2e7vssgzge1.png?width=918&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fc3e2828ac43126937d8aaf61d18dd7378cef0f8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was pointed out to me that when you haven&amp;#39;t been to master rank yet, the LP gain for wins starts at 50 points.  When you change these parameters to between 50 and 65 points per win, the equilibrium point in actually about &lt;strong&gt;41.25%&lt;/strong&gt; for a player who has never made it to master rank.  In this sample, the bot still made it to 16725 LP or Platinum 4!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Even at Master rank, a well anticipated jump in can do anything from put you in strike/throw point blank to a crossed-up opponent or if you&amp;#39;re lucky, lead to you erasing 70% of your enemy&amp;#39;s health in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are some other misconceptions or playstyles that you see in lower ranks that keep people permastuck in platinum?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
