    "body": "USN Vet here. Sorry if this gets posted here all the time, but my wife got asked to rank these items in order of importance for a team building exercise at her job. I was shocked at what their 'experts' ranked highest. I won't spoil all of them, but the shaving mirror was #1. I agree its very important to signal ships or planes, but you can't signal if you're dead. Maybe they have different answers because they're the USCG and can just walk back to land if their ship sinks, but I'm curious what the USN thinks.\n\nWhat are your top 3?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjb653hgs8xc1.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=154f1155e8e30497264b4719911d22e3b890c1f9\n\nDetails: *You have chartered a yacht with three friends, for the holiday trip of a lifetime across the Atlantic Ocean. Because none of you have any previous sailing experience, you have hired an experienced skipper and two-person crew. Unfortunately in mid Atlantic a fierce fire breaks out in the ships galley and the skipper and crew have been lost whilst trying to fight the blaze. Much of the yacht is destroyed and is slowly sinking.*\n\n*Your location is unclear because vital navigational and radio equipment have been damaged in the fire. Your best estimate is that you are many hundreds of miles from the nearest landfall. You and your friends have managed to save 15 items, undamaged and intact after the fire. In addition, you have salvaged a four man rubber life craft and a box of matches.*\n\n*Your task is to rank the 15 items in terms of their importance for you, as you wait to be rescued. Place the number 1 by the most important item, the number 2 by the second most important and so forth until you have ranked all 15 items.*\n\n\n\nFull exercise and USCG answers here: [https://www.airman.af.mil/Portals/17/002%20All%20Products/003%20PACEsetters/Teambuilder\\_LOST\\_AT\\_SEA.pdf?ver=2016-11-02-111101-433](https://www.airman.af.mil/Portals/17/002%20All%20Products/003%20PACEsetters/Teambuilder_LOST_AT_SEA.pdf?ver=2016-11-02-111101-433)\n\nMy top 3: &gt;!I chose water as #1 since you cant survive more than 3 days without it. My #2 was the opaque plastic sheeting to prevent sunburn, collect more drinkable water and protect from the elements (waves, cold). My #3 was fishing kit because it's a renewable source of food. I think I put the mirror at 5 or maybe even 6. And gas is #2? You're going to pour fuel outside your raft and light it on fire to signal for help?

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;USN Vet here. Sorry if this gets posted here all the time, but my wife got asked to rank these items in order of importance for a team building exercise at her job. I was shocked at what their &amp;#39;experts&amp;#39; ranked highest. I won&amp;#39;t spoil all of them, but the shaving mirror was #1. I agree its very important to signal ships or planes, but you can&amp;#39;t signal if you&amp;#39;re dead. Maybe they have different answers because they&amp;#39;re the USCG and can just walk back to land if their ship sinks, but I&amp;#39;m curious what the USN thinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your top 3?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hjb653hgs8xc1.png?width=802&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=154f1155e8e30497264b4719911d22e3b890c1f9\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hjb653hgs8xc1.png?width=802&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=154f1155e8e30497264b4719911d22e3b890c1f9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Details: &lt;em&gt;You have chartered a yacht with three friends, for the holiday trip of a lifetime across the Atlantic Ocean. Because none of you have any previous sailing experience, you have hired an experienced skipper and two-person crew. Unfortunately in mid Atlantic a fierce fire breaks out in the ships galley and the skipper and crew have been lost whilst trying to fight the blaze. Much of the yacht is destroyed and is slowly sinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your location is unclear because vital navigational and radio equipment have been damaged in the fire. Your best estimate is that you are many hundreds of miles from the nearest landfall. You and your friends have managed to save 15 items, undamaged and intact after the fire. In addition, you have salvaged a four man rubber life craft and a box of matches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your task is to rank the 15 items in terms of their importance for you, as you wait to be rescued. Place the number 1 by the most important item, the number 2 by the second most important and so forth until you have ranked all 15 items.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full exercise and USCG answers here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.airman.af.mil/Portals/17/002%20All%20Products/003%20PACEsetters/Teambuilder_LOST_AT_SEA.pdf?ver=2016-11-02-111101-433\"&gt;https://www.airman.af.mil/Portals/17/002%20All%20Products/003%20PACEsetters/Teambuilder_LOST_AT_SEA.pdf?ver=2016-11-02-111101-433&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My top 3: &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;I chose water as #1 since you cant survive more than 3 days without it. My #2 was the opaque plastic sheeting to prevent sunburn, collect more drinkable water and protect from the elements (waves, cold). My #3 was fishing kit because it&amp;#39;s a renewable source of food. I think I put the mirror at 5 or maybe even 6. And gas is #2? You&amp;#39;re going to pour fuel outside your raft and light it on fire to signal for help? You&amp;#39;re going to melt your rubber life craft and die drowning and burning.
