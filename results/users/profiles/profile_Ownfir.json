Full PDF here: \n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20240320.pdf\n\nProvided by ChatGPT: \n\nThe minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19-20, 2024, reveal a cautious outlook on the economy and inflation in response to recent economic developments, including higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures.\n\nKey highlights from the minutes include:\n\n- Economic Growth and Labor Market: The U.S. economy was expanding at a solid pace, albeit slower than in the previous quarter. The labor market remained strong, with demand and supply moving into better balance, even though certain sectors and areas reported very tight conditions. The committee noted strong payroll growth and low unemployment rates, alongside signs of easing labor market conditions, such as declining job vacancies and a lower quits rate.\n\n- Inflation Concerns: The committee observed significant progress towards the 2 percent inflation objective, yet recent months showed firmer than expected inflation readings, indicating a more complex disinflation process. The persistence of high inflation and its adverse effects on households were highlighted, along with a broad-based increase in recent inflation readings.\n\n- Monetary Policy Stance: All participants agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, citing it as supportive of progress towards returning inflation to the 2 percent objective. The stance on monetary policy was deemed likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, with most participants anticipating a move to a less restrictive stance within the year if the economy evolved as expected. Nonetheless, the committee stressed the need for further confidence that inflation was sustainably moving towards the 2 percent target before considering rate reductions.\n\n- Risks and Uncertainties: There was considerable discussion around the uncertainties and risks facing the economy, including geopolitical risks, financial conditions, productivity growth, and the impact of recent immigration trends on labor supply and economic activity. The balance of risks to the employment and inflation goals was seen as moving into better balance, although careful monitoring of incoming data and a readiness to adjust policy as needed were emphasized.\n\nIn summary, the FOMC minutes reflect a cautious but hopeful outlook on the economy, with particular attention to the challenges of managing inflation back to the 2 percent target. The committee's decision to maintain the current federal funds rate range underscores its commitment to stabilizing prices while being ready to adapt its policy stance in response to new economic data.",

The committee&amp;#39;s decision to maintain the current federal funds rate range underscores its commitment to stabilizing prices while being ready to adapt its policy stance in response to new economic data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It did eventually connect and I thought it was a human (you can hear me trying to talk through it) but it was just a recording and it hung up on us. We tried using the call button many times but it didn’t work after that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife is pregnant and had to squat down to avoid falling down. The drops were inconsistent  - some very hard and others not as much.  It was SO scary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have limited cell service so we could not connect to 911 or Property Management. We were stuck like this with it dropping and lifting for at least 10 minutes before it finally took us up to our floor as if nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone at our floor heard us and was trying to call Property Management but they weren’t answering. They were freaked out for us -  they took the stairs after that lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have had many issues with this elevator, which we have always reported to the Management. None as bad as this, though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a newer building - built in the last 10 years or so. It’s a “Luxury Building” and we pay a ton in rent monthly.

Unlike traditional multiple choice where only one is right and the rest are explicitly wrong, you really want to rank the multiple choice answers by which would be the best implementation/solution - then choose the highest ranking result.\n\nSometimes in doing this you'll realize some of the answers just wouldn't work - but other times you realize that while it would work it wouldn't result in what the question/\"end user\" is looking to accomplish.\n\nSometimes the exam will mislabel things on purpose but often times what it does is give you two answers that sound similar but only one of them is the area to go to do x task. For example, they might ask something like *\"A sales leader wants to see the forecasts of another team - what should you do to enable them?\"*\n\nAnd the answers could be like:\n\n* *a) Enable the Forecast tab for their profile*\n* *b) Adjust the role hierarchy so that the other team rolls up under the Sales Leader*\n* *c) Add the other team members to the Forecast Heirarchy of the Leader*\n* *d) Grant the permission \"View all Forecasts\"*\n\nIn this case, everthing but answer a would technically work. Answer a is a trick question bc the premise is that the leader already has access to the forecast tab.\n\nSo then you rank best to worse for the remainders.\n\n* b) Worst Option - now the leadership for the other team couldn't see this team's forecast and would impact org-wide functionality for management of the team.  The leader can see the forecasts of the other team but at a major cost to the rest of the company.\n* c) Less worse option - now instead of messing up the role hierarchy, you've only messed up the forecast hierarchy. Same problem as above but slightly less impact if implemented.\n* d) The right option - now the Sales leader can view the other team's forecasts with no impact to the rest of the org.\n\nIn the situation above, answer A was a trap meant to seem obvious but ignores the logic of the situation. B and C both would have worked to solve the ask but with major issues to the rest of the company. Only D would both solve the ask and also do so without creating additional issues elsewhere.\n\nI see people here criticizing the exam but tbh studying for the exam actually helped me in the admin part of my role a ton. It's not just marketing IMO - it forces you to think about the best possible solution for a given situation when there are many different ways to get there. I use this logic every day in my actual role and also to improve past solutions that were implemented in a less-than-ideal way. \n\nPassing the exam doesn't mean you will be a qualified admin though - but it does help get you in the groove of the type of thinking that you want to utilize IRL.",

I used to love hiking and skiing but aside from the occasional nature walk I can’t get my kid to hike with me more than a mile before he’s pooped out (he is 6.) We have a newborn too. I used to carry him on my back with a backpack thing but now he is way too heavy for that - he weighs like 60 or 70 lbs (95th percentile but he is not chubby just really solid.) \n\nI guess I could ski with him but it’s really not the same. I’ve started to teach him to skateboard but going to the skateboard park means I spend the whole time helping him learn and do not get to actually skate myself. \n\nSure I could dump the kids on my wife but that’s not fair to her either. If one of us wants to do something like this it’s always at the expense of other. Can’t even get up early bc doing so wakes our kids up and/or means going to bed at the same time as the kids to ensure I have enough energy to still do my thing in the morning and then take over so my wife has time to do her thing. \n\nIt was easier when it was just one kid but only once he became a toddler - then we had our second lol. Curious if you have any tips.",

I took on my role in  SOPs bc I started to stagnate in marketing ops alone and found I wasn’t learning as much as I prefer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general I’d say it’s the kind of role you never want to feel too comfortable in. I’ve not seen a single instance where the RevOps team just has everything figured out and running smoothly all the time and has perfect alignment with the business upward and downstream. There’s always room to improve in this role!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Kind of the old adage of spending 50% to get 90% of the quality. That additional 10% improvement is real - but costs so much more it often isn’t worth it. \n\nJust curious if anyone else has had a similar experience and how their weed snobbery has evolved (or gone away) over time.",

Cars runs and drives great, no major mechanical issues except typical audi sensor shit, etc. but otherwise super solid.   \n\n\nOnly problem is this rear door. It looks like maybe the previous owner backed into a tree or something. The rear door will not shut not, like it doesn't latch into the bottom because it is not alligned correctly. The latch sits too far to the right.   \n\n\nI have started the process of pulling the dent which seems to be helping it clear a bit more, but even without the dent I am not confident the door would shut. I've tried using ratchet straps and tensioning them at various points to line the door up and see if I can push it down, but due to the nature of how the straps are attached, I can't close the door without the straps getting in the way. However, I can pull from the inside, up towards the front driver seat for example, and that aligns it but then pulls the door slightly too far forward to latch in place. There is no mounting point (ie. a handle) on the outside of the door unless I remove the taillights which I may end up trying this weekend.   \n\n\nJust wondering if anyone has dealt with something similar and how they resolved it. I understand I could probably get a new door but my concern is that it might still not line up even after installing a new door.

Like *“DAE have ADHD? I am an INFJ and wonder if this is common among us.”* \n\nHere’s the problem with these: \n\n**1) These posts are self-fulfilling.**\n\nPeople who *do* have (or think they have) these illnesses will always upvote these and/or comment simply because something *specific to them* is being referenced. And people who don’t will upvote them because they want to spread awareness about mental health, etc. \n\nHowever, an MBTI subreddit is not where these posts should be. It’s like posting in r/leatherworking and asking if people in that sub are more likely to have ADD, etc. Even though there is no connection between the two, readers will see the upvotes and assume that there *is.* \n\n**2) Nearly every mental health illness already has an associated sub dedicated to that particular ailment in particular.**\n\nIf you have questions about your mental health, go to the place where people who have the same problems as you are at - not where *some* people *might* be. \n\n**3) These posts are irrelevant and non-specific.**\n\nIt’s one thing to ask *“INFJs with clinical depression, how do you deal with it?”*\n\nIt’s another thing to ask *“Are INFJs more prone to depression?”*\n\nThe first is constructive, the second is not because there are *no* scientific studies that take MBTI seriously enough to consider it the scope of how to treat specific DSM disorders. \n\nIn other words, you won’t see Scientific Journals publishing articles like *Predisposition of INFJs to Mental Health Disorders* because the basis of this study would require that something like the DSM *recognizing* that MBTI is a specific demographic for mental health. However, it’s not. Things like Race, Sex, Gender, Income, etc. are demographics. But MBTI is nothing more than a *rough idea* of one’s personality. \n\n**4) People begin to make blanket statements about Mental Health**\n\nMBTI is the definition of making blanket statements about people. It doesn’t make it wrong, but it doesn’t make it correct and accurate either. All people are unique, even amongst the same MBTI types. What’s best for one is not always what’s best for all. \n\nAs a result, people here should caution offering mental health advise or context that is outside their own experience. This includes in statements about other MBTI types. \n\nFor example: \n\n*“With ISTPs you really need to be aware of their tendency to manipulate people for gain.  It’s well known that they are widely associated with the dark triad (ie. Psychopathy, etc.) so just watch out.”*\n\nvs.\n\n*“My dad is an ISTP and was abused as a kid. He was really manipulative as a result, and that lead to me feeling like I couldn’t trust people - especially other ISTPs, as a result.”*\n\nThere is a huge difference between the two bc the first implies something that has no data to back it up.  The second is a personal anecdote which offers context into *one* INFJ’s experience with *one* ISTP. \n\n\n**Basically, drop the notion that mental health and MBTI are related. They are not.**\n\nCaveat is that there are turbulent and adjusted versions of each MBTI type.  That can offer insight, but again doesn’t define *specific* mental health issues.\n\n**If any of you try to argue you better school me with hard data otherwise I’m not having it.**\n\nThanks y’all.",

It’s like posting in &lt;a href=\"/r/leatherworking\"&gt;r/leatherworking&lt;/a&gt; and asking if people in that sub are more likely to have ADD, etc. Even though there is no connection between the two, readers will see the upvotes and assume that there &lt;em&gt;is.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Nearly every mental health illness already has an associated sub dedicated to that particular ailment in particular.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about your mental health, go to the place where people who have the same problems as you are at - not where &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) These posts are irrelevant and non-specific.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to ask &lt;em&gt;“INFJs with clinical depression, how do you deal with it?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s another thing to ask &lt;em&gt;“Are INFJs more prone to depression?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first is constructive, the second is not because there are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; scientific studies that take MBTI seriously enough to consider it the scope of how to treat specific DSM disorders. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, you won’t see Scientific Journals publishing articles like &lt;em&gt;Predisposition of INFJs to Mental Health Disorders&lt;/em&gt; because the basis of this study would require that something like the DSM &lt;em&gt;recognizing&lt;/em&gt; that MBTI is a specific demographic for mental health. However, it’s not. Things like Race, Sex, Gender, Income, etc. are demographics. But MBTI is nothing more than a &lt;em&gt;rough idea&lt;/em&gt; of one’s personality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) People begin to make blanket statements about Mental Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MBTI is the definition of making blanket statements about people. It doesn’t make it wrong, but it doesn’t make it correct and accurate either. All people are unique, even amongst the same MBTI types. What’s best for one is not always what’s best for all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, people here should caution offering mental health advise or context that is outside their own experience. This includes in statements about other MBTI types. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“With ISTPs you really need to be aware of their tendency to manipulate people for gain.  It’s well known that they are widely associated with the dark triad (ie. Psychopathy, etc.) so just watch out.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;vs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My dad is an ISTP and was abused as a kid. He was really manipulative as a result, and that lead to me feeling like I couldn’t trust people - especially other ISTPs, as a result.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a huge difference between the two bc the first implies something that has no data to back it up.  The second is a personal anecdote which offers context into &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; INFJ’s experience with &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; ISTP. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basically, drop the notion that mental health and MBTI are related. They are not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caveat is that there are turbulent and adjusted versions of each MBTI type.  That can offer insight, but again doesn’t define &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If any of you try to argue you better school me with hard data otherwise I’m not having it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks y’all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

On year 4 of this loan, how much will I have paid in Interest, and how much will I have paid down the principal?\" \n\nSo you'd have to create a table that basically takes intial balance of 2,621,000, multiples it by the monthly rate, and then subtracts the resulting amount from the monthly payment to determine principal paid down that month. From there, you subtract principal from initial balance. \n\nIn a formula, I can generate the following month's principal balance like this: \n\nMonth 2 Principal Balance(Bb)=P-(m-(P*r))\n\nKnowing the new principle balance, we can then calculate the principal paid that month solving for said variables. \n\nWhat I want to know is this: \n \nHow can I model this so that could find the Principal Balance of any given Year X using 1-3 formulas, without having to go through and do 360 months of calculations and then mapping them to a table? \n\nCurrently, I am writing a program that simply just performs the iteration for me and then maps the results to the following table fields, and then repeats. However this requires a ton of computations for my specific use case and I'd prefer to simply model it in a formula. I have to emphasize that this has to be programmed (it's for our CRM) so I can't simply just ask users to go quickly run and input said data into excel and then come back. \n\nI read about iterative functions, but I don't quiet understand how I could create an iterative function that our CRM could understand.

    "body": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI am a CTO for a small investment company, and have been tasked with taking over our Salesforce development/integration. For the last week or so I have been reading everything I can in the trailblazers community and studying to take my first exams for SF Dev.\n\nOne of the biggest issues my org is running in to is the use of the Calendar/Events applications. The desktop application (mostly) does everything we need with the exception of reoccurring events scheduling which we just do in Outlook and Sync across. However, the mobile application seems extremely limited. From what I can tell, the mobile events application only shows you your own events for the day, and does not grant access to shared calendars or other user's calendar views like the desktop view does.\n\nThis doesn't work for us, because our reps and our Execs often need to coordinate across many different calendars, on the go and on the fly. After searching for the last week, I am unable to find a work-around. Here is what I have thought of so far:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Prior to me looking in to this, we tried Calendar Anything for roughly 6 months, but hated the mobile view and general clumsiness of the application. Moreover, our execs did not like the interface and the applications takes FOREVER to load on mobile, regardless of who's phone we use or which account we try.\n2. I looked in to creating a quick-action link to the mobile URL for each user's calendar we need access to in the sidebar. However I am running in to issues with creating links to URL's rather than SF objects, and also creating a mobile link to view a shared calendar rather than just having it redirect to the regular events URL for that user. If i'm right, it seems that hotlinking in the sidebar is a SF classic feature but has mostly been removed with the switch to Lightning?\n3. I tried to install a different third-party app called MobileCalendar (or something like this) but it doesn't function as needed (it is effectively the same as the default SF events app.)\n4. We experimented with ONLY using Outlook and having it sync to SF, however this appears to be pretty inconsistent. Syncing times range from instant, to taking hours to populate from Outlook to SF and vice versa. Moreover, not every event will sync and/or display the correct data using our current integration. We are not using a third-party application to sync however, [just the default SF syncing settings overlaid here.](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=outlookcrm_sync_events.htm&amp;r=https:%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;type=5) And even if we could get this to work perfectly, our execs would like to be able to jump directly from an event to a user record/task/event etc. In their eyes, if the org is paying so much for CRM access it the least it should be able to do is having basic calendar functionality- however it somehow doesn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty wild to me that such a large company doesn't offer support for such a basic and critical feature. Nearly every other CRM I have used in the last 10 years has offered this feature in some capacity, so it's very disappointing to see it neglected here. That being said, I totally recognize that I am new to this and could just be missing a very obvious feature somewhere. However our old SF dev. explained that it wasn't possible, and from all the support I am reading online it appears to not be possible either. Is this really the case?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***TL;DR: My question is: How can a user view a shared calendar and/or another user's calendar from mobile?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***EDIT:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/SFGtr has confirmed that this is not possible to do using the default Salesforce Lightning/Salesforce 1 configuration. \n\nu/a_brown_frog suggested I try the inbox Application, however it appears that our organization does not have a license to use it. If it's a cohesive solution that does what we need it to, then we don't have an issue paying for the functionality. That being said, I do have to wonder if Salesforce is deliberately leaving out this functionality to encourage people to pay the additional money and upgrade to Inbox. There really is nothing on the appexchange that enables this and every dev I've talked to says it would require extensive coding....hmmmmmm....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo weigh this out, I did some research and here's more info for anyone else who is in a similar boat: \n\n**Cost: $25/user/month (without Einstein) or $50/user/month (with Einstein)** \n\n* $300/year/user or $600/year/user with Einstein. \n\n*Can we pay for just a few users or do we need to pay for each license we have?*\n\n* I called Salesforce and you pay for only the users that need it, however it's an annual/pro-rated commitment.\n\n*Is Einstein worth the additional $25/month?*\n\n* After researching, I am on the fence about Einstein. I like it in theory but in the past I've had lackluster experiences with AI software and predictive support. In general it seems that they try to make recommendations but almost always lack context to make recommendations that make sense. Moreover, our business deals in acquisitions and less in sales. \n   * The area I could see Einstein being the most help would be in catching changes in contracts from emails, capturing contractor bid amounts, estimates, etc. However, idk how flexible Einstein is. \n   * Salesforce says it's pretty flexible and can be used in many different applications but they didn't elaborate. I have a call with rep and technical engineer tomorrow to get more information.\n\n**Functionality: Inbox appears to offer a lot of additional functionality that the default config does not offer.**\n\n* It allows Salesforce to be used from an Outlook/Gmail Inbox which would be HUGE for us.\n* Also links customer engagement and emails to the CRM which is nice and something our CEO was suggesting.\n* I am still not sure if it lets you see shared calendars but it does let reps share their own availability which would be great when they are on the go.\n   * HQ says that they are pretty sure you can view shared calendars from Mobile using inbox, but not positive.

I got married on July 28th to my beautiful, kind, selfless, and absolute Jewel of a wife. She is still with me today, sleeping next to me. \n\nI can't explain it but I felt like I needed to read the posts here and understand the other side. I thought about every moment I have gotten angry without reason (even with reason) and all the ways I could be better. If I didn't have her, I would beg for even just one more second of her worst anxiety attack or snappiest day. Just one second to hold her again, and tell her that I love her. \n\nI am not established enough, to be honest I am not anything enough right now, but your loss has opened my eyes to the reality of life and what it can throw. I don't want to waste any more seconds being mediocre. I want to be the absolute best version of myself so I can give her the life she deserves to have, and the happiness to go with it. \n\nLikewise, I want to care for my own body and become healthy. Stop eating junk and wasting my time being idle. I want to live as long as possible for her and for my future children. I will do these things because I know now that this time is the only time I will get with her. Whether she passes at 125 or 25, I want to look back and confidently say \"I did my best, like, really did my best.\"\n\nThere are no words sufficient to express how sorry I am for the loss that you have all experienced. I just, I can't. I don't even know how I could. I really wish I could give each of you a long hug but I know it would fall short to that of your loved ones. \n\nI do know, if she did go, she would want me to go forward trying my hardest to live the same mantra. She would want my happiness. I want your happiness and they do too. We all wish each other happiness in this experience, and share the pain together in the end.  I hope I can bear some of your burden by giving back and becoming the best version of me, so she can become the best version of her. \n\nThank you for trying to be the best version of you, however you are.

I hope I can bear some of your burden by giving back and becoming the best version of me, so she can become the best version of her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for trying to be the best version of you, however you are. I love you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "My Grandma forwarded me this email today and I tried my best to explain that it was insane and completely biased. I used citations and what not as well and really tried to help emphasize how much damage is being done here. I'm just curious what we can do to help counter the damage these types of emails are doing. My grandma is very open minded, (very) Christian as well, and very susceptible to online misinformation and scams. She is a lovely woman, but not the type to question authority. However in the past when I've talked to her she has listened to me and many times agreed with my predominately leftist views. My anecdotal experience with most generations above baby boomers is this as well. They are open minded and even politically align with the left, but have been lied to/deceived into believing they are conservatives. \n\nWhat is the best way to target this group of people so they stop spreading misinformation? \n\nEmail below \n\n\"This has been checked out.  We need to PRAY for our nation!\n \nUnderstand what OFA is all about.\nThis is worth your time to read!\nI do not understand how living in a country with its democracy\nestablished over 200 years ago, and for the first time in history,\nsuddenly we have one of our former presidents set up a group called\n\"Organizing for Action\",  (OFA) 30,000 strong working to disrupt\neverything that our current president is trying to do.  This goes against\nour Democracy , it is an operation that will destroy our way of governing.\nIt goes against our Constitution, our laws, and the process established\nover 200 years ago. If this is allowed to proceed then we will be living\nin chaos very much like third world countries are run.  What good is it to\nhave an established government if it is not going to be respected and\nallowed to follow our laws?   If this does not scare you, then we are in\nworse trouble than you know.\n \n \nIt is explained below.  Do your part, read it and at least pass this on so\nothers will know what we are up against.\nWe are losing our country and we are so compliant. We are becoming a\n\"PERFECT TARGET\" for our enemy!\n \nArticle from the New York Post by Paul Speery........\n \nIf you had an army some 30,000 strong and a court system stacked over the\ndecades with judges who would allow you to break the laws, how much damage\ncould you do to a country? We are about to find out in America.\n \nThe ex-president said he was going to stay involved through community\norganizing and speak out on the issues and that appears to be one\npost-administration promise he intends to keep. He has moved many of his\nadministration's top dogs over to an organization called Organizing for\nAction (OFA). OFA is behind the strategic and tactical implementation of\nthe resistance we are seeing across America, and politically active courts\nare providing the leverage for this revolution.\n \nOFA is dedicated to organizing communities for \"progressive\" change.\nIssues are gun control, socialist healthcare, abortion, sexual equality,\nclimate change, and of course, immigration reform.\n \nOFA members were propped up by the ex-president's message from the\nshadows:\n\"Organizing is the building block of everything great we've accomplished.\nOrganizers around the country are fighting for change in their\ncommunities-and OFA is one of the groups on the front lines...Commit to\nthis work in 2016 and beyond.\"\n \nOFA's website says it obtained its \"digital\" assets from the\nex-president's re-election effort and that he inspired the movement. In\nshort, it's the shadow government organization aimed at resisting and\ntearing down the Constitutional Republic.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Grandma forwarded me this email today and I tried my best to explain that it was insane and completely biased. I used citations and what not as well and really tried to help emphasize how much damage is being done here. I&amp;#39;m just curious what we can do to help counter the damage these types of emails are doing. My grandma is very open minded, (very) Christian as well, and very susceptible to online misinformation and scams. She is a lovely woman, but not the type to question authority. However in the past when I&amp;#39;ve talked to her she has listened to me and many times agreed with my predominately leftist views. My anecdotal experience with most generations above baby boomers is this as well. They are open minded and even politically align with the left, but have been lied to/deceived into believing they are conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is the best way to target this group of people so they stop spreading misinformation? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Email below &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This has been checked out.  We need to PRAY for our nation!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understand what OFA is all about.\nThis is worth your time to read!\nI do not understand how living in a country with its democracy\nestablished over 200 years ago, and for the first time in history,\nsuddenly we have one of our former presidents set up a group called\n&amp;quot;Organizing for Action&amp;quot;,  (OFA) 30,000 strong working to disrupt\neverything that our current president is trying to do.  This goes against\nour Democracy , it is an operation that will destroy our way of governing.\nIt goes against our Constitution, our laws, and the process established\nover 200 years ago. If this is allowed to proceed then we will be living\nin chaos very much like third world countries are run.  What good is it to\nhave an established government if it is not going to be respected and\nallowed to follow our laws?   If this does not scare you, then we are in\nworse trouble than you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is explained below.  Do your part, read it and at least pass this on so\nothers will know what we are up against.\nWe are losing our country and we are so compliant. We are becoming a\n&amp;quot;PERFECT TARGET&amp;quot; for our enemy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Article from the New York Post by Paul Speery........&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had an army some 30,000 strong and a court system stacked over the\ndecades with judges who would allow you to break the laws, how much damage\ncould you do to a country? We are about to find out in America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ex-president said he was going to stay involved through community\norganizing and speak out on the issues and that appears to be one\npost-administration promise he intends to keep. He has moved many of his\nadministration&amp;#39;s top dogs over to an organization called Organizing for\nAction (OFA). OFA is behind the strategic and tactical implementation of\nthe resistance we are seeing across America, and politically active courts\nare providing the leverage for this revolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OFA is dedicated to organizing communities for &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot; change.\nIssues are gun control, socialist healthcare, abortion, sexual equality,\nclimate change, and of course, immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OFA members were propped up by the ex-president&amp;#39;s message from the\nshadows:\n&amp;quot;Organizing is the building block of everything great we&amp;#39;ve accomplished.\nOrganizers around the country are fighting for change in their\ncommunities-and OFA is one of the groups on the front lines...Commit to\nthis work in 2016 and beyond.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OFA&amp;#39;s website says it obtained its &amp;quot;digital&amp;quot; assets from the\nex-president&amp;#39;s re-election effort and that he inspired the movement. In\nshort, it&amp;#39;s the shadow government organization aimed at resisting and\ntearing down the Constitutional Republic.  AMERICA&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paul Sperry, writing for the New York Post, says OFA will fight President\nDonald Trump at every turn of his presidency and the ex-president &amp;quot;will\ncommand them from a bunker less than two miles from the White House.&amp;quot;\nSperry writes that the ex-president is setting up a shadow government to\nsabotage the incoming administration through a network of non-profits led\nby OFA, which is growing its war chest (more than $40 million) and has\nsome 250 offices nationwide.

And we are taking it very, very slow. \n\nI can't offer enough gratitude for the help of everyone here. Users like u/cookieredditor, u/Batmanlives (I can't remember his username but he knows who he is lol) and many others have been a huge help. I have contributed and even been a mod on another BPD subreddit- I have had individuals call me and both given and received advise. I understand how hard each of you have suffered, or are suffering. \n\nI promise, it does get better. There is life after the FOG and it is so beautiful. This is the happiest, and most content I have ever been. While I still regret parts of my relationship with my uBPDex, I'm grateful the experience and what it taught me. And also how it pushed me to grow. Unfortunately being subscribed here is a constant reminder of a time in my life that has passed. As a result, I've decided to let new people come in and do their thing. :) \n\nIf any of you ever need help, feel free to send me a PM and I'll always do my best to respond and give council on what has given me the ability to overcome this.

And we are taking it very, very slow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t offer enough gratitude for the help of everyone here. Users like &lt;a href=\"/u/cookieredditor\"&gt;u/cookieredditor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/Batmanlives\"&gt;u/Batmanlives&lt;/a&gt; (I can&amp;#39;t remember his username but he knows who he is lol) and many others have been a huge help. I have contributed and even been a mod on another BPD subreddit- I have had individuals call me and both given and received advise. I understand how hard each of you have suffered, or are suffering. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I promise, it does get better. There is life after the FOG and it is so beautiful. This is the happiest, and most content I have ever been. While I still regret parts of my relationship with my uBPDex, I&amp;#39;m grateful the experience and what it taught me. And also how it pushed me to grow. Unfortunately being subscribed here is a constant reminder of a time in my life that has passed. As a result, I&amp;#39;ve decided to let new people come in and do their thing. :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of you ever need help, feel free to send me a PM and I&amp;#39;ll always do my best to respond and give council on what has given me the ability to overcome this. It hasn&amp;#39;t been easy, and there&amp;#39;s still some C-PTSD, but overall I am back to the man that I was, but better than ever before. I love you guys. Stay strong and remember your worth.

Often times I read posts that make me feel so much love I just wish I could reach out and hug you all. \n\nI'm currently talking with an INFP girl and this is the first time in like 4 years that I have felt this magnitude of love and compassion for someone. The last time was with another INFP. We've known eachother for 2 days and it's literally like we have been friends forever. She has opened up immensely to me on some insanely personal subjects, as have I. Subjects I didn't even know I felt.\n\nI've noticed I'm more open about my affection for her than she is towards me- although she just got out of a relationship 2 months ago and I understand how hard that is as 8 months ago I got out of my own relationship that was abusive and I'm literally just now feeling comfortable with dating. \n\nI'm being sure not to push her in any way and I have absolutely no expectations for whatever we become. I'm  just *so* happy to have such intimate and deep conversation with another human. \n\nThat's all beside the point of this post but I just need to let another group of INFPs know that these connections do exist whether short or long, and they're amazingly beautiful. She is literally the most beautiful soul I have ever encountered in my life. \n\nOKAY anyways. \n\nI've read that many INFPs have difficulty expressing feelings or opening up about how they feel. I find this strange because I don't feel this at all. I can talk about my feelings with literally anyone with very little shame, however they are all internal conflicts, ideas, and expressions. I also find that I have very little issues taking leadership roles (thought don't prefer it) and am generally pretty happy except when I'm not. \n\nI guess my question is \n\n1) How common is it amongst INFP's to be able to easily share their feelings? I know that once we connect with someone it's easier, however many times the only thing I need is an open ear and an accepting heart. I will say that if I feel like a person is close-minded in any way at all I will literally not tell them anything about how I feel. So maybe that's INFP of me? \n\n2) Any advice for making sure I respect this female INFP's boundaries and ensure that she feels safe and secure in our relationship (whatever that entails?) \n\nThanks guys.

As INFPs we love to dream of what could be.

In practice, trying to do this depresses me because it's simply not possible, or it's too overwhelming to try to achieve. \n\nIn regards to expectations, this is further heightened. For example, I downloaded Tinder last week and have been matching with tons of girls in my area. Women that I find attractive and interesting. To be honest, I have really low self confidence for a variety of reasons and Tinder has been a huge source of anxiety for me as a result. I've gone a few dates (for the first time since ending an abusive relationship 8 months ago) and find that these girls are scared of me. Not because I'm creepy, not because I'm not attractive or fun or interesting. Simply because I go into these dates with expectations and project them onto these girls without meaning to. I create these idealized versions of the females i'm talking to before I even meet them. Then when I meet them, I ignore any red flags because I'm so desperately seeking companionship. What results is conversation centered around doing things together in the future, relationship compatibility, past hurts, and topics that really have no place in a first date. \n\nNeedless to say, this leads to disappointment when I *expect* a second date and instead am met with silence, ghosting, or rejection. \n\nI'm starting to think that the \"dreamer\" aspect of me leads to constant disappointment and pain, simply because I'm not in touch with the reality in front of me. \n\nI'm curious what other's thoughts are on this concept. \n\nDo you find this to be true for you? \n\nHow can we ground ourselves in reality and avoid disappointment?
