Release one feature at a time and see if people actually use it. Thatâ€™s how you test demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you wait until itâ€™s fully built, you risk wasting time on something no one wants. Build fast, ship often, and adjust based on real feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easier said then done, I know :).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
