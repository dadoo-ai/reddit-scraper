In essence, Agentic AI takes the GEnAI game further by not only enabling us to create new content, etc. but also make decisions and act on them.  For example - in my world - which is support, Agentic AI will not only find and summarize the path to solving a customer issue - but it will also outline the steps and if I give permission, then solve it for the customer.  In my opinion its the ultimate human feedback loop.  If you've been using GenAI bots regularly like ChatGPT or Claude - you may have gotten into the habit of dialogue - having a conversation where you start with a clear prompt, get some info and then give edits or feedback.  With Agentic Ai, you go further and give feedback that leads to action.  Hope that helps!  Let us know what else you learn!",
