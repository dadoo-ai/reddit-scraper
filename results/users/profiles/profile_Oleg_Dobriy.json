The folder structure is shown there. So I believe that&amp;#39;s the important thing I forgot to mention: it&amp;#39;s not only formatted, but there&amp;#39;s something written after on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does it mean the folder structure couldn&amp;#39;t be recovered? The raw files are there, and as I can preview, they all are almost ok. The folder structure will make the recovery process much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
