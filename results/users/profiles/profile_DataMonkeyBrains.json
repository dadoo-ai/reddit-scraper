Highly recommend this setup. \n\nNo connectivity meant no Spotify so I had to set that up on my account. I'll remove at turn in.  Did love seeing the screen and playlists come up as as it is in my car. \n\nI'm using my key fob with the car and it works much better than the card key.  Wish the car was in my app for the rental though\n\nWish profile was auto transferred with the previously mentioned app access. Big miss on Tesla for not getting this done. Elon said it would get done 18 months ago. \n\nNo access to glove box. No idea why. \n\nRegular auto drive assist functionality needs to be turned on and accepted.  Obviously no FSD. \n\nFirmware was over a year out of date.  I'm updating but Tesla needs to work with Hertz to get them trained on a few simple maintenance items such as firmware updates.  I'm using my Airbnb wifi to download firmware updates. \n\nCar is a std. \n\nSpots like rural OH may be hard to locate superchargers.  Be sure you have the j1772 adapter, 120v plugin and bring your own cca adapter if you have one. Town I'm visiting has CCS but no Superchargers.  \n\nGlass internal and external needs a good cleaning. \n\nNo accessory trays in center console. I miss the forward one. I might bring my own in the future. I like it that much.  \n\nSound quality for music in std is really good but I don't crank my Premium sound in the LR very often so maybe not the best person to judge. \n\nCar really should have an intro/welcome for first time Tesla drivers. Help walk through settings. How to use stalks, etc. Hold newbie hands a bit more. This is a chance to get a rental driver to be a fan Tesla.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off its cheap. $400 (everything) for 7 days/6 nights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No premium connectivity so I&amp;#39;m using my phone hotspot with always on Wi-Fi to get the normal experience I&amp;#39;m used to.  Highly recommend this setup. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No connectivity meant no Spotify so I had to set that up on my account. I&amp;#39;ll remove at turn in.  Did love seeing the screen and playlists come up as as it is in my car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using my key fob with the car and it works much better than the card key.  Wish the car was in my app for the rental though&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wish profile was auto transferred with the previously mentioned app access. Big miss on Tesla for not getting this done. Elon said it would get done 18 months ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No access to glove box. No idea why. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regular auto drive assist functionality needs to be turned on and accepted.  Obviously no FSD. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firmware was over a year out of date.  I&amp;#39;m updating but Tesla needs to work with Hertz to get them trained on a few simple maintenance items such as firmware updates.  I&amp;#39;m using my Airbnb wifi to download firmware updates. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Car is a std. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spots like rural OH may be hard to locate superchargers.  Be sure you have the j1772 adapter, 120v plugin and bring your own cca adapter if you have one. Town I&amp;#39;m visiting has CCS but no Superchargers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glass internal and external needs a good cleaning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No accessory trays in center console. I miss the forward one. I might bring my own in the future. I like it that much.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sound quality for music in std is really good but I don&amp;#39;t crank my Premium sound in the LR very often so maybe not the best person to judge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Car really should have an intro/welcome for first time Tesla drivers. Help walk through settings. How to use stalks, etc. Hold newbie hands a bit more. This is a chance to get a rental driver to be a fan Tesla. Missing a great opp. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything anyone wants me to check/learn/share that I&amp;#39;ve missed? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The folks at the counter say they rent them all the time because they are so inexpensive.

I live in Seattle, WA and climbed my first glacier coverted Mt last year -  Mt. Baker.  This summer I have planned a summit of Mt. Rainier (via RMI) with both of my kids.  I do occasional multi-day backpack trips and have done as much as 21 days in a row (JMT - 2017 including a summit of Mt. Whitney).  I carry a garmin InReach with me for any backcountry hike, climb, bike ride, etc...   I do a lot of hiking and backpacking in the spring/summer months and this watch looks like a wonderful way to track these adventures and my physical training.  oh - I also have a road bike that currently has a Garmin Edge 500 with the cadence monitoring setup.  I haven't used it in awhile but would that link to the watch?  \n\nThe HEAT AND ALTITUDE ACCLIMATION feature of the 6 seems like it would be a great addition but do they work worth darn?  Is the battery capacity that much better - especially with active GPS running?  I do carry a battery in my pack for recharging as needed with my current fitbit and plan to use it with this watch.  \n\nThe HR sensor on my Fitbit is very helpful for me to know when I am pushing too hard and need to slow down a bit.  I try hard to keep from crashing by going out to hard, too quick and find the HR on my versa to be pretty accurate.  I see some complaints on here about HR sensors on the Fenix line and that makes me have some doubts.  \n\nAnyone else with similar use experience?  feedback?   I really appreciate any guidance.

My original Pixel would have been pretty warm after that much time. \n* screen quality is greatly improved - no pixels appearing.  I would see pixels clearly on the original device and that ruined the immersion experience somewhat for me. \n* sound with the front facing speakers is good enough that seperate headphones are not needed.  Of course they help a bunch to not be a nuisance to those around you but if you are using this in the comfort of your home - then they work fine. \n* Netflix VR doesn't bounce around anymore.  I had a problem with the original pixel where the center of the VR screen kept bouncing around.  Netflix VR was the worst.  No longer a problem.  I enjoy the virtual living room of that app and watching shows on it is pretty cool when others in our family have our big screen in use.  \n* one downside - the buttons on the 2 XL are in the same location as the closing tab/string so it's easy to accidentally turn the screen off on your 2 XL or change the volume just by putting the phone into the Daydream.  Just be careful inserting it.  \n* the new Google Stories are very cool!!   I'm really enjoying this content and some of the other new content.  Google stories brings you into the middle of a story. It can be a bit disorientating to spin your head around as the story takes place but I found it to be pretty good.  \n\nAnyone else use their Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL's with the Daydream they picked up last year?  Anyone compare it to the Daydream released recently?  \n\nI'm somewhat surprised that google does not highlight the VR capabilities of the devices in advertising/marketing. \n\nI hope you all had a great Thanksgiving taking photos with your new phones.  \n\n",

This is the second incident where her phone needed to be replaced since purchase.\n\nMy daughter dropped her 5x last week from about 4 feet on to concrete.  The phone was in a case and suffered no external damage.  However, after dropping the phone it now displays an error message about there not being SIM card in the device.  No amount of jiggering with the sim card, trying different sim cards, etc.. would fix the issue.  \n\nI contacted google support via phone call that evening and walked the service tech through the issue and what I had tried/done. \n\nThe service tech went down a path of asking me to verify the APN settings on the device were correct for our carrier (t-mobile).  \n\nThe problem with this path of testing is that the device will not show the APN settings without a SIM card.  So it was a fruitless exercise.  I tried to explain this to the tech but he insisted that they needed to verify the APN settings with the carrier for the device. I went round and round about this issue for about 30 minutes with the tech and becoming more frustrated by the moment. He insisted that we needed the apn settings for the device from the carrier. \n\nso..  I just looked on the T-Mobile website and found the APN settings.  I provided the link to the tech engineer and said - okay - so now what?  - he had no answer..  and he moved forward with the replacement.  \n\nI bring this to the subredit thread because it seems like an excuse for not replacing a device that is under warranty and not functioning correctly.  With no way to verify the APN for most consumers or ones that know less about mobile devices, I think many google nexus 5x owners in the same predicament would be so frustrated that they would just go out and purchase a new device.  \n\nThis is the first poor experience I have had with google techs and replacements.  is this becoming a more frequent problem?  Are others encountering anything similar from google support?  I hope this is just a one time thing.  \n\nMy son had the 5x bootloop issue occur on his device and Google support was great - we had a replacement device in hand at no cost within 2 days.  It was a super fast replacement.  I'm hopeful this is a 1 time thing.  I have a Pixel and I love it and I'm hoping to stay on google devices going forward if their support stays top notch.  ",
