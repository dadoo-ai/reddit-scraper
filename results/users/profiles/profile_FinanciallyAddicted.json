What ends up happening is we have  multiple flows and triggers getting fired all at the same time even for small updates. However when debugging through the logs I did realise some things if someone were to write the same automation logic in Java and use a basic MySQL or Postgres Table with the exact same number of records. It would probably be a lot faster. I understand bad design and recursive calls but I honestly feel like either the cpu on the server is pretty slow compared to my laptop( single core performance) or throttled or the heavy abstraction layers make it extremely slow albeit easier to code.\n \nWould love to hear from professionals who worked on other languages would similar automations take this long even with bad code. Like how is the cpu consuming 15 seconds even if there are multiple recursive calls.\n\nI 100% agree governor limits are absolutely necessary or you can end up with million dollar bills on AWS.

What ends up happening is we have  multiple flows and triggers getting fired all at the same time even for small updates. However when debugging through the logs I did realise some things if someone were to write the same automation logic in Java and use a basic MySQL or Postgres Table with the exact same number of records. It would probably be a lot faster. I understand bad design and recursive calls but I honestly feel like either the cpu on the server is pretty slow compared to my laptop( single core performance) or throttled or the heavy abstraction layers make it extremely slow albeit easier to code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would love to hear from professionals who worked on other languages would similar automations take this long even with bad code. Like how is the cpu consuming 15 seconds even if there are multiple recursive calls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I 100% agree governor limits are absolutely necessary or you can end up with million dollar bills on AWS. Still I feel like it’s pretty less compared to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "This is a long post so feel free to skip.\n\nI work in a service based company and my notice period is 3 months. I have around 4 YOE and want to switch for the second time having worked for 2.5 years at my previous company and by the time I resign 2 years in the current company considering me serving the full 3 month notice period.\n\nNow the first thing well I am fully convinced myself but have doubts sometimes but given the fact that I have 3 months of notice period and will have to absolutely serve it, I feel it’s just better to just resign and start searching at around the 45 day mark. The cons I see are the global economy tanking because of political tensions especially the charade done by Trump. \n\nWhen the recruiter asks how come you have 45 day notice period in this WITCH company I am going to say that I am having an offer with Infosys because Infosys never shares the offer letter until the final day.  Say that I resigned on the basis of that.\n\nI am positive about the interview cracking based on past experience because I have prepared my techstack pretty well. Cracking interviews is not a problem for me usually only face that dreaded interviewer who hates my face 1/10 times can’t do anything about that.\n\nHowever there are three other people that need convincing first is my Dad who was part of the layoffs several times and fears Job security. I actually did the same thing last time but I had an offer in pipeline so I lied that I resigned after the offer not before, the thing with 3 months of notice period is whoever is offering knows damn well they aren’t the company you would join in the first place and can revoke the offer anyway leaving you stranded. Don’t know how do I lie and they want me to take leaves around the time I am resigning.\n\nSecond is my senior colleague who I feel bad for because he depends a lot on me and we are in a critical phase and with me gone he will be stranded. How do I warn him. I have a bonus coming up and I don’t want him panic leaking this to his managers and senior people because then they would screw it up to save the budget. But I want to warn him to properly understand the code base he is really bad at understanding stuff.\n\nThird and the most important I am close with my 5 levels skip senior leader and he already knows that I am critical. He tries to get me awards and stuff just to keep me happy. Unfortunately the Indian IT works this way it maybe in his power to get me a 50% hike at max  but that’s about it. I am earning 2X the people with near my experience in this service based company because they haven’t switched. I feel like he will request me to at least delay and stuff.  I have had to work on multiple weekends without any significant compensation I have worked around 10+ extra days and have 14 days of leaves which will just lapse. I think this is something I am going to use as the main talking point and just ask for a 100% hike given the fact that there is so much workload. My problem is that even if they reduce it to 50% which they might agree the workload is insane.  Probably going to say if a company offered me 50% more but had to work on weekends I would never choose it plus I didn’t get a hike last year.\n\nHowever the nagging is something unbearable that I felt the last time too. I was the critical employee for the manager there but here I am the so called critical employee for the whole project because honestly they are really bad at recruiting.So the nagging will be there. \n\nWould I sound stupid if I just say this is how the IT culture works and I am just doing it because it works this way. \nI am a super gullible person who can’t say no half the time so I want to make it sound like this isn’t our problem but the company problem.\n\n",

Finally with my own salary I bought a device One Plus 9 which was giving 87 fps in bootcamp in ultra hdr. Still I was stuck at 3 Kd my friends still at 7 and 5 Kd that’s when I realised my skills were trash. However I spent so much time in training grounds everything still I couldn’t do shit. Only thing that improved was 1 v1 I could beat most players.\n\nFast forward to last year I bought a one plus 12 and that trash phone couldn’t give even 70 fps in hot drop and first season the one before the skyhigh spectacle I was at 3.5 KD even though I started from gold. Next season after my hands fit I finally achieved 5.2 KD it was around 6+ till Ace. It was the only season my KD was more than my friends but he was still playing on Iphone 8.\n\n Still I was not satisfied even a 60 fps device was easily having 6 KD. So I bought the latest Ipad with 120 fps support from Ice Age event. I played the mecha event in 90 fps and could only maintain 3 KD because I was shifting devices next update onwards it was above 5.5 and currently at 5.2.\nI am so frustrated because I spent so much money thinking my device will pay for my skills but it can only to a certain extent. In fact I am sure I can maintain 5 KD on my phone too on 90 fps. With the Ipad I thought I can finally reach 7-8 KD and flex but no. I doubt I ever will reach 7 KD also.\n\nTLDR money can’t buy skills. \n\nMany of you will give tips play solo v squad and this and that but I have tried everything and I feel so frustrated. Just putting it out for you don’t expect your skill to drastically improve in 120 fps it will improve by 20-30% at start and max to max 40-50% in terms of KD. You will have to do next level training to actually improve.",

I don’t want any user except Manger users from editing it. Two ways to go about it first and simpler way is to just remove the access to that field for all permissionSets have a special permission Set for managers and give the edit access. Other way which requires using dynamic forms is go to the field and make it read only for all and visible to all except user with a role of Manager and then make it editable for that role.\n\nNow if I have two more places to set the field if annualRevenue &gt; $50 million or any opportunity related has amount &gt; $25 million which I put in the before trigger. Nobody cares about the field permission now.\n\nHowever if I have another place to set it from the opportunity if Amount &gt;$25 million on the opportunity after trigger now I have to care about the permission because when I write update as user account the running user won’t have the permission to update the isPriority field. Why does the first operation not require field level security but the second does ?( Talking about best practices)\n\nSecondly even when using LWC controllers often the only way to interact with that record is through that LWC. Let’s say I have a procedure to delete cases that are duplicates but I want the user to fill out information on the caseDuplicate record which will archive key information of that duplicate case before deleting the case. The org has a strict policy for sharing sensitive accounts which are marked as private but the caseDuplicate needs to pull information of that account. If I use with sharing I won’t be able to pull off information since those accounts are private. \n\nFurther I will now have to give delete access to cases to this user who can’t actually delete the cases except through here. If I want to follow the best practices.\n\nBasically my argument is why give unnecessary access to users. If someone shouldn’t be allowed to delete cases from the LWC but you fear they could use this LWC to do so and so you want to write the access keywords it feels completely counter intuitive. Instead the LWC should also be heavily guarded. The errors wouldn’t even look pretty with standard handling for the no delete access like it would probably give a huge stack trace with the error underneath. Instead if you first properly define who can use this component and then show an error message that you are not authorised on this page or even hide the way to this app/tab.\n\nThe biggest security flaw which is even worse is inspector. What if the user just uses inspector to update the isPriority field that they didn’t even had the access to do so in the first place.\n\nSo now you have got to block inspector from the org. But what if you are an ISV well now it’s upto the org using your product. You can technically have someone change the ISV__billing_amount__c on the opportunity because that org doesn’t block inspector. Everyone has the edit access on that field through the ISV important permissionset. All because there was one core opportunity creation lwc which autofills the billing amount in the controller.\n\nThe only way I see this working in 1% of the orgs is where each field is documented the user access to records and the sharing model thought of extensively. Inspector is blocked ( i.e making api requests to Salesforce ). That is when this last resort can work because there should be way more guardrails. \n\nI think I have made a fair bit of assumptions and that’s why I’m here to know what are the flaws in my arguments.\n\nEdit copied over from r/salesforcedevelopers as I can’t crosspost .",

All because there was one core opportunity creation lwc which autofills the billing amount in the controller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I have made a fair bit of assumptions and that’s why I’m here to know what are the flaws in my arguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way I see this working in 1% of the orgs is where each field is documented the user access to records and the sharing model thought of extensively. Inspector is blocked ( i.e making api requests to Salesforce ). That is when this last resort can work because there should be way more guardrails. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My Hip fire was great but not extremely good. My peek and ads was trash. Even then I had a very on/off performance against tdm players sometimes I would win 20-10 and sometimes loose 10-20 against the same players.\n\nFast forward to 2024 and now I am play on an Ipad pro M4 and again I haven’t been regular at the game. However I think I finally cracked what goes wrong with most tdm players. I experienced this just a few days ago from last week. I stopped playing BGMI until the 120 fps option came out but now that it came out I thought let me crush the tdm players. I get them from all chat however they aren’t noobs minimum 5-6 KD at least in the previous season when they were ACE.\n\nSo when I started play against them last week I lost most tdms or won just a few with a very small margin. I lost confidence in myself although I knew the nature of tdm is like this. I still felt like I was going to lose every single 1 v 1 fight in a match. I felt so pissed loosing badly like 10-16 12-20 etc against these players. I even lost 9-30 against one pro. They all were also on 120 fps mostly though. Anyway then I watched some youtube videos and found one channel Called Zoldyeck Playz. \n\nHis playstyle is the best if you don’t want to go full tournament mode but play like a beast. It’s an open secret that if you play against any good tdm players they will take tpp and fight always hold. You won’t find people taking fights in open. I imitated his style and one more thing I did was that I went to the training ground on the 20 meter target 300 health speed lvl 3 helmet only headshots I only focused on keeping my crosshair on the target and practiced.\n\nNow I haven’t lost a single game in more than 15 games and most 6 KD players are loosing even in single digit with me being on 30 if not with a 10-15 point lead at least.\n\nSo I am writing this post to partly remind myself in the future if I keep loosing that I can win and as a motivation to others that you can easily play 2-3 X better than you think you can.\n\nYou need to \n\n1 The absolute most important thing have confidence in winning the 1 v 1 fight screw the match.\n\n2 Practice a lot understand when to jump peek jiggle and most importantly hold. \n\n3 Get most points in enemies base as you are on attack he is on defence. \n\n4 Take cover shoot come back take cover shoot come back. Why this is important and the best players always do this is because there is an inherent flaw in BGMI’s net code. If you don’t take cover and even some bullets of the enemy gets registered and you come back the server can do wrong calculations and declare you dead even if your bullets were hitting.\n\n5 once you are low always wait for enemy to push.",

I imitated his style and one more thing I did was that I went to the training ground on the 20 meter target 300 health speed lvl 3 helmet only headshots I only focused on keeping my crosshair on the target and practiced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I haven’t lost a single game in more than 15 games and most 6 KD players are loosing even in single digit with me being on 30 if not with a 10-15 point lead at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I am writing this post to partly remind myself in the future if I keep loosing that I can win and as a motivation to others that you can easily play 2-3 X better than you think you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 The absolute most important thing have confidence in winning the 1 v 1 fight screw the match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 Practice a lot understand when to jump peek jiggle and most importantly hold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 Get most points in enemies base as you are on attack he is on defence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 Take cover shoot come back take cover shoot come back. Why this is important and the best players always do this is because there is an inherent flaw in BGMI’s net code. If you don’t take cover and even some bullets of the enemy gets registered and you come back the server can do wrong calculations and declare you dead even if your bullets were hitting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 once you are low always wait for enemy to push.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It keeps the game alive in fact I feel like at least 50 players should be there in the zone where the recall ends. In other games you will usually find the end circles more fun.\n\nOr they should disable recall when there are x no of players in the y zone until then everyone can get recalled through shop or something.\nSo you keep having fights and then the last zones become survival zones.\n\nEdit seems like all the pro players just got triggered you already have the ultimate royale mode.\n\nYou do realise that if there are no recalls the number of campers increase. My main concern is the lack of players in the end zone I personally want all those stupid bots removed and only pro players with a full 100 player lobby.

The match rarely had any bots at least no super bots. I played 2 matches and by that time it was +9 UTC spent a few minutes talking. \n\nThen I started the match again and I even got matched with Ace Players. However the entire lobby was filled with bots and a few decent players. Probably like 3 decent squads. Then the next match was even worse our squad was the only squad rest were all bots and one more squad which I 1v4 ed easily.\n\nSo my major point is this huge difference in matchmaking is really bad one can just sit and play bot lobbies at odd times and keep a highly inflated KD by just playing after some time\n\nIn the lobby they should add an option to fight 1v1 with other players until the match starts and a minimum of 3 mins of delay to get a quality match.",

I lost in the rematch even then he was not wearing any headphones.\n\nI asked him if he did the 20 meter training drill in the training grounds and he told me he had an accuracy of 30%. I couldn’t believe it.\n\nHe then shared a video of him doing the training drills and he did have like 26% accuracy. I watched a lot but couldn’t see much. I was at 10-12% accuracy.\n\nThere was a difference though he didn’t tell what attachments he used and my belief is that we should practice without attachments for any situation. \nI believe he was using attachments because even though in the video you can’t see laser sight he never used one he used thumb grip and stuff.\n\nI analysed more and saw he was using lvl 2 vest and I used lvl 3 vest but still thought it didn’t make a difference turns out it does. When I practiced without attachments same everything else I also got 20% accuracy. But on lvl 3 vest above 15% was hard I averaged 12-13%. With attachments 15%.\n\nBut today I found a new secret play tdm and training with high tempo songs and now you can see for yourself I got 19% on 10 targets in 52 seconds with an m416 no attachments full hip fire with full jiggle and 300 movement speed. \n\nI thought it was impossible it isn’t.",

I lost in the rematch even then he was not wearing any headphones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him if he did the 20 meter training drill in the training grounds and he told me he had an accuracy of 30%. I couldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He then shared a video of him doing the training drills and he did have like 26% accuracy. I watched a lot but couldn’t see much. I was at 10-12% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a difference though he didn’t tell what attachments he used and my belief is that we should practice without attachments for any situation. \nI believe he was using attachments because even though in the video you can’t see laser sight he never used one he used thumb grip and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I analysed more and saw he was using lvl 2 vest and I used lvl 3 vest but still thought it didn’t make a difference turns out it does. When I practiced without attachments same everything else I also got 20% accuracy. But on lvl 3 vest above 15% was hard I averaged 12-13%. With attachments 15%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But today I found a new secret play tdm and training with high tempo songs and now you can see for yourself I got 19% on 10 targets in 52 seconds with an m416 no attachments full hip fire with full jiggle and 300 movement speed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought it was impossible it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The other developers though senior don't know the basics of programming. So they can't solve complex problems.  \n\n\nEveryone knows that once you look at someone's code you think ahh that's how you do it. However no one knows the struggle behind that code until you try the problem for yourself. Till know (let me count) I have delivered at least 5 major tasks which weren't mine to begin with. However the senior devs take me in to help them. The manager thinks that I am helping them but I am actually doing their work for them because they can't. They try weird things which won't work ( I have a lot of experience with personal projects and previous company).   \n\n\nThe problem is that let's say that there is a body of work which takes 15 hours I can do it in 3-4 hours. So I have tried to artificially increase the time but then the senior dev comes and ruins everything with his gyaan. Worst part is that they ask me to share my screen the whole day I share my screen for at least 3-4 hours everyday. So I can't even fake it. I have tried to once pretend to not know what to do so the senior started giving his directions and to this day that code is messing my life because of how bad it is. I can't even argue cause he is like at 12-13 YOE guy.   \n\n\nSo basically everything is working against me long working hours. Loads of work. Managers putting more tasks because they don't understand that it is time consuming. If someone actually came into my project and looked at all this they would understand that this is pretty hopeless. I guess its like that in other projects too.  \n\n\nIn my previous project at least the manager and the team appreciated me a lot for all the hard work I did.

After that in college in the 3 rd year I finally got a gaming laptop. I played GTA V the Witcher 3 Just Cause 3 ,AC Origins etc. However this time I didn't feel that excited in fact I just played them in the lockdown because I didn't have anything better to do.\n\nI do still enjoy FPS shooters like Valorant and Apex Legends. Play them on and off.\n\nI finally have enough money to buy a RTX 4090 full spec PC and still have enough left over  for a lot but I decided to settle down to 1.3 Lakhs for a decent 4070 build. I already have a 1440p 144hz monitor.\n\nMy problem is that I have recently switched jobs and now I can't be sure how much free time I get. Plus I live in a PG and there is a space problem too. I am also concerned about moving out next year. All of this plus my old realisation that I actually do not enjoy gaming as much as I did when I was younger is making me second guess. I already have an old gaming laptop which still gives 144 fps at 1440p in Valorant the main game I play.\n\nHow do you guys manage the space and time crunch for gaming. I believe it is more productive to spend time in the GYM or something else. Gaming is necessary but only 1-1.5 hours a day and maybe 3-4 on weekends. I doubt I can even give that much time.\n\nSo now I am confused my childhood dream stands crushed by my own maturity. Don't know what to do.\n\nEdit\n\nMost of you are right that if I need to think so much I don't need one but I don't want to buy a laptop instead cause I need more fps and Graphics for the same price.\n\nThe Space issue is something I might face potentially not currently. I plan to live in PG's until I get married. So it might be something if I have to shift to congested places like  Bangalore it might give me issues.

Especially Sova Recon Darts. Sova will throw his recon dart immediately and most of the time won't gain anything other than which site the enemy is playing at or defender location which will change later. I find sova who darts in the middle of the round when your duelist is almost about to start a fight to be really beneficial. Other mistakes include Smoking on the site you are going to plant especially if someone else is faking another site. Better to hold for 10-15 seconds and then smoke.\n\nNot listening to comms and holding for a few more seconds. I have seen this happen so many times where one guy is backstabbing but the team never ever wants to take advantage of that. Instead they will push immediately and die. Had the backstab and the push started at the same time the outcome would be entirely different but no one has the patience to wait for a backstab.\n\nAnother common mistake I have seen so often so often that I can't even stress enough is not entrying with your duelist it goes both ways though. I have often seen the Duelist solo entrying and dying and no one trades them.  The other roles think that duelist will clear the whole site for them and then they will enter.

So if one doesn't open the door doesn't open. So yes you should rank up if you play properly and also only if all 5 are playing properly. \n\nI think 40% more importance should be given to solo play.\n\nLike can anyone explain how I got -16 on Bronze 2 account when I got two aces. One guy is iron 1 on my team other is AFK. \n\nWhat the f*** am I supposed to do ? Play Better get 500 avg combat score and I bet if I had even that much and lost somehow I would still get -16 cause the developers know the issue but the managers don't care at all.\n\nThe game is never ending its like I have to literally go practice DM whole day somehow get Diamond aim and movement comeback and play ranked to get out of bronze 3 which my MMR IS ALREADY OUT OF.\n\nThe ranked system needs a complete hard reset. And it just shouldn't be possible that 400 comabt score even get negative score.\n\nThe whole logic of team game and getting minus if you lose is the stupidest excuse peddlled by guys who think they are extra smart cause they spent 10 years into fps games.\n\nStraight up give + points even if you lose. But no we just want you to never climb to the next rank so easily. We want you to spend days and night to somehow get a good win streak by random probability not your skill. Thats the truth this game has to offer unless you are smurfing. \n\nI have seen radiants loosing going OT in bronze lobby not rank like the lobby level was bronze and they went OT. Then how can you give a minus games are independent of each other and not admit you messed up the matchmaking. They just peddle this nonsense that eventually you will climb .

Which is good. \n\nThen the topic moves out a little bit more maybe to gulf countries and Idk how this fact is so popular that Kuwait has the highest conversion rate in the world. Here is were they make the suggestion of moving to Kuwait instead of US because it has a higher valued currency. Which is just plain wrong. It doesn't matter if Kuwait had a conversion rate of 1 KD to 1000 rupees instead of 267 rupees you would just get paid 3 times less.  \n\nWhat people are basically suggesting is that if you make 50 k Inr you will make 50 k KD. \n\nAnother fun fact about these countries with higher valued currency is that because they have such a high value they are divided by 1000 like 1 KD = 1000 fils this was done before when they actually might have needed it these days I doubt you would find something below 50 fils.",

I have a strong belief that just wearing left and right might give the separation but not the complete experience. Also I am aware of audio reverse on PC but I have this issue on my phone.  \n\n\nAlso I need some opinion here. I used to use the cheap Realme earphones for gaming on my laptop but the right side isn't working like always.   \n\n\nI use Tws Bluetooth on phone but when I tried using them on pc the audio was so off that I couldn't even tell what it was.   \nI also play a lot of BGMI but I have issues with my Bluetooth buds as well in that they don't give a lot of  audio separation. I am planning to buy headphones now for both of them cause I game and they would be helpful. I am looking for suggestions but I do have one in my mind boat immortal 1000d they seem perfect for my use case.  \nNow the only issue is that on my phone the audio comes out reversed via a usbc to 3.5mm jack or else I wouldn't have even bothered this much. The boat immortal 1000d offers usb connection and people are claiming that an otg cable would work. I also thinkg that the otg cable might help in this case.",
