I joined because my previous company was being acquired by KKR(so it was going to be very bad for workers) and the new one was into new acquisition and needed rationalization on their IS.\n\nResult: I spend 1 week there, so far it is the worst project I've seen in my life I think. And it comes down to management for most part. It is engineered mediocrity, a pyramid of people there for their career ready to shit at each other at any point.\n\n* They cost in time and the sprint planing takes 2h with a head pm tossing tickets to anxious integrators who have the worst technical skills I've ever seen in my career(some have 10 years of experience on that project)\n* The specs are not even good at first place\n* Jira tickets are split into tasks that make no functionnal nor technical sense\n* Their do \"CI/CD\" with Jenkins and deprecated 15 years old middleware that a guy who left for making video games did years ago\n* They work at 10 on the same environment\n\nWhat would you do in that situation? Are you guys aware that crazy shit like that still exist even in companies that are thriving financiary? The job market is crazy tbh, they should hire plumbers btw.\n\nMore importantly. Is there any hope to rectify all that crap for them? What is the correct behavior to have when you feel surrounded by people set in debiliting lies and toxic company culture? Keep in mind that those people are delivering twice per sprint, they do deliver, just like shit linked in warrior style.\n\nEdit: Ty for the answer. I've got some great feedbacks from lots of them. I'm not inert, I was already writting code, reading documentation or documenting new ways of delivering during my first week. I'll give it 1 or 2 more weeks, but I'll definitely leave after a full sprint if I keep this impression, no money is worth that crappy feeling, I'm single so I won't ruin my life to sustain no life if I may say. People who spent 10 years there writting crappy specs or untestable code are retarded and won't get their years of skill progression back, I won't do the same mistake as them, there is no way, either they'll start working normally or it won't be with me.",

It's very bad imho because you reward players by lowering their experience, even slightly is bad because it sends negative unconscious signals\n* **Messed up ergonomy**: potions will still be far away from the inventory. Which is good for portable device users(two thumbs paradox) but is worse for pc players, furthermore it is arbitrarily too far\n\nI know that is lot of angelism in the remaining game community, however I'd argue that the current implementation is something Fen should be considerate about. It is a game that is meant to drag players, you can't arbitrarily set up half assed ux features and hope for the best.\n\nI'm not certain that I will be encline to use the belt long term as it, the clic distance and screen clutter are more drawbacks that benefits to me.\n\nNow suggestions:\n\n1. Give **quick action slots** like we have for spells but for anything we like for instance detect.\n2. Consider binds for repetitive actions like \"drink x potion\" or \"cast x non targetable spell\". Ideally allow **key binding of quick actions** for PC players.\n3. Generally, consider user experience when creating new features",

So for p2p players, it would be 56 to 556 and for players who trained combat up to lvl1000 in F2P, from 1020 to 1520.

Monkey madness quest for example looks like a nes point and clic game.

Put yourself in the choose of a brand new player installing rs, they don't care about qp they want to have fun, more complex combat or skilling are backloaded behind high lvl slayer, bossing and post priff skilling with  a budget that requires for you way to play the economy against players who know better and with content creators who never really speak properly to newer players rly, **you've lost 95%+ prospects at this point**.

The \"build\" shines are rushing content solo or duo with a support, saving tons of farming time in this very grindy game, also due to it's actual optimisation it is also great playing a support in dungeon or raid in current patch. I leveled like that and never had the idea to premium or something, everything went smoothly. This pathing shines the most at 25K prestiges where you get all your core symbols and evaporate any boss in few seconds alone, then starts getting sucked back in by the natural scalling of the game, but not enough to keep stomping content in semi organised duos or trios and keeping its edge in dungeons and stuffs. Show obviously extremly good results in raids and more aoe based pantheon things laters. \n\nGear choice:\n\n - Strengh/luck rings, focus on getting blue/greens with accuracy and crit on those. Don't choose them for the prestige they give. If you get perfect blue ones, they will remain better for a long time.\n - Blue main/offhand, you want to read the affixe, always take the one that suits best your playstyle, never pick one because of its prestige beeing higher.\n\nScalling mechanism: \n\n Game dificulty scales with your prestige. In a nutshell raw might and stamina are prestige inneficient, prestige gained on those will make game harder. Prestige gained in living stats(here strengh, luck, crit and accuracy) will have increased returns and make the game slightly easier, symbols give huge power bumps but give almost no prestige, same with chapels. Temple ranks gives effective hps so makes you tankier relative to your actual prestige level. If you have issues in the game, it is mainly because you are not optimised then. Proefficiency isn't something that is meant to be rushed, you up it naturally getting to a class to another and from a symbol to another. That said, never brush your atlas, take always the straightline between symbols/class, skip everything you can, even unlocking class skills/talents. About vectors, the only one that is efficient is the destruction vector, it is very prestige efficient but very poor on credit efficiency.\n\nFarming mechanics:\n\n The only thing that you can really toy with is your credit cap. The only things to remember are 1) holy text have a ratio of almost 2(when you get only holy texts through your credit cap you can sell those for almost twice of its original value), 2) looting everything is a credit loss in the long run then, 3) you can use real money getting credits. So do not bother with it if you have few bucks to spend(atm a 20$ pack is more than enough for everything you need and beyond).\n\nSymbols to focus before 35K prestige asap: \n\n - Ultimate strengh x2 (core) Because 1 point gives 10% accuracy too so it dramatically helps smoothing up your dps on bosses, you would kill them easily following this build at low prestige. \n - Max recoil x2 (core) \n - Element of surprise x 3 (core) Note that element of surprise is probably the best thing in Squad missions but remains useless in later contents such as anomalies/distorsions. Still a BiS.\n - Lacerated wound (core) \n - Rapid attack, impulse barrier, glorious triumph, clever manoeuver, might of the otherworlds(adequate) \n - summon occulat, lucky shot(low) \n\nSymbols to focus through anomalies in order of importance(36K+ prestige):\n\n - Compressive trauma + Ultimate strengh(first one) \n - Ultimate strengh + Max recoil (second one) \n - Mark of death x2 or Max recoil x 2 (third one, take max recoil if you want a more defensive build adding another tanking symbol first) \n - Mark of death x1(last) or Mark of death x2 (fourth) \n- Warrior's creed x2\n\nClass symbols: \n\n - Paladin (BiS for squishies, solo or in group) // Absolute Top tier \n\n- Witch/Warlock (best with compressive trauma + lacerated wounds hence it boosts uptime of both generating even more dps than the \"recount\" may show) // Top tier \n- Kinetic (reliable help on your burst) // Top tier \n- Alchemist (great buff with high uptime) // Top tier \n- Archer (moved from B to Top tier due to consensus, still below others Top tiers for me, class is fine) // Top tier\n\n- Gunner (According to feedbacks, seems to be a solid damage layer on single target extended fights; nothing more and nothing less) // A tier  \n- Berserker(unreliable uptime in current content) // A tier but Top for Zerk obviously\n\n- Necro (fastest class to lvl up so fastest way getting symbol slots, the passive tanks some skills from mobs and does roughly 3% of your dmg output) // B tier \n- Slayer (The uptime may vary in groups and the class is very long to fully unlock) // B Tier \n\n- Lightbringer (extremly solid ehp buff that is currently Bugged, still solid defensive layer from my numbers) // C Tier \n\n- Knight(nothing you would consider for actual PVE content) // Z tier \n- Cryomancer(highly unlikely to help you even once per mission) // Z tier \n- Monk(extremly good for some classes in PVP, or for monk himself on trashes, mostly useless) // Z tier\n\nChapels choices:\n\n - 2x crit chance\n - 2x accuracy (focus on uping those purple second)\n - 2x crushing blow (focus on uping those purole first)\n - 1x solidity\n - 1x what you feel better with, discharge recovery is nice in general tho if having impulse barrier or things like that.",

You can play and enjoy the game without botting, just you are more limited than it should if you don't. Because some underlining balance is made around bot users.(I don't because I find it gross and poor for the environnement, making a pc work for gathering pure virtual things is consumming electricity, porn doesn't count tho, ordering pizzas kind of is because it makes you fart hard in the end.)\n\n+ How can you play with cheating people, socialising with them, how can you take seriously someone buying exs online to some kind of bot? \n\nFor me the answer was: stop playing the game. \"FUCK THIS SHIT\" kind of reaction.\n\nI'm not telling the game is bad, I won't bother with reddit posts if I hadn't been in love withit.",

Because some underlining balance is made around bot users.(I don&amp;#39;t because I find it gross and poor for the environnement, making a pc work for gathering pure virtual things is consumming electricity, porn doesn&amp;#39;t count tho, ordering pizzas kind of is because it makes you fart hard in the end.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How can you play with cheating people, socialising with them, how can you take seriously someone buying exs online to some kind of bot? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me the answer was: stop playing the game. &amp;quot;FUCK THIS SHIT&amp;quot; kind of reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not telling the game is bad, I won&amp;#39;t bother with reddit posts if I hadn&amp;#39;t been in love withit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "parsedCommunityName": "ESObuilds",
    "body": "&gt;Hi, I'm gagagul(galuf was taken), galuf2 on Eu server. I'm a vr10 NB. I want to share my build. It is designed to farm relatively fast curent VR10 pub djs safely with a NB(bugged class with some imho poorly scaled skills) while doing great in PVP. You should reliably go beyond 400 dps in dungeons easily with a blue vr10 gear (wich is not glorious) and rape some vampire butts in pvp. It is possible to go far beyond that easily while exploiting shield bash with proper gearing. I also want to apologize about my approximative english.\n\n\n**Gear:**\n\n* Armor type: medium\n* Jewelry enchants : Weapon damage OR Mix of Bash damage / Reduce Bash cost (to be tested, less versatile at least)\n* Stamina: Caped\n* Health: Caped with food or just caped(better for lazy players or hardcore soloers, erk)\n* Magika: Rest in here, note that with proper gear affixes(infused) and legendary gear you can still get pretty high here. But who cares when VR12 is coming anyway.\n* Weapon enchants: stamina leech, but I don't know if it's remotely optimal.\n\n\n**General idea of skillbuild:**\n\nhttp://esobuild.com/?MwbgTCAMEHTAjDOFgCMBcB2GBDSAOGVOSSdAVhjHzBnjA1vizmEhkIBYzg4OR6AU3g5OAExjkAbOVTBOOKlICc8KZwBmkqZnid8OIAAA\n(it is subject to constant tweakings according to what you are doing and how obviously)\n\n\n**Reasonning:**\n\nSee Magika skills(class skills mainly) as a way to get edge in fights and to enhance your dps. Those skills are never spammed, except shadowy disguise sometimes when you know what you are doing to wreck some serious **** in PvP mainly. See stamina as potential damages and omgwtf ressources(anti stun, roll, etc). So you want to be perfectly stable in magika and never stamina starved while using some. It's easy to achieve by managing yourself and abusing stamina generation mechanics.\n\nCore skills are camouflaged hunter(except pve area without uds and daedras) / Flawless dawnbreaker / Poison arrow(any morph) / Vanish(any morph) and a shadow skill sloted in the second bar / at least a mobility skill.\n\nFlawless dawnbreaker is no brainer to me because in the actual \"metagame\" there are lot of vamps in PVP and anyway it is the only ultimate that scales with stamina + it improves passively all our damages sources + it is cheap. Veil of blade having maybe more utility in soloing hard content still.\n\nAs bar skills I wanted overall utility, not spaming my skills to do damage but to enhance myself at a point where I'm not starved fast but deal decent dps. One hand and shield is great for that because of the shield bash and my bow allows me safe ranged insta kills. Note that the builds lacks of AoE dps BUT atm stamina based AoE are too clunky and/or risky in high vr zones. If you want to AoE at any cost, better get a destruction staff then :D.\n\nCamouflaged hunter is a great tool in PvP and PvE, it deals far more damages than the silver shards and consumes less stamina. The burst and overall dps provided is that high that you'll find yourself not needing to stun the elites anymore most of the time.\n\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\n* In PvP before engaging always cast Camouflaged hunter(lots of vampire, lots of potential damage) and use it always in solo when facing uds and daedra.\n* Always charge attack with bow and use poison arrow as a filler between white hits. (engage in their backs) There is a little timing  to get.\n* While in melee your main damage source is your shield bash. In PvP often it is ok to not block a hit in duels in order to keep stamina that you'll convert certainly into something fast and painless(for you). Shield bash is that broken atm that it will outshine any stamina based single target dps while beeing decently cheap, providing armor AND free skills slots.\n* Identify healers or key targets(casters/bowmen) that are still up after engage and eventually swap and ambush into spam shieldbash on them.\n* Refine your gameplay by using different skills in different situations, don't be afraid of errors.\n* Self criticism. Don't let yourself die over and over if you start dying at a point in the game and make the necessary changes in gear and/or spec. It is always possible to cheese the game atm.\n\n\n**Honorable mention actives:**\n\n* Siphoning attacks: great skill that has many uses, including perma fear mobs or perma volcanic runes easily, trivialising most world bosses. Can also be used to loop a perma shield bash situation, doing consequent sustained damages in PVE. But there is dps loss and a skill slot used while you can just manage yourself. (still pretty decent on the second weapon with proactives toggles)\n* Haste: Even if it is buggy atm on ranged attacks, it is a big steroid skill that can help stabilize stamina. Particulary deadly with procs using light attacks in melee. This is a core skill of the Nightblade for PvE in general.(even if it's bugged atm)\n* Magnum shot(bow): trivialises a lot of things, use it if you feel like you need it.\n* Volcanic Rune(mage guild): You should try it if you have not.\n* Mage Light(mage guild): pretty strong against furtive assholes, put in you bar if your group is harassed in small scale pvp.\n* Power extraction: while potentially violent in PVE, the mobs imho scale too much for it to be reliable in solo AoE farm in high VRs(because risky and then not enjoyable at all) but it can be a more than amazing skill to have in PvE depending on the encounter. Basically a boss fight with lots of Adds. Use it with dawnbreaker to help on the adds while gaining dps on the boss. You win. Amazing.\n* Purge(PvP skill): sometimes in group plays but too stamina intensive imho in solo.\n\n\n**General Ideas about NB skills and how you should use those:**\n\n* *Siphoning skills*: these all have some unique and great purpose. Dots are great at generating ultimate points. BUT you are in medium armor and not focusing on your magika pool so their dps will be supbar, castimes painfulls in pvp and dps wise, utility situationnal especially in PVP. Bosses usually do not care either.\n* *Shadow skills*: there is an incentive to use a shadow hability from time to time in order to regenerate stamina. If you don't abuse that there is something wrong.\n* *Assassination skills*: You'll get plenty of crit with medium armor so you shouldn't be THAT worried about sloting a maximum of those at any cost even if these give a bump in dps while just sloted. There are often better choices for farmspeed, survivability, general pvp, etc...\n\n\n**End note:**\n\nI'm curious about weapon choices, I think bow is no brainer because it's ranged and very potent in PvP while not being subject to wtf moments in dungeoning; tryed DW but the single target dps isn't stellar at all especially in djs and haven't tryed 2 handed because I feared too much a lack of effectiveness due to stamina issues in long runs. I may have poorly judged some things in the post so feel free to commentate on what is wrong.",
