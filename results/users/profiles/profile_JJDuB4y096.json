DJM and Terry go for a standard 2 firsts \"+\". Everyone else in that same tier or better goes for an arm and a leg. My question to y'all is \" how do we 'reset' the league value\" or will people just constantly ask for absurd picks for players forever. Is there a way to break the ice I guess is what I am asking to make these players just worth \"mid first\" where KTC values them at. Thanks!",

My league &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;  feel, overvalues players. DJM and Terry go for a standard 2 firsts &amp;quot;+&amp;quot;. Everyone else in that same tier or better goes for an arm and a leg.

I believe their upcoming earnings 6/8 will be monumental and they should be delivering a brinks truck to your driveway...\n\n**Recent Events**\n\nASO just recently paid down over 99Million Dollars in debt.

During their earnings report they announced a crushing of earnings, this is resulting from primarily their ecommerce, in store purchases opening up and yes you guessed it, GUNS. Their share price after earnings announcement jumped from roughly $84 to $98. I see ASO moving in a similar pattern, expecting to CRUSH earnings with ammo, guns, retail, and ecommerce trading.
