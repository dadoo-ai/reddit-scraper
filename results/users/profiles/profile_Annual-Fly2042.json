You need a lot of nerves as Salesforce support is very slow to respond.\n\nYou need env hub where you can create orgs from there. \n\nHere you can read more about it: [https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/environment\\_hub\\_manage\\_create\\_org.htm](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/environment_hub_manage_create_org.htm)\n\nAfter that, create an org that will be purely for that app and create the namespace+package there. Only when you are ready to send it for security review, make it a released app. Also, the price is $999 for the security review, but if you are listing for for, you need to open a support case where they will give you a voucher where you will lower the price for $1 dollar.",
