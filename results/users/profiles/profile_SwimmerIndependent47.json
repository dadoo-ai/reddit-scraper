I can’t wrap my head around how there are only 2 doors when you enter the room just off the theater, but there seem to be at least 4 exit doors- plus I feel like I’ve entered that left door multiple times and exited in completely different locations.  We’ve met Band Stand Mickey and Steamboat Willie Mickey through that left door. I know I’ve met sorcerer Mickey in the past, but I can’t remember which door we used. Best I can figure is the film canister shelves move and reveal different doors/hallways, but I still can’t picture the full layout. Anyone have any insight? Thanks!",
