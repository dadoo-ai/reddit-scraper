After that it took a whole month to get the valuation booked in, because sales agent was just unreachable and in the end it was arranged by me calling everyone and practically having a conference call. We were also trying to arrange a viewing during that time and 1 time couldn't get access to the plot we reserved because they misplaced keys. They had to replace locks after that, or so they said\n\nWe just had our viewing after month of of trying and were appaled by the state of the apartment, there was a small crack on the wall next to the entrance door, apartment reeked of stale water and all drains were rusted and scale in toilets. Which I think is a bit unaceptable for a new built. We also thought that it was a bit smaller than the showroom, but that might just be our minds playing tricks on us since floorplan is the same.\n\nSo we are just a bit undecided on what to do, who to complain to. This is our first time purchasing a home and we have been in temporary accommodation for the past month (we don't want to commit to a 6-12 month rent), so starting the process all over isn't really an option.\n\nAny advise is appreciated!",

The property has a chase that presumably hides piping and there was definitely water leakage there. The walls on 2nd floor had discoloration (not wet to touch), and ceiling on the ground floor next the chase were very mouldy. \n\nThe price is 20-30k less than similar properties around and they are asking the same price it was sold for in 2017 (250k). This is in London. \n\nMy gut tells me it's repairable, and it should fine but my partner is freaking out. \n\nOf course, Its not much to go by, but wanted to know if you have any experiences with dealing with such stuff and what would the advise be for a first time buyer.\n\nEdit: EA said there will be plumbers coming to take a look in a few days, but I'm not counting on that",

Which could be around 30k if we were to wait.\n\nI have already tried mortgage in principle and have been given an agreement for 280k.

Other than that, I don't have any loans or debts.\n\nShould we wait until I pay off the debt and save a bit more for the downpayment or start looking for mortgage brokers already?\n\nHow much should we save for legal fees and etc?\n\nIs there much difference between online brokers and local brokers?

This isn&amp;#39;t quite enough for flats/houses that we are looking at and we are considering shared ownership resale properties as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have around 8k debt in credit cards which I&amp;#39;m paying off slowly (0% balance transfer for 3 years, incurred to pay tuition fees for specialized courses). Other than that, I don&amp;#39;t have any loans or debts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should we wait until I pay off the debt and save a bit more for the downpayment or start looking for mortgage brokers already?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much should we save for legal fees and etc?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there much difference between online brokers and local brokers? I&amp;#39;ve also had people reaching out to me to advise after my mortgage in principle application offering advise(not from the bank, some 3rd party brokers) - should I stay away from them?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The MongoDB schema has been one of those things that kept changing and delaying the release of the project. Mostly because it’s quite easy to remodel and it’s dynamic\n\nSo the project:\n\n1. I will communicate with an open API (wargaming API for world of tanks) and store player statistics for data aggregation and visualisation.\n2. The API doesn’t provide player session data (daily games played) which will be calculated and stored as well.\n3. There are millions of players in each of 4 clusters (EU, NA, RU, ASIA)\n\nInitially, I thought I will create 1 big document about a player and store everything there:\n\n1. Player details (\\~30 fields)\n2. Player’s tank details (array of max 700 objects that have 15 fields and one nested object)\n3. Player’s session stats (array of sessions on each update, e.g. it will have 1 object per day if updated daily)\n4. historical data (array of object with 5-6 fields of player to keep historical info)\n\nNow I already understand that player session needs its own collection, but I can’t decide between the 2 models I have in mind:\n\n1. Document \\_id will be same as player \\_id and it will have 1 field sessions that will contain an array of sessions.\n2. Document \\_id will be unique and new record for each update, so bunch of documents as sessions instead of an embedded array.\n\nI guess my main concern with 2nd approach is that there's a potential of millions of documents being created per day. Should that be a concern?\n\nThe question about player’s tank statistics - should I keep it on the player document or also move it to it’s own collection with player\\_id+tank\\_id? The reason I ask is that a lot of aggregation will be based on this, and I think nested array within player collection might not be the best thing to do?\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks for any help!\n\nI have [attached](https://www.file.io/download/j3FMrkJtFU54) a sample “unoptimized” document",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m currently working on my first full stack application and I’m building the backend with node.js + typegoose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a good understanding of concepts and limits but I’m really not confident in my abilities and end up questioning every step I do. The MongoDB schema has been one of those things that kept changing and delaying the release of the project. Mostly because it’s quite easy to remodel and it’s dynamic&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the project:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I will communicate with an open API (wargaming API for world of tanks) and store player statistics for data aggregation and visualisation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The API doesn’t provide player session data (daily games played) which will be calculated and stored as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are millions of players in each of 4 clusters (EU, NA, RU, ASIA)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought I will create 1 big document about a player and store everything there:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Player details (~30 fields)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Player’s tank details (array of max 700 objects that have 15 fields and one nested object)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Player’s session stats (array of sessions on each update, e.g. it will have 1 object per day if updated daily)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;historical data (array of object with 5-6 fields of player to keep historical info)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I already understand that player session needs its own collection, but I can’t decide between the 2 models I have in mind:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Document _id will be same as player _id and it will have 1 field sessions that will contain an array of sessions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Document _id will be unique and new record for each update, so bunch of documents as sessions instead of an embedded array.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my main concern with 2nd approach is that there&amp;#39;s a potential of millions of documents being created per day. Should that be a concern?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question about player’s tank statistics - should I keep it on the player document or also move it to it’s own collection with player_id+tank_id? The reason I ask is that a lot of aggregation will be based on this, and I think nested array within player collection might not be the best thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post and thanks for any help!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=\"https://www.file.io/download/j3FMrkJtFU54\"&gt;attached&lt;/a&gt; a sample “unoptimized” document&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The connection is via USB 3.1 GEN 1 type C port on the laptop to the USB C port on the monitor. It lights up, so there's power - but it says no signal.\n\nI tried following steps on [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DisplayLink](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DisplayLink), have done everyting until:\n\n`$ xrandr --listproviders`\n\nWhere I only get 1 provider, so there's nothing to connect:\n\n`Provider 0: id: 0x43 cap: 0xf, Source Output, Sink Output, Source Offload, Sink Offload crtcs: 3 outputs: 2 associated providers: 0 name:modesetting`\n\nCan someone advise me on this?
