Assuming you are otherwise a healthy 18 yr old, you have nothing to worry about. A few things to help with the anxiety... \n\nStop reading about the virus. You're not going to find some magic solution to being down and out with COVID. The more you read, the more it will fuel your anxiety. Millions and millions of ppl have gotten Covid and are just fine. Don't \"what if\" think. If something is going to happen, there is little to worry about until it actually happens.\n\nTry some breathing exercises for the anxiety. Lay down or get comfortable in a chair. Close your eyes. Concentrate on your breathing. Breathe in through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. It helps to count. Your mind will try and bring you back to a state of panic. Don't let it! Don't stop until all you are focused on is your breathing. Keep doing this until you can go a minute or so without a panicky thought. You'll feel much better.\n\nYou're going to be fine. Nothing is wrong with you.",
