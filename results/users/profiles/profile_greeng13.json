    "body": "Hello, I'm hoping someone here can help me out as I am at my wit's end!\n\n**My computer info:**  \nDell Latitude 7390\n\nBIOS Version: Dell, Inc.  1.32.0   Date: 4/10/2023\n\nSMBIOS Version: 3.1\n\nBIOS Mode: UEFI\n\n  \n\n\n**OS INFO:**\n\nWindows 10 Pro\n\nVersion: 22H2 - 10.0.19045\n\nInstalled on 8/10/2023\n\nOS Build: 19045.6093\n\n  \nISSUE:  \nOvernight my computer did an update automatically which was expected: (KB5062554) - \"2025-07 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems\". This seemed to install 2 things:  \n1. Security Update for Microsoft Windows (KB5062554)  \n2. Servicing Stack 10.0.19041.6088\n\n  \nI woke up and my computer was at the Login screen - again, expected.\n\nI normally log in with a PIN and it said something like \"Something went wrong, PIN unavailable. Click to create PIN or restart\" or something like that. Clicking to create a PIN did not work. So, I restarted.\n\nDuring restart it popped up with a message:  \nAlert! TPM Device is not detected.\n\nPress F1 key to retry boot.  \nPress F2 key for setup utility.  \nPress F3 key to run onboard diagnostics.\n\n  \nSo, I pressed F1, and it booted to windows screen and again, the same message about PIN currently unavailable. Thankfully, I have a local password and I am able to login using that.\n\nWhen I try to reset the PIN in settings I eventually land on a page that says:\n\n\"Something went wrong the trusted platform module, which is used to secure your PIN on this device is not available right now\"\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\* NOTE: the previous Windows update severely slowed down my system! I actually rolled back that update and my system went back to normal. I did not do any other updates until Windows did this update last night.*\n\n*HOWEVER! - I also notice in the Update History that Windows DID reinstall that update (KB5001716) on 7/21/2025. I didn't even notice... but it is in the Update History*\n\n  \nMY QUESTION(S):  \n1. Did the Windows 10 update somehow break my TPM? I have never had an issue until this update. And, it is literally the very next reboot of my system after this update that seems to have broken it.\n\n2. Not only that, but even when I go into my BIOS settings, the TPM setting option just doesn't exist there...it's (poof) gone! How can I correct this?\n\n3. I know I need to upgrade to Windows 11. And, with all of this going on I downloaded the MS PC Health check app which says all the hardware requirements are there (including the TPM 2.0???). How is that even possible?\n\n  \nI'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. Dell's website is not much help at all...and, it brings up a different issue that even though I have completely uninstalled the SupportAssist App (and I thought all remnants of it) I am unable to reinstall the app - keeps saying that the \"Latest version is already installed\" - again, that's a different issue for now.\n\n  \nWhy did the TPM just seem to disappear? Am I the only one having this issue?\n\n  \nTIA!! Any help would be appreciated\n\n\n\n",

He told me that he would have to call me back tomorrow because the system was down for maintenance? Really, maintenance at 4:00pm on a weekday?\n\nSeriously...they have made my problem worse!\n\nMy issue was that I recevied a voicemail today and it did not appear as a text message like it ALWAYS has.\n\n  \nI was unsure if this was due to Samsung's crappy OneUI 7.0 forced update or something on T-Mobile's end.\n\nRep 1 seemed to understand but we were going in circles due to him not understanding the context of the English language...honestly, I thought I had been directed to Tech Support from the get-go...that didn't seem to be the case when he was telling me to long press the #1 button to \"set up\" my voicemail&gt;&gt;\n\n  \nRep 2 laughed at this and assured me that they could help... great! Well...after about 15 or so minutes with Rep 2, the phone disconnected. I was told that after a restart my problem would be solved. So, I took the opportunity to restart the phone. Problem was NOT resolved and now became WORSE...\n\n  \nThe good news is that Rep #2 had left a voicemail! Still no text of the voicemail which was the entire reason for my call!  \nThe BAD NEWS - now, when I click to listen to a voicemail, instead of just entering my pin, I now am forced to enter my entire 10-digit number and then my PIN??? WTF??\n\nRep 2 did call back again and I informed of this issue... I informed that the initial reason I called has now become worse....he kept repeating (as if in a loop) that he would be able to take care of me today...and that it would be resolved.\n\nWell, 5 minutes llater he said something like \"oops\" - i was like \"what?\"   \nRep 2: Well, I will need to call you back sometime tomorrow to take care of this because our system is down for maintenance? SERIOUSLY???\n\n  \nI asked to speak to a manager becaue I feel like i am gettting absolutely NOWHERE. After some time with no hold music or anything - the line seemed dead - Rep 2 came back and said that the manager would have to call me back later this evening or tomorrow morinin because the system was down for maintenace??\n\nI informed him that now, if anyone calls and leaves a voicemail, I would have to enter my 10-digit phone number and then my PIN to finally hear the message....let alone the fact that the initial reason for my call was never resolved - that voicemail's were no longer appearing as text messages.\n\n  \nSo, anyone here that represents T-Mobile - IS THE SYSTEM DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE?? I have tried calling my local store just to check (because i think im having proverbial smoke blown up my wazoo) and that just rings and rings and the call ends bc no on picks up...\n\nI try calling 611 several times only to be waiting for over 15 minutes and finally giving up...\n\n",

Represents the number of Physical Vinyl Records (mostly this will be only one but Box sets can have many)\n* **Number\\_of\\_Artists\\_Bands\\_\\_c:** A Number field - again, most Albums only have one Artist/Band but (collaboration/compilation albums have multiple)\n* **Album\\_MBID\\_\\_c:** Text (External ID) field for the specific Album's ID in the music database I am querying\n\n**Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c**\n\n* **Album\\_\\_c:** This is a Lookup to Album\\_\\_c custom object\n* **Song\\_\\_c:** This is a Lookup to Song\\_\\_c custom object\n* **Solo\\_Artist\\_\\_c:** Checkbox - denotes if artist is a \"Group\"/Band or Solo - still have this field but replaced it with the picklist below (Artist\\_Type\\_\\_c)\n* **Artist\\_Type\\_\\_c**: Picklist with 2 values, \"Group\" or \"Person\"\n* **Artist\\_MBID\\_\\_c:** Text (External ID) field for the specific Artist/Band's ID in the music database I am querying\n* **Band\\_Member\\_\\_c**: This is a Lookup to Musician\\_\\_c custom object\n\n**Musician\\_\\_c** - this is for the individual artist (individual/solo) and band members if it's a Group\n\n* **Album\\_\\_c:**  Lookup to Album\\_\\_c custom object\n* **Musician\\_s\\_MBID\\_c**:  Text (External ID) field for the specific Musician's ID in the music database I am querying\n\n**Song\\_\\_c**\n\n* **Album\\_\\_c:**  Lookup to Album\\_\\_c custom object\n* **Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c:**  Lookup to Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c custom object\n* **Song\\_Length\\_minutes\\_\\_c:**  Number field for the minutes of a song's length\n* **Song\\_Length\\_seconds\\_\\_c:**  Number field for the seconds of a song's length \n* **Song\\_Length\\_Total\\_seconds\\_\\_c:**  Formula (Number) that calculates the total seconds of a song's length when the user enters minutes and seconds. Example, on the Album's jacket a song is 3:22. User enters \"3\" in the \"minutes\" and \"22\" in the seconds. This field calculates to 202 seconds\n* **Song\\_Length\\_\\_c:**  Formula (returns Text) - this displays the length of the song in a mm:ss format\n* **MBID\\_Track\\_ID\\_\\_c:**  Text (External ID) - this represents the song's (track's) unique ID number from the API/Music Database I am using. Some Albums aren't in that database though so this field will not always be populated\n* **Vinyl\\_App\\_Song\\_Number\\_\\_c**:  Auto Number - because there can be MANY different versions of a Song on MANY different Albums and by MANY different Artists I felt this was necessary as well... This is the \"Track Number in Collection\" so it will always be unique.\n\nSo, all is going relatively well. However, I have some additional functionality I would like to incorprate and I am not sure the best approach.\n\n \n\n1. An instance of an \"Album\" has at least 1 Physical Record. But, can have multiple Physical Records - I need a way to best show both on the Album Record Detail and on the Song Record Detail pages what actual Physical Record of the Album this Song is on - **I have NOT created this Object yet.**\n\n \n\n2. A Physical Record has only 2 sides. However, when I am getting the JSON response back for Albums that are \"Box Sets\" or multiple discs, I noticed that the sides are denoted alphabetically. Example: Beastie Boys - Ill Communication is a 2 record Album. Record 1 has sides \"A\" and \"B\" while record 2 has sides \"C\" and \"D\"\n\n* I would like to find a way to denote what Physical Record a song is on and show that on the Album\\_\\_c and Song\\_\\_c detail pages\n* Also to show what Side of that Physical Record the song is on (both the Album\\_\\_c and Song\\_\\_c detail pages)\n* I'd like to figure out the best way to also give a Total Length of a Physical Record\n* And, a Total Length of each side.\n* Should I create 2 \"junction\" objects: 1. Record Number and 2. Side to handle this so that I can display this for both the Song\\_\\_c detail page and the Album\\_\\_c detail page??\n* Could I just create a Custom LWC to incorporate the information I would like to display on each record detail page? Like maybe a \"combobox\" or similar?\n\nBasically, in my mind, an \"Album\" owns the Physical Record(s) and the Physical Record(s) own the Sides of the Records, right? \n\n**I have not yet created an Object for Side**\n\n \n\nEven trying to type this out I am confusing myself :)\n\n \n\nTo further complicate things, I would also like to have a way to handle the Artists and the Band Members.\n\n \n\nSo, an Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c can be a Group or an Individual.\n\n1. Each Artist/Band (Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c) has at least one Musician\\_\\_c - but, this might end up where the Artist\\_s\\_MBID\\_\\_c (from the Musician\\_\\_c object) is identical to the Artist\\_MBID\\_\\_c (from the Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c object). I don't think this is necessarily an issue though\n\n2. Each Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c has at least one Album\\_\\_c\n\n3. Each Musician\\_c MUST have a Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c  - even if it is themself.\n\n4. A Musician\\_\\_c can be related to more than one Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c (Example: Warren Haynes has played with The Allman Brothers, Gov't Mule, Dickey Betts Band, Widespread Panic, Phil Lesh and Friends, the Dead...... the guy gets around!!)\n\n5. If an Album is a compilation of songs from Various Artists then the default Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c is \"Various Artists\" but I MUST be able to denote which Artsit\\_Band\\_\\_c performs on which song on an Album\\_\\_c\n\n \n\nIdeally, I would like to be able to go to a Musician\\_\\_c detail page and see\n\n* What Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c they have been part of\n* What Songs they have been part of\n* What Albums they have been part of, etc\n\nAnd, when I go to an Album\\_c detail page I can see:\n\n* What Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c are involved (usually just one but if its a compilation there could be many)\n* What Musician\\_\\_c are involved to drill down a bit more.\n* Example: for the Album\\_\\_c \"Lawn Boy\" by Phish, I would see Artist\\_Band\\_\\_c \"Phish\" and Musician\\_\\_c  --&gt; 1. Trey Anastasio, 2. Mike Gordon, 3. John Fishman, &amp; 4. Page McConnell\n\nThen for the Song\\_\\_c detail page I would like to see the same - some songs have guest musicians on them.... \"ft. so-an-so\" so on an Album by a single band there might be 10 songs and all of the songs each have one different Musician that is not on the others, if that makes sense.\n\n \n\nCan all of this be accomplished with just lookup relationships? Or should I consider a Junction Object?\n\n \n\nOr, could I just create a Custom LWC to incorporate the information I would like to display on each record detail page? Like maybe a \"combobox\" or similar? I have created some to handle my API response to display to the user when adding a new Album to the collection. Even got it to display Cover Art Images in a table like format with checkboxes, etc :)\n\nSorry for the long post! I hope I am clearly asking for what I need assitance with and I hope someone who has a much better grasp on this than I do can assist me. I really would appreciate it!!\n\n \n\nAnd, If more clarity is needed, please ask!\n\nI'm sure I could figure out a way to make this MUCH simpler...and I might actually have to. But, where would be thne fun in that :)\n\n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated! \n\nTIA",
