Currently have a little over 100k invested assets (no debt). My current strategy is to have a couple thousand in my checking account for bills, a couple thousand more in HYSA for emergency fund, and everything else straight into VOO or QQQM. So the amount of actual liquid cash I have at any point is pretty much always under $15,000. \n\n  \nI'm wondering, at what point do I start saving for down payment on a house? Obviously it depends on where and what kind of house I'm trying to buy, but is there a general guideline between fire-ers as to when I might want to stop dumping everything into the stock market and start saving some cash? Is it normal for people to perhaps sell some of their index funds around their 30s for a down payment? \n\n  \nThank you all in advance, I would be nowhere financially without this subreddit. ❤️",

I was told that for one of the rounds for the interview, I will be asked to \"prepare an Agentforce demo, showing your technical skills around the agent actions: flows and apex.\" I was also told that I could treat this kind of like a take-home assignment where I do it at home and then do it again in front of the interviewer.\n\nI have 0 prior experience using salesforce so I went to trailheads and followed the guide using Coral Cloud Resorts as an example. However, I feel like following that guide is not representative of what will actually be expected of me from the interview. Not only did I not write any Apex code (which the recruiter told me I would have to do during the interview, and I don't know where I'd even write it), but from my understanding of building something like this from scratch, I would have to create a website similar to the Coral Cloud Resorts on my own, and also set up data in the Data Cloud for me to consume.\n\nI just have no idea where to get started; I'm assuming that experience with the actual Salesforce platform is not required but I have no idea how to create my own Einstein AI playground or whatever. I don't even have a Salesforce account. I hit the recruiter back after realizing this asking to set up another 15 minute meeting tomorrow to ask clarifying questions, as this seems like a monumental task to do within a few days for someone with exactly 0 salesforce experience.
