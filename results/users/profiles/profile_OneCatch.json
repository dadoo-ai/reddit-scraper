Also a possible issue with another probate having not been completed about 10 years ago. **At this stage I'd be grateful for any general advice about how such situations can be handled.**  \n\nAn elderly relative of mine recently died. She was widowed about 10 years ago when her then-husband died. The husband had a couple of grown-up kids from a previous marriage (ex-wife also long-deceased). The husband, when he remarried, verbally reassured his kids that there was strong provision for them in the will, since the house and probably a chunk of his other assets predated the second marriage.  \n\nThe issue is that no will has been found for her. Some cursory research suggests that this means that the inheritance would default to the deceased's sister, nieces, and nephews.  \n\nAdditionally, there seems to have been no will for the husband, and probate seems to not have been completed after his death (and no-one has any idea what the implications of that are, except that it presumably rules out that the husband had held anything in trust for his kids?). \n\nEveryone is in agreement that - at the very least - the house should go to the husband's kids. Genuinely positive and constructive sentiment from all quarters so far, and we'd all like to keep it that way.  \n\nBut I want to ensure that potential liabilities are considered before anyone makes hasty commitments to 'sign over the house' or whatever - for example, I wouldn't want the nieces and nephews to blithely sign over their £100k share in a house, to then find themselves liable for a large Capital Gains tax bill or similar.  \n\nAnd if we can set early expectations about what's likely to be needed, in terms of legal advice, tax bills, and so on, then it should reduce the probability of an unfortunate falling out later.\n\nIf you got this far and are intending to reply - thanks!",

    "body": "This is an insane plan.  \n\n&gt;he and his wife want to do extensive renovations by us taking out a shared £180k mortgage. The ideal would be to split this 50/50 rather than diluting my share   \n\n*Why on earth* would you spend £90k - hundreds a month - on something which offers no benefit to you, and only a very uncertain long-term return (if the value increase was actually realised at all, it only benefits you when both of you agree to sell, or one of you forces a sale through litigation).  \n\n&gt;therefore all renovations decisions will be equally balanced.  \n\nRenovation decisions will not be balanced in practice - they'll be living there and you won't. Are you *really* going to tell them that they can't paint their bedroom the colour they've chosen? Because unless you are willing to be that stubborn, the decisionmaking is de facto theirs. Also, what happens when one of them drops a skillet and smashes that lovely new induction hob? Are they covering the cost or are you? And does that make it *their* hob or joint? Absolute minefield.  \n\n&gt;However, he thinks he should only pay me a little more than what we get in holiday rent, he suggested £400pm.  \n\nThe extra he's proposing *above what you already earn on average* wouldn't even cover your half of this new mortgage. That's an absolute pisstake, you'd be worse off than you are now, while paying for something that only benefits him. In fact, I'm, not certain that even the £1000 you're suggesting would be enough to cover your portion of the mortgage *and* the overpayments necessary to get it cleared in 10 years like he''s allegedly committing to. So you might be worse off even then.  \n\n&gt;Second, I’m worried that taking on the £90k mortgage will negatively impact my ability to get a mortgage in future.  \n\nIt will. You'd also lose access to various first time buyer schemes and discounts. Could even affect renting; it's a regular mandatory payment so it might affect affordability checks.\n\n&gt;He’s hoping we can pay off the total in 10 years but he only earns around £70k and his wife works part time at close to minimum wage, so I don’t see how that’s possible.  \n\nI wouldn't say *only* £70k - that's double the average UK salary! Nonetheless, your concerns are valid. Especially because he'll be paying you rent (at whatever rate) in addition to paying off his half of the mortgage. As soon as there's financial difficulty he'll be asking to cut the rent he pays you so he can keep paying the mortgage \"because getting the mortgage paid off ultimately benefits you sis\".  \n\n&gt;My brother says the renovations will increase the house’s value 1.5x so it’s a good investment for me. But if we don’t sell the house and he pays me little rent, I don’t much benefit.  \n\n*If* they increase the value that much. And *the benefit is only realised when the house is sold*. Also, yours and your brothers interests are potentially at odds in various ways. Firstly because you have an incentive to sell the home earlier than he might want to - imagine if they have kids and it becomes 'the family home' and you become the wicked witch of the west for forcing them to sell when their kids are 11 and 13. Secondly because if he bails, the inflated value would result in you having to buy him out for more. Thirdly because he'll have a lovely place to live regardless of how long the mortgage takes to pay, whereas you'll be much more constrained in what you can do with your life until the mortgage is paid off.\n\n&gt;if they realise they don’t like living there (as it’s not a great permanent area for a young working couple) they won’t be able to afford to move to a new home without us being forced to sell the place.  \n\nThey 100% won't be able to buy another home on that salary if the mortgage on this one is still outstanding. So, yes, you'd need to sell the whole property to pay off the mortgage early. If you or they couldn't keep up payments then you'd need to go interest only, the other party would have to cover their share, or the property would have to be sold.  \n\n----  \n\nI get that I'm being a bit caustic here, but this is an awful idea on so many levels. I get that your relationship with your brother is important to you, but he's either got target fixated and left reasonableness somewhere along the way when planning this, or he's quite deliberately taking advantage of you. **Being reductive, he is asking you to take on enormous financial liability, reduce your practical monthly income for a decade or more, and price yourself out of homebuying, in order to fund him living in a freshly renovated £850k property while you, presumably, spend the next 10 years living in something much cheaper.** And the *only* benefit to you is that you get 50% when it is eventually sold, which might be in 40 years.  \n\nA more reasonable starting point for discussion would be that they move in, pay you a reasonable rental income (start at market rate and then discount, don't work up from what it currently earns you passively), and they pay for whatever renovations they want themselves. Then their contribution is protected contractually (should be doable with a solicitor) - so if they put in 50k, then 50k of the proceeds of sale is ringfenced to pay them back, if they put in 100k then 100k is ringfenced, etc etc. Not a percentage of equity. If the value will be increased as much as they say, then it's a good investment for them too, even without a slice of additional equity!  \n\nOr he can buy you out. Or you can sell and both get a windfall. Or continue the status quo.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an insane plan.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;he and his wife want to do extensive renovations by us taking out a shared £180k mortgage. The ideal would be to split this 50/50 rather than diluting my share   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why on earth&lt;/em&gt; would you spend £90k - hundreds a month - on something which offers no benefit to you, and only a very uncertain long-term return (if the value increase was actually realised at all, it only benefits you when both of you agree to sell, or one of you forces a sale through litigation).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;therefore all renovations decisions will be equally balanced.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Renovation decisions will not be balanced in practice - they&amp;#39;ll be living there and you won&amp;#39;t. Are you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going to tell them that they can&amp;#39;t paint their bedroom the colour they&amp;#39;ve chosen? Because unless you are willing to be that stubborn, the decisionmaking is de facto theirs. Also, what happens when one of them drops a skillet and smashes that lovely new induction hob? Are they covering the cost or are you? And does that make it &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; hob or joint? Absolute minefield.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, he thinks he should only pay me a little more than what we get in holiday rent, he suggested £400pm.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The extra he&amp;#39;s proposing &lt;em&gt;above what you already earn on average&lt;/em&gt; wouldn&amp;#39;t even cover your half of this new mortgage. That&amp;#39;s an absolute pisstake, you&amp;#39;d be worse off than you are now, while paying for something that only benefits him. In fact, I&amp;#39;m, not certain that even the £1000 you&amp;#39;re suggesting would be enough to cover your portion of the mortgage &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the overpayments necessary to get it cleared in 10 years like he&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s allegedly committing to. So you might be worse off even then.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Second, I’m worried that taking on the £90k mortgage will negatively impact my ability to get a mortgage in future.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will. You&amp;#39;d also lose access to various first time buyer schemes and discounts. Could even affect renting; it&amp;#39;s a regular mandatory payment so it might affect affordability checks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He’s hoping we can pay off the total in 10 years but he only earns around £70k and his wife works part time at close to minimum wage, so I don’t see how that’s possible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t say &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; £70k - that&amp;#39;s double the average UK salary! Nonetheless, your concerns are valid. Especially because he&amp;#39;ll be paying you rent (at whatever rate) in addition to paying off his half of the mortgage. As soon as there&amp;#39;s financial difficulty he&amp;#39;ll be asking to cut the rent he pays you so he can keep paying the mortgage &amp;quot;because getting the mortgage paid off ultimately benefits you sis&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My brother says the renovations will increase the house’s value 1.5x so it’s a good investment for me. But if we don’t sell the house and he pays me little rent, I don’t much benefit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; they increase the value that much. And &lt;em&gt;the benefit is only realised when the house is sold&lt;/em&gt;. Also, yours and your brothers interests are potentially at odds in various ways. Firstly because you have an incentive to sell the home earlier than he might want to - imagine if they have kids and it becomes &amp;#39;the family home&amp;#39; and you become the wicked witch of the west for forcing them to sell when their kids are 11 and 13. Secondly because if he bails, the inflated value would result in you having to buy him out for more. Thirdly because he&amp;#39;ll have a lovely place to live regardless of how long the mortgage takes to pay, whereas you&amp;#39;ll be much more constrained in what you can do with your life until the mortgage is paid off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;if they realise they don’t like living there (as it’s not a great permanent area for a young working couple) they won’t be able to afford to move to a new home without us being forced to sell the place.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They 100% won&amp;#39;t be able to buy another home on that salary if the mortgage on this one is still outstanding.

Again, I&amp;#39;m probably being pedantic, but when fettered he&amp;#39;s actually a worse &lt;em&gt;warrior&lt;/em&gt; than Aragorn is - it&amp;#39;s just he has a whole host of other capabilities besides!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "[**I finally cracked a Carthage campaign!**](https://i.imgur.com/vDjqqkp.jpg) I've had a few [**abortive attempts**](https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/ln44cr/epirus_campaign_review_not_such_a_pyrrhic_victory/) previously but this time I decided to stick with it.  \n\nMy frustrations previously have always pertained to the fairly anaemic starting units Carthage gets, plus the completely invidious starting position, plus the early confrontation with Rome along with a few other factions in Iberia and Africa. I used to find that I'd either push an army to repel Rome and would then lose Carthage to desert factions, or would end up pushed out of the Med entirely while I spent turns and turns and turns roaming around Africa subjugating those factions. Plus the desert kingdoms are overpowered because of the DLC.  \n\nThis time, I mixed things up. I decided to go with the Hannonid Dynasty instead of Hannibal Barca, which felt vaguely disrespectful. But it was absolutely worth it. They get what is described as a minor diplomatic bonus and +5% tax rate. Given that Carthage isn't really despised by many factions early on, that was enough to secure some vital early non-aggression pacts with iberian and African factions, and any greeks I encountered.  Because it was a cultural affinity bonus\n\nBecause Carthage gets 'Client State' instead of 'Satrapy' client states can still independently declare war. This worked in my favour because when Libya and Nova Carthago were attacked or attacked others it pulled me into wars which the other party immediately sought peace on. And with the diplo buff I was able to demand client state status in exchange. This secured Africa and disinclined any of the Iberian factions or Egypt to attack me. Around this time I started to be very well regarded by most factions - [**look at this ridiculous diplomatic sentiment situation**](https://i.imgur.com/sN8S6Jj.png).  \n\nWhich meant I could focus on the typically rabid Rome! I'd been teching to the unfairly-late 'Sidonian Rites' which unlocks all of Carthage's vaguely competent units (pikes, decent hoplites, shock cav, elephants, sword infantry - none of which Carthage gets earlier). Took Magna Graecia, which helped the Etruscans and Massalia to take Italia and kill Rome. Cue defensive alliances with them.  \n\nThen I slowly bit into Iberia by involving into one war at a time. Had a [**slightly weird issue**](https://i.imgur.com/zXda0wm.png) with unit replenishment which resolved itself after a few turns. With a few strategic resources under my belt it started to get very easy to get trade agreements and non-aggression pacts - factions were willing to pay for them. Which was lucky because I had fuck-all money having neglected civil technologies in the rush to decent military units.  \n\nThe culmination of this was an [**even more ridiculously friendly diplomatic picture**](https://i.imgur.com/aJRUPwK.jpeg), in which I had trade relations with every possible faction from the baltic to the black sea, and non-aggression pacts or defensive alliances with everyone else. I think this actually had an impact on the overall level of warfare between the AI factions - this campaign was relatively peaceful and there weren't many truly huge conflicts between big factions.  \n\nAt this point I'm not proud to say I eliminated the remaining African factions (politely, I waited the ten turns after cancelling diplomatic relations!) because I needed to consolidate Africa as a province for income and food. Then consolidated Iberia and had enough Imperium and reserve income to switch to Empire without triggering a civil war (not that that's much of a threat once you [**abuse the marriage mechanic**](https://i.imgur.com/ibOdEQh.png)). Unbelievably, [**this**](https://i.imgur.com/2Wiqjrk.jpeg) was actually more-or-less the greatest extent of my empire. By this point Suebi and Marcomanni were doing angry German things in central europe, Sparta were rather frighteningly steamrolling the Balkans, Ponus was [doing weird stuff](https://i.imgur.com/s0ec2B9.png), and Seleucid were getting punched around by everyone.\n\nNow, *we need to talk about victory conditions*. Carthage gets some really weird ones for the Grand Campaign. Cultural victory conditions were even more obnoxious than usual because of the mandatory settlements, economic wasn't doable because you can't keep enough trade partners without 'Liberate' mechanic. The [**military one**](https://i.imgur.com/Hc3aNFP.png), though, was intriguing. Instead of of settlement requirements it needs 50 ports, along with some achievable provinces, to be directly owned or to be owned by client states or military allies. 50 is not far off the total number of ports in the Med, Black Sea, and Baltic so this was a bit of a challenge.  \n\nBut at this point I had money and an unprecedented amount of diplomatic goodwill. *\"Or through client states and military allies\"*. Hmm.  \n\nSo I went on a diplomatic bender. Used my income of ~20k a turn, in conjunction with buffing diplomacy with agent skills, general attributes (more on that below), and the 'Send Diplomat' political action, to buy military alliances. Over the course of about 10 turns I was able to turn just about every faction with a port into a full military ally. [**Victory, 148BC**](https://i.imgur.com/vDjqqkp.jpg).  \n\n[**This was the final, ridiculous, diplomatic picture**](https://i.imgur.com/MpWUXRh.jpg).  \n\nAnd [**here is the final map with alliances highlighted**](https://imgur.com/a/9G0CWXd).  \n\nPax Carthago indeed.

Their AA (land and ship based) will be much more prepared, and they should be able to get at least 100 aircraft into the air. Might even get some ships partially underway before the Japanese attack arrives.  \n\nAnd that really could be decisive.

Their AA (land and ship based) will be much more prepared, and they should be able to get at least 100 aircraft into the air. Might even get some ships partially underway before the Japanese attack arrives.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that really could be decisive. It&amp;#39;s unlikely that the US manages to save all major ships, but it can probably heavily reduce losses and make sure the Japanese pay heavily in aircraft in exchange.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I cannot get any kind of agreement with any faction - no nonaggression pact, no trade, no alliance; can't even get a peace treaty *where I pay them* while I'm besieging a faction's last city.   \n\nI'm in the green with about half the factions on the map overall, but still can't get any treaties at all. I did manage to get a single small friendly faction to accept a trade agreement for about 9000 in payment, but they cancelled it the following turn (bastards!).  \n\nMy reliability got that low initially due to broken treaties - not war, just cancellation of treaty. but I've not completed any diplomatic action (war against a faction with agreements, broken treaty) since then, so I'd have thought it would have recovered. I've also reaffirmed a few treaties by joining wars with existing defensive allies, which has increased their sentiment to me, but not their disposition to accept trade or anything else.  \n\nWhat I *have* done is used various agents to sabotage a defensive ally substantially (Seleucid). A couple of agent actions a turn on average against their cities and armies. No assassinations. They consequently *fucking hate* me but haven't broken the alliance.  \n\nAnyone have any ideas about whether espionage affects diplomatic reliability in the same way if affects diplomatic sentiment? Is it because Pontus occupies Anatolia which just about every major faction has as a victory condition? Has my campaign just got fucked up somehow?  \n\n\nEDIT: Also;\n\nI have timber, lead, olive oil, wine, iron, and marble trade resources.  \n\nExpansionism malus is at -10  \n\nFaction which likes me most is at +139 - still can't get a non-aggression pact with them for 17k gold  \n\nThrough the 'diplomatic mission' political action (I send my rivals as a way to increase loyalty) I've recently been gifted two settlements by friendly though not allied factions.",

I declared war on the Volcae, and sieged their settlement.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the start of the next turn, Tolosa was occupied by the Gallic Confederation, and my army was idle. The Gallic Confederation is a military ally of mine and hated the Volcae. They had an army which was conceivably in striking distance, but my sieging army didn&amp;#39;t participate in any battle. There&amp;#39;s also nothing on the Faction Records screen about Tolosa being captured.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any ideas how this might have happened?

If I add a Crippling Scope 3 that adds another, identical stun chance on the weapon page.  \n\nBut how does that translate to combat? Is just one of them taken? Does it increase the probability of a single roll to 50%? Does it roll each chance separately and apply them separately? I'm trying to build a really nasty stun-based Atton build to take advantage of his feats, and going with twin upgraded Zabrak blasters with rapid shot is looking pretty good if the effects do stack in any way.\n\nThanks",
