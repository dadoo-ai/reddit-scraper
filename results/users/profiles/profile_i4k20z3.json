Our guy is pretty good at this point, but we’re still using small potties in our living room so he can go when he gets the urge and we have one small\npotty in the bathroom. All our bathrooms do have the kiddy seats and wonder when should we remove the small potties? \n\nLikewise, can someone help me with logistics when eating at a fast casual or fast food restaurant (think Culver’s or Chipotle or Wendy’s) and it’s you and your kiddo and they need to go potty, what do you do? Do you ask someone to watch the food? Try to pack up quickly and bring it in the bathroom? Trash whatever food was uneaten and not worry about it? I struggle with executive functioning and this is still something i struggle with and trying to learn! \n\nLastly, any tips on how to teach kids how to wipe their own butt?

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nI did a YNAB year in review for 2024 and 2023. In both years, our total income is less than our total spending even though we're not in any debt. Do you think this is because of credit cards? We pay off all our credit cards each month - but of course our credit cards are not starting as $0 on Dec 31, 2024 due to payment dates, etc. The other thing i am wondering is we have a \"Savings\" category where YNAB shows we spent xyz dollars from that category. Of course if i do not display it than our Income is greater than spending - could that be a reason why? \n\n  \nI am using the YNAB toolkit if it matters and wonder if this happens to anyone else? If so, how do you reconcile that or work your way through figuring out why this might be happening? \n\n  \nThanks so much!",

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nI WFH and don't use my car that often. In the cold temps in the midwest, of course that can lead to my car battery being depleted when i need it (2009 Honda Civic Si).\n\nI purchased a 12v car Battery tester and got the following results:\n\n* SOH: 75%\n* SOC: 13%\n* R: 7.76 mO\n* CCA: 376 (is 500 CCA when new)\n* 11.90V\n\nI purchased a Viking microprocessor battery charger ([link](https://www.harborfreight.com/2815-amp-automatic-microprocessor-controlled-battery-charger-56796.html)) and when I plugged it in, it says it was at 40% and has been charging since this morning.\n\nIf I understand correctly, it charges fast, and then tapers off.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Is it alright to use this type of charger once a month or so to keep the battery fully charged since I can't seem to drive it enough to charge it?\n2. The manual states when on the car charging to put the negative clamp on a metal chasis, but i never know where to put it and some youtube videos said on the negative terminal is fine (positive on positive and negative on negative). Is this problematic? If it is, can you help me understand where to put the negative terminal on the engine bay? ([engine bay picture](https://preview.redd.it/used-8th-gen-si-missing-engine-bay-front-trim-v0-d2dse20v7tdc1.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d285dc387d19bf7f8d0c813c9a3807b58b45fcd))\n3. I have a Honda battery in there, I assume this is a Standard 12v battery right? Not AGM or GEL or the other options listed?\n4. There is a \"winter mode\" setting on the viking charger that says to use in cold weather, but it doesn't state what this does. Is that the same as charging the battery or meant for something else?\n\nThanks so much for your help!",

As a parent to a 3yo, we've gone through a lot of transitions, and for some reason, i get these intense feelings of sadness. For instance, this morning, my wife threw out some baked pea snacks - and I remember when he would snack on these and I'd be really excited that he likes these snacks. Likewise, he used to love sitting with us and reading or doing puzzles, but now he only wants to read at bedtime (and it went from wanting to sit on us to wanting to sit on his own or even be in his crib as we read). In the moment, I act like I am fine but inside I get tears of sadness and after when he can't see me, I get the choked up feeling in your throat and my eyes get watery - it's like that stage has come to a definitive end before i even know it. I always tend to romanticize the past  and resonate with those gut wrenching quotes of: \"some day, it will be the last time you talk to your friend,\" \"one day, you'll pick up your child for the last time,\" \"you only get xyz # of holidays with your children before they want to spend it with their friends, etc.\" \n\n  \nI ask my wife and she doesn't really get these intense emotions. Sure, sometimes once in a blue it hits her, for me, it feels like almost every week, there is something that I am reminiscing on. \n\n  \nI knew being a dad would be insanely hard - but I was not prepared for the emotional sadness that I feel 10 fold since having a kid than prior to having a child.

I typically go to the dealership for oil changes/fluids and go to local shops for bigger things.\n* Should I just change out the front pad/rotors at Subaru and pay the increased cost and later try to utilize the warranty the next time they need replacements? If I get the front brake pads/rotors replaced at an independent shop, will Subaru be less likely to honor the warranty in the future?\n* Lastly, for the 60k service, I was planning to have them change the spark plugs, differential fluid, brake fluid (depending on what you all advise), and oil change.

Does anyone have any resources for this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cliffs: All this to say, is it possible to reverse our ROTH IRA transaction from August of 2023? If yes, what kind of tax consequences do we face? Would this be a complicated tax situation needing the help of a professional or could we still file with freetaxusa? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My options seem to be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option A: Keep the Roth Contribution as is, file MFJ, and deal with a larger student loan payment for a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option B: If possible, reverse the Roth Contribution from 2023 so that we can keep our student loan payment low, not knowing what kind of tax consequences this proposes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m having a hard time figuring out which option to go with and could use some help! Thank you for your help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The tie rod transmits force from the steering\n&gt; center link or the rack gear to the steering knuckle. This\n&gt; will cause the wheel to turn.

They didn&amp;#39;t pressure me to do it right there, but I was wondering - how serious of an issue is a Tie Rod End Replacement? The cost was $700 for both. On the video they say the grease is fully leaked out on the left front end. They took a video - but their app doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to  save the video, though I was able to grab screenshots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this something I should do asap or something that isn&amp;#39;t a big deal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/9KH6ppI\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/9KH6ppI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the description of what they wrote: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tie Rod End Replacement: tie rod on left front is leaking and due for replacement. rec doing both fronts.\nThe tie rod end is part of the steering mechanism in a\nvehicle. The tie rod transmits force from the steering\ncenter link or the rack gear to the steering knuckle. This\nwill cause the wheel to turn. The outer tie rod end\nconnects with an adjusting sleeve, which allows the\nlength of the tie rod to be adjustable. This adjustment\nis used to set a vehicle’s alignment angle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My previous roles I was in much more quantitative roles - which i did not like. I unfortunately got slotted early as a \"numbers person\" and have had a hard time breaking out of that mold. I still of course have to work a lot with numbers in this role, but it is a little less than before and certainly at the moment, i'm not doing statistical testing or anything.

On the other hand, my guess is that the tech start up is more likely for layoffs, and from visiting the customer success subreddit, it seems to be a very hard time for these folks. So if i get laid off, chances are low i'd find another role.
