This article explains how to add a metric to a dashboard, which is extremely useful but not what I was talking about.\n\nI am talking about is the opposite of this article.. Customers that already have built Tableau sheets and dashboards that report metrics over time and have defined dimensional filters. So in other words open a dashboard, find a metric that should be reported as a Pulse and create a working draft that only I have access to so I can validate, certify and deploy to broader audience.\n\nIn my specific case I want to build and validate my metrics in Tableau and then once signed off, deploy to Pulse. Pulse is purely a plug and play metrics analytics tool that assumes everything you feed it is validated Pulse knocks some standard core concepts like metric \"pacing\" over time out of the park. Executives love it.\n\nSo to re-cap, the problem I am talking about and solving for is not re-creating metrics from scratch but rather bulk creating metrics when I have dashboard in place. The solution today is open tableau on one monitor and open pulse on monitor 2 and click / copy 1 by one.\n\nIt takes 3 minutes to create a new metric so from a time / effort, it's not a problem.

Choose the right use case, start simple and iterate, etc. That was the ground breaking advice... On my phone, I booked my plane trip home before lunch was served... That was only 3 months ago.\n\nThe energy and excitement was at a level 9/10 but the depth I saw among partners and Salesforce folks was a 2/10 and I was okay with that. It was a mixture of pros learning the tech in search of a problem and folks like me that showed up with real problems and customers trying to de-mystify the collection of tools, services, and what is supported / not supported.\n\nPush aside the hype and griping about packaging and price... There is a very solid foundation and platform for building and transformation here.\n\nBack to your point on partners wanting experience and case studies... I agree 100%. If there is big $$$ at stake, my take is choose a partner where Salesforce is not their only competency. Find a partner that has been doing Salesforce / data cloud (not to be confused with Salesforce DataCloud) work for years, has a long history and library of real-world use cases for AI projects.\n\nI am not an integrator selling these services. I have been on other end jumping in as a data leader vetting some partners selling the dream but poised to deliver a nightmare for everyone!\n\nSalesforce didn't invent AI and we (collective technology / software) have had least 18 months to produce real-world LLM powered applications and case studies.\n\nTo your point, it is a buyer's market. I recommend folks don't let Salesforce squeeze you for AgentForce credits if you don't need them.. If companies want to go for it or kick the tires, it's simple enough to make sure everyone on the implementation team has completed the trailheads (even product leaders). Technical implementors are at minimum certified. Review resumes and hold your integrator accountable. If a project goes sideways, you may have found yourself in the same spot I have been... an early adaptor finding the limits of a maturing product.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;THIS is spot on!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was at TDX and they had two top early adopter AgentForce partners get up there and provide guidance for the consultants and partners... Choose the right use case, start simple and iterate, etc. That was the ground breaking advice... On my phone, I booked my plane trip home before lunch was served... That was only 3 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energy and excitement was at a level 9/10 but the depth I saw among partners and Salesforce folks was a 2/10 and I was okay with that. It was a mixture of pros learning the tech in search of a problem and folks like me that showed up with real problems and customers trying to de-mystify the collection of tools, services, and what is supported / not supported.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Push aside the hype and griping about packaging and price... There is a very solid foundation and platform for building and transformation here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to your point on partners wanting experience and case studies... I agree 100%. If there is big $$$ at stake, my take is choose a partner where Salesforce is not their only competency. Find a partner that has been doing Salesforce / data cloud (not to be confused with Salesforce DataCloud) work for years, has a long history and library of real-world use cases for AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not an integrator selling these services. I have been on other end jumping in as a data leader vetting some partners selling the dream but poised to deliver a nightmare for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Salesforce didn&amp;#39;t invent AI and we (collective technology / software) have had least 18 months to produce real-world LLM powered applications and case studies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To your point, it is a buyer&amp;#39;s market. I recommend folks don&amp;#39;t let Salesforce squeeze you for AgentForce credits if you don&amp;#39;t need them.. If companies want to go for it or kick the tires, it&amp;#39;s simple enough to make sure everyone on the implementation team has completed the trailheads (even product leaders). Technical implementors are at minimum certified. Review resumes and hold your integrator accountable. If a project goes sideways, you may have found yourself in the same spot I have been... an early adaptor finding the limits of a maturing product.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
