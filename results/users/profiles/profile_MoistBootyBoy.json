    "communityName": "r/AliensRHere",

    "body": "# Theory Overview:\n\nI’ve been considering a theory that could explain some of the \"shifting\" or \"morphing\" shapes people have been reporting when they observe objects in the sky. My hypothesis is that these observations might be a result of **spacetime distortion** around advanced craft, possibly using **Alcubierre drives** (a theoretical faster-than-light propulsion method).\n\n\n**Here’s the basic idea:**\n\n\nWhen a craft distorts spacetime to achieve near-light-speed or FTL travel, the warping of space around it would alter the way light reaches an observer on Earth. The object itself might not be shape-shifting, but rather the **gravitational lensing effects** caused by the warp bubble could make it appear that way.\n\nThis could explain the bizarre visual phenomena where UFOs seem to change shapes or move erratically. The lensing from spacetime distortion would bend light around the object, giving the appearance of \"morphing\" as the light from the background objects (such as stars) interacts with the warped spacetime.\n\nEven when the craft isn't traveling large distances, if its primary/only means of propulsion is an Alcubierre drive, theoretically even a small shift in space time would cause some gravitational lensing type effects.\n\nGiven that the **Alcubierre drive is purely theoretical** for humans, this phenomenon could point to two possibilities:\n\n1. **Advanced technology** developed by some government, representing the most significant scientific breakthrough in human history, which has been concealed from the public.\n2. **Extraterrestrial visitors** who have mastered spacetime manipulation.\n\nEither scenario is monumental, but if these craft are utilizing Alcubierre-like propulsion, it would explain the erratic movements and the strange way they appear to observers.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\n# Proposed Simulation:\nI’d like to simulate how this phenomenon might look to an observer on Earth. Here’s how I plan to approach the simulation:\n\n## Spacetime Warping and the Alcubierre Metric:\n\n- The Alcubierre drive theoretically creates a “warp bubble” by contracting space in front of the craft and expanding space behind it. The mathematical description involves solving Einstein's field equations, producing a metric where spacetime is warped without requiring vast amounts of mass like black holes.\n- I will model this warp bubble's geometry using the Alcubierre metric: \n\n&gt; _d2^(2) = −c^(2)dt^(2) + (dx − vₛ​(t)f(rₛ​)dt)^(2) + dy^(2) + dz^(2)_\n\nHere, vₛ​(t) is the warp bubble's speed (Assumed near-light), and f(rₛ​) defines the bubble's shape and size.\n\n## Simulating Light Distortion:\n\n- I'll calculate how light rays bend as they pass near this warp bubble. This involves solving the geodesic equations to model how spacetime curvature affects the path of light.\n- Using ray tracing, I'll track how light from distant objects (such as stars) distorts due to the warped spacetime near the drive. This should produce an effect similar to gravitational lensing, where background light is stretched, bent, or even split into multiple images.\n- The simulation would focus on a stationary 20m sphere, viewed by an observer on Earth. If the observer moves slightly (even just by swaying), it could create additional distortion due to changing vantage points.\n\n## Expected Visualization:\n\n- The result would show how a relatively stationary craft with a warp bubble could appear to an observer on Earth. This could include the morphing, shifting, or even disappearing effects many witnesses have described.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\n# Addressing the Light Emission from the Craft:\n\nOne counterargument people may raise is: **if these objects are warping spacetime, why don’t the lights emitted by the craft itself also appear to be distorted?** Here’s my response:\n\n## 1. Light Emission Inside the Warp Bubble:\n\n* One possibility is that the **light emitted by the craft** is **inside the warp bubble**, meaning it wouldn’t be subject to the same spacetime distortions that affect external light. The Alcubierre drive contracts space in front of the bubble and expands it behind, but the region inside the bubble is assumed to remain in **flat, undistorted spacetime**. This would mean any lights on the craft itself might behave normally, as though unaffected by the warping outside the bubble.\n* Therefore, the light could travel in straight lines from the craft to the observer, not experiencing the gravitational lensing effects that affect the external environment.\n\n## 2. Distance from the Warp Boundary:\n\n* The **effect of the warp bubble** on spacetime may be most intense at the boundary of the bubble, but weaken as you move closer to the center. If the lights are positioned **within the center of the bubble**, they may be less influenced by the distortion, creating the appearance of normal, stable lights.\n* This would suggest that **only the light from distant sources** (i.e., background stars) is significantly affected by the extreme curvature near the warp bubble’s edge, while the light from the craft itself would remain largely unaffected.\n\n## 3. Frequency and Redshift Considerations:\n\n* If the lights are emitted from **inside the warp bubble**, we would expect the light's frequency (color) to be subject to **gravitational redshift** or **blueshift** as it escapes the bubble’s warped spacetime. This means that, depending on how the craft is moving relative to the observer, the lights could appear **shifted in color**—either redder or bluer—depending on whether the light is climbing out of or descending into a gravitational potential.\n* However, this shift might not always be noticeable to the naked eye, and the light could still appear stable in terms of shape and position.\n\n## 4. Partial Warping of Light:\n\n* Another possibility is that the **lensing effects could still apply to the craft’s lights**, but at a scale or angle that makes them difficult to detect. The light could experience **some distortion**, but it might be subtle or manifest in ways that are difficult to perceive during brief sightings, or at certain angles. Perhaps what we are interpreting as **stable lights** are actually being warped, just not in ways that are obvious from our limited perspective.\n\n## 5. Speed of Light Relative to the Warp Bubble:\n\n* One key assumption of the Alcubierre drive is that the speed of light remains constant inside the warp bubble. However, the external observer sees the bubble move faster than light by warping spacetime itself. If the lights are emitted from within the bubble, they would still travel at the speed of light within the bubble’s own spacetime, and may not exhibit the **same extreme distortions** that affect external objects. This could explain why they appear as normal lights to the observer.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n# Why This Matters:\nThis simulation could provide circumstantial evidence that some UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena) might be utilizing technology that distorts spacetime. Since the Alcubierre drive has not been realized (at least publicly), this would suggest either:\n\n1. Secret government projects capable of manipulating spacetime for near-light-speed travel.\n2. Non-human intelligence visiting Earth with propulsion systems beyond our current understanding.\n\nBoth scenarios raise profound questions, but simulating the visual effects of such a technology is a testable step towards understanding what people are observing in the sky. While this wouldn’t conclusively prove the existence of Alcubierre drives, it would offer a plausible explanation for the strange morphing behaviors reported.\n\nI believe this approach can at least provide a theoretical framework for understanding how these craft, or UFOs, could appear from the perspective of someone on Earth. It’s a start, and while we might still be far from practical Alcubierre drives, these lensing effects could help explain part of the UFO mystery.\n\nThoughts? I'd love feedback on improving the simulation or hearing from anyone with experience in gravitational lensing or general relativity simulations. Let’s test this theory and see what can be learned!",
