There&amp;#39;s one person in charge of monitoring when the project goes live. We&amp;#39;re stuck using Excel and can&amp;#39;t use Microsoft Project, but want to create something similar to the Predecessors and Successors that Project utilises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, Column A has a Task Number (a unique String), Column B as predecessors (eg. Task T04 cannot start without task T03 being completed). Column B is manually populated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Column C is the successors, and it is the formula that I&amp;#39;m struggling with. I&amp;#39;ve used &lt;a href=\"https://exceljet.net/formula/extract-multiple-matches-into-separate-columns\"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; as a base to get some code, and it works...somewhat. Like the example on the website it only returns a single value. Ideally I&amp;#39;d want my formula to return a string containing a list of each dependency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this is possible, and it&amp;#39;s a matter of using the wrong software for the wrong task, but any help would be very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

So it does that 4 times with a 6 second cooldown. +23% fire damage from items, and the passive that adds 15% damage to enemies within 15 yards, and I&amp;#39;m in an explosive heaven. (I don&amp;#39;t have any individual gear with +explosive blast damage, that&amp;#39;s next on my list)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reasonably comfortably doing Torment 2 for Act 1 bounties now running around and doing lots of Critical Hit damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would probably not have tried to incorporate Explosive Blast into a build if it wasn&amp;#39;t for this drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
