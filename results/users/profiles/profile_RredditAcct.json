If you buy your batteries at an RV place (which will cost more) they will probably do it.  That being said, replacing them is no problem.  You'll need to check how your cables are connected to your batteries, either by a nut or a wingnut, and plan accordingly.  My only rule of thumb is positive on first and off last.  Also, the damn batteries weight a ton.\n\nDuring the winter, I take my batteries out and keep them on a trickle charger that has a setting for deep cycle. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bx0na9makflf1.jpeg?width=1152&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d5c678ecf5acf9dbf28ea69b53be281a5290051",

I would stick w/ the same size 31 deep cycle when replacing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also took several photos of the wiring before replacing it.  I used post-it notes w/ scotch tape to identify where the wires go. I also drew a diagram on a Post-it note (I&amp;#39;ll try to attach).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Replacing the batteries is no problem, but I don&amp;#39;t think a normal auto shop will do it for you.  If you buy your batteries at an RV place (which will cost more) they will probably do it.  That being said, replacing them is no problem.  You&amp;#39;ll need to check how your cables are connected to your batteries, either by a nut or a wingnut, and plan accordingly.  My only rule of thumb is positive on first and off last.  Also, the damn batteries weight a ton.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the winter, I take my batteries out and keep them on a trickle charger that has a setting for deep cycle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any other questions.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bx0na9makflf1.jpeg?width=1152&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5d5c678ecf5acf9dbf28ea69b53be281a5290051\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bx0na9makflf1.jpeg?width=1152&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5d5c678ecf5acf9dbf28ea69b53be281a5290051&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

My thought process is that I could plug my camper into the Jackery just like I would to shore power.  This would allow me to use my outlets in my camper and charge my camper 12V batteries. \n\nThe Jackery can charge either by solar panels or via 12v inside my truck while driving.  My back seat even has a 12v connector I can use.\n\nObviously, another advantage is that I can bring the Jackery inside my home if the power goes out.\n\nAre there any disadvantages?  I haven't priced out a new solar system for my camper; however, I can't image it being cheaper than a 1K watt Jackery (would that be enough?).

However, there were 2 issues that were deal breakers for me: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1:  Auto starts when Android Auto starts.  I searched and can&amp;#39;t find a way to prevent this.  This is something Apple would do.  I didn&amp;#39;t turn this feature on and now I can&amp;#39;t find a way to turn it off.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2:  I can&amp;#39;t share my route when using Waze.  Again, am I missing something?  Google Maps is not too smooth w/ this feature; however, at least they have it.  I use this all the time when picking up family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has easy ways to fix this (not some detailed workaround that I have to do every time I use Waze) I will go back.
