    "body": "We are a financial services business using Financial Services Cloud and I'm in the early stages of planning for the next iteration of our customer portal. Essentially, I've come to the conclusion that we shouldn't go the Experience Cloud route, but I'd appreciate some validation (or otherwise) from the community here before I get too far down the path.\n\nSF is essentially our core system. We use it to manage most elements of the customer, but we do have a couple of other key systems. One in particular essentially manages the customer's account including transactions, balances, taxes etc. We integrate this system with Salesforce and share some data between the two, but at least for now we are not brining transaction level data to Salesforce, just things like daily balances.\n\nOur current customer portal is a PHP/Laravel based application we had built about 5 years ago and at the moment are essentially just going framework &amp; security upgrades. It's OK, but fairly basic and really just gives the customer a view of their account/transactions and some charts over time. The plan is to expand the functionality significantly including (but not limited to) things like approvals of documents, secure messaging, balance projections and a number of other features. We also want to build out mobiles apps with the majority of the functionality. \n\nThe current portal has built in authentication (part of the Laravel framework), but has been setup so that we provision users within Salesforce, and their Relationship Group membership in Salesforce determines what accounts they see.\n\nOur Salesforce partner is pushing for us move to Experience Cloud going forward, but I have some major reservations, particularly around cost. We're willing and able to make a significant investment in a new or upgraded portal, but I want to test my current view that we should keep building on what we already have rather than start over with Experience Cloud.\n\nI understand that EC can be very easy to build out functionality, but I believe a number of the features we have today or want in future would likely need a lot of custom LWC development. I'm thinking about TCO and while, perhaps, getting the functionality we want built on EC may cost less upfront, the licencing model seems extreme to me. \n\nI do (I think) understand the licencing model, and while we have a good proportion of customers who log in a lot so would suit the user licence model and other infrequent users who may suit per-login, this can be a bit unpredictable. For example, we may have a user who rarely logs on, but then is expecting a transaction so might log in 20 times in a day trying to see that transaction land. Or we may have big spikes around tax time or even certain financial transactions or market events that mean that an infrequent user suddenly becomes a very frequent user for a period of days or weeks - but this isn't always easy to predict accurately. I'm worried that unless we licence all or most of our users at a user licence level, we could easily get caught out with a massive blowout in per-login costs. A major stock market movement could easily see 100's or 1000's of additional logins from our otherwise irregular portal using customers wanting to see the impact to their accounts.\n\nFor what we want to be able to do, I believe we would need Experience Cloud+ for Financial Services Cloud licences, which list at $35/user/month for unlimited logins of $15/login (Which just seems extreme to me!). For our number of users, that would push licence costs alone well into 7-figures for us each year. I know we could get this down, possibly a lot, via our AE - but at the same time our current portal costs us about 3% of that to run, and we'll have to spend a fair bit on a new build either way. But, even if we ended up getting the price down to, say, $300k a year for licencing, I expect that the EC solution would end up at a higher TCO in a very short timespan. \n\nAt $420/user/year to cover login costs for users - what am I getting over what we could build ourselves that effectively has a 'login' cost per user of $0? I'm really struggling to see how us, or anyone, makes the ROI work for EC outside of anonymous sites. We are not a large org - couple of thousand customers and about 60 staff, so we don't really have the scale or spend with Salesforce to negotiate down the licence costs anywhere near as much as a large org would. We were also fairly early adopters of FSC and our per user cost is a fraction of the current list price. Our AE likes to remind us of this and tells us (may or may not be true) that they have no other customers on FSC as cheap as we have it. We have also have a 9% uplift on the last two renewals, and when we have pushed back they tell us that there is no room to negotiate as we are on such a good rate already, so I feel any attempt to negotiate EC licences to a level that would be tolerable to us won't be to SF. Back of the envelope is that they would need to discount by about 90% for it to make the TCO over 5 years favorable to EC.",

    "body": "We have recently installed an LG 75UL3J-B Digital Signage display in one of our meeting rooms and installed a Microsoft Teams Room system. This is the only input used for the display, and when there is no active meeting and when there is no presence detected in the room it currently goes into standby.\n\nIdeally, instead of going into Standby I'd like to play a short video on a loop, but only during office hours (9-5 M-F) and outside of those times, have the display go into standby when there is no HDMI input. Is this possible? Playing around I think I can get it to play the video instead of standby when there is no signal input, but this seems to be a 24/7 thing. I can't use a schedule to turn on/off the display, as there will be occasions where we have early/late meetings in the room and I can't have it just turning off. The standby setting also seems a little unreliable - with some testing even with it set sometimes I would come into the room after it had been empty for a while to find it playing the video, and other times it would be in standby. It also seemed to force the timeout setting from the 10 seconds I had set on no input to 20 minutes. If I changed the 20 minutes to something else, it would just immediately change back.\n\nWe don't have any digital signage server running. It's only one room at this stage so I'd prefer not to deploy a server just for this, but could if that was a way around it - but a paid solution is probably not worth it.\n\nThe other thing I would like to do, if possible, is hide the OSD that appears when the display comes back from standby. At the moment, after the display wakes it comes up with the input banner and a massive \"Energy Star\" logo in the corner. Is there any way to disable those OSD messages? There is nothing I can find in the settings, which are very limited and I can't seem to find any accessible service menu for these displays.",

Before I joined, there was already a project underway to rollout Keeper as the enterprise password management solution. Since then, I've struggled to get it working how I want/would expect. It hasn't been super high on my priority list but I'd like to get some clarity on the following challenges to be certain if the issues are the product or my understanding of it. I've previously used Bitwarden, so some of my expectation comes from how that product works.\n\n1) TOTP codes in the browser extension. We've rolled out the browser extension via GPO and we don't want to have users use a desktop app (more trouble than it's worth). But there seems to be no way to add a TOTP code to a record in the browser extension. If the TOTP code is already on the record, the browser extension shows it fine, but I have to open the web vault to add the code. When creating a record or editing a record in the broswer extension for a record without a TOTP code, there is simply nowhere to add it. Am I missing something, or is this a current product limitation? If users have to open the web vault to add them, this is a confusing pattern they have to learn and will not go down well/cause additional support requests.\n\n2) Adding a new record using browser extension, like the TOTP code about, there seems to be no way to select a folder at the time the record is created. Again, am I missing something? Even editing it's not there, so I have to open the web vault to be able to move a record to a folder. This is hugely frustrating. \n\nFor 1 and 2 above, these are fairly common and basic tasks that I am struggling to understand why they aren't present in the browser extension. \n\n3) Shared Folders. I've been trying to get my head around the shared folders permission structures and if I understand correctly, there is a serious limitation on how these can be permissioned. What we wanted, and understood was possible, was that certain users (Say a manager of a function) could have permissions on a shared folder to be able to manage users and records, while other users in the share would have view only. But it seems we either need to make the Managers 'Share Admins' at a node role level, or enable the edit/delete permission for the whole folder. But if we make someone a Share Admin, they are then a Share Admin for ANY shared folder they are a member of, right? In all these cases, we end up with users who have more permissions that we want them to in one way or another. Is my understanding correct, or is there a way to do this that I am missing?",
