Honestly if you're not looking for anything too technical you can get this job pretty easily. \n\nThe job is pretty much just troubleshooting Salesforce issues and the most \"technical\" stuff is knowing how to use SQL but even then, they already have pre-made SQL  queries to use. Knowing where everything is to help you troubleshoot is the biggest challenge because Salesforce hates keeping everything in one place fml. \n\nIf your more introverted then this job might not be the best considering you have to talk to customers. Management micromanages you and some holidays like voting day is mandatory because we have customers who don't have that day off either 😒\n\nAt least you get to work remote for 2/5 days of the week.\n\nI'm an introvert so I hate the job but the pay is pretty good for the midwest cost of living",
