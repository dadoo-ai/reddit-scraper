The Diamond rep said only Amex could reinstate it and transfered me to Amex. The Amex rep said they only report spend to Hilton and it&amp;#39;s up to Hilton to provide a comp status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called Hilton back, the first rep transferred me to the Diamond desk. The Diamond rep said they can only do a Fastrack which requires 18 nts over 90 days. You need to call in 24 hrs before your upcoming reservation to ensure it&amp;#39;s counted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
