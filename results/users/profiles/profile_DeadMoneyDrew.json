    "body": "Yesterday I finally succeeded in getting a Waymo ride on Uber in Atlanta, after trying on close to 50 occasions and cancelling countless ride matches with Uber human drivers. Success arrived in my lap at last, and I ended up getting two rides. Now I have a video that is twice as long as what I'd expected as a best case. Ha.\n\nI live just a few blocks outside the service area, so I set out for a long run towards Midtown Atlanta with plans to stop at various intersections and try to get a Waymo to Georgia Tech.\n\nFirst attempt was from Madison Yards. I spent probably 15 minutes requesting and cancelling Ubers, at one point being matched with the same human driver 3 times in row. Boo. No good from here.\n\nNext attempt was from Reynoldstown just before the Krog Street Tunnel. I tried all of the various suggested Uber ride types at least once. Humans every time. I think I canceled 7 rides.\n\nNext attempt was from Edgewood &amp; Krog Street. No dice. 4 humans in a row. \n\nI tried a couple more times from around Krog Street Market. Still all humans. I figured I might be better served to run all the way to Georiga Tech and then try for a Waymo home, since that's in the center of the service area.\n\nAlong the way I ended up stopping at the toilets at Old Fourth Ward Skate Park. I thought, gosh wouldn't it be funny if I got matched with a Waymo back here where there is little traffic and no one to witness? Boom, instant Waymo match, on the first try. Ha.\n\nI rode the Waymo down to Georiga Tech, roughly a 3 mile ride. Traffic was light and there were only a handful of pedestrians, but it was a good ride and I got some attention from onlookers. The people in the pickup truck said that I was being driven around by the ghost of John Cena. The lady in the red shirt said that I was a \"brave man\" and laughed. She and her friend with the walker were crossing down to where I got dropped off, and we chatted for a bit afterward. Both ladies were very nice and were inquisitive and intrigued by the Waymo. One of them commented that she was impressed at how the Waymo used its turn signals and yielded appropriately. As I left they were talking with some newly arrived people about the driverless car they'd just seen ferrying me around. \n\nI continued a rather meandering running path back in the direction of my neighborhood, figuring I might as well see if I could get another Waymo along the way. No dice on numerous attempts in Midtown, no luck from numerous attempts around Piedmont Park. Eventually I ended up running out to Ansley Mall, and I figured I would try one more time. Nope, 5 humans in a row.\n\nThen I thought, ha! What if the secret is Old Fourth Ward Skate Park? I set that as the destination instead of a dropoff closer to my house. Boom, instant Waymo. Ok then!\n\nSame as previously, this trip was roughly 3 miles. Also, both trips were priced around $11 as the cheapest option. Some of us on this sub have prognosticated that selecting a short, cheap ride may give a better chance of getting matched with a Waymo, since regular Uber drivers are less likely to be interested in the trip.\n\nSo off I went, and now I have a 12 minute video instead of one half that length.\n\nAfter getting dropped off I continued on my run, and along the way I encountered someone else getting dropped off by a Waymo. That made the first time I'd seen a Waymo carrying a passenger other than yours truly. I exchanged pleasantries with the man and told him I'd just gotten my first Atlanta Waymo ride. He smiled. If the dude in the Bucc-ee's shirt who got dropped off along the Beltline yesterday is in this sub, howdy!\n\nAlright now. My Atlanta nerd ride is done. Now I can go back to not cancelling Uber rides dozens of times a day.",

Every individual was pushed to maintain six feet of personal space, limit indoor gatherings, and wear a mask in public. \n\n&gt;This flexing of governmental muscle created a common enemy that allowed Republicans and libertarians to bond at unprecedented levels. That was nowhere more apparent than in New Hampshire, where the anti-mask sentiment was, like a boor’s flatulence, both loud and proud. \n\n&gt;The stage was set. Over three short acts, a uniquely American tragedy unfolded in the legislative statehouse. Act 1 took place on November 20. Having just won control of the state legislature, a group of Republicans asserted their commitment to freedom by gathering indoors, mostly maskless, at a ski resort. One of them, a realtor named Dick Hinch, lauded Republicans who refused to wear masks as patriots and the “freedom group.” Admiringly, they asked Hinch to be their leader. He accepted. \n\n&gt;Act 2 took place on December 1. Hinch, facing fire from Democrats and the press, admitted that “a very small number” of Republicans who had attended the ski resort gathering had come down with COVID-19. The following day Hinch was formally voted in as House Speaker by the full legislature. \n\n&gt;Act 3 took place on December 9. Having led the House for barely more than a week, Hinch died of COVID-19. Five days later, the federal government released the first shipment of a coronavirus vaccine to the public. \n\n&gt;The irony of the drama would have been comic if it wasn’t so sad.\n\n&gt;Though New Hampshire’s statehouse provided an unusually neat example of a person dying over a principled stand against masking, variations on the same dynamic were happening all across the country. That very November a team led by Yale researcher Anton Gollwitzer used publicly available data to demonstrate that people in deep-red counties were catching and dying of COVID-19 at higher rates than other Americans, even when accounting for other factors. \n\n&gt;With the mask debate adding life-and-death urgency to partisanship, observers, including political journalist Tom Elias, drew on historical examples to make the case that the pandemic was creating a state of instability that opened the door to secession. And indeed, New Hampshire’s secessionists were delighted to learn that the issue of sovereignty was at long last finding a place in the hearts of millions of Americans. Polls in September 2020 and March 2021 found that between 30 and 40 percent of Americans favored secession, up sharply from the 24 percent a Reuters poll had found six years earlier. \n\n&gt;These and many other signs of secessionism convinced me that I needed to learn more about New Hampshire’s local movement. I began to reach out to secessionists, seeking an interview. I wound up approaching Dave Ridley.",

I'm sitting here sipping on a Glencairn of Wilderness Trail Single Barrel that I picked up while in Kentucky a few weeks back. I came across it while out one night in Louisville, did a quick check of this subreddit and found some positive reviews of it, and decided to give it a try. I liked it, so I grabbed a bottle on my way home. It's got some nice kick and a decent flavor.\n\nI ended up having a funny and slightly confusing conversation with a fellow bourbon shopper while buying this bottle. I'm relatively new to bourbons and seem to have become a fan at a time of market silliness. I was at a Liquor Barn somewhere south of Louisville just browsing the large bourbon aisle when a man came in apparently in search of a bottle of Blanton's. I wasn't looking for anything in particular, but rather perusing the products and looking for bourbons that I've never seen in Atlanta or for something at a cheaper price that what I pay at my hometown stores. Perhaps he took that as me searching high and low for a specific brand. \n\nRoughly the following conversation ensued.\n\nHim: Man, I just can't ever find anything any more.\n\nMe: What's that?\n\nHim: I guess all the good stuff sells out as soon as they put it on the shelf.\n\nMe, motioning to the really long and high row of bourbons: Hmm, looks like they have quite a bit of stuff here.\n\nHim: Yeah but there's no Blanton's. Damn.\n\nMe: Sir, I'm just a caveman. Your world frightens and confuses me.\n\nOkay, I really didn't say that, but I damned sure thought it, in Phil Hartman's voice.\n\nMe: Yeah, I guess not. But there's plenty of other stuff.\n\nHim: (something under his breath about this being a huge waste of time and bad luck)\n\nMe: What?\n\nThe man scowled and spun a hard about-face while waving his hand dismissively at the entire bourbon selection, all the while still muttering about no Blanton's and to hell with this.\n\nOoookay. No Blanton's, so to hell with all bourbon! Lol.\n\nThere's certainly no wrong bourbon to drink, and no wrong way of drinking it. I don't begrudge anyone for their tastes. In fact, I'll let everybody pass up on all other options while searching for their unicorn bourbon or whatever bourbon is flying off the shelves at a given moment, because that means more bourbon for me!\n\nI picked up the aforementioned bottle of Wilderness Trail and a bottle of New Riff Rye, which I had tried at my hotel's bar a few nights prior. To my knowledge neither of those are available in Atlanta, and I now have two unique-to-the-area bottles behind my home bar.\n\nThanks again for the reviews, and keep them coming! Cheers.",

She has been seen near the Mavell Road Trailhead at Silver Comet Mile 0, near the Publix on South Cobb Drive, and near the Bike Depot at Silver Comet Mile 4.5\n\nPlease call or text 404-414-5784 if you see Bailey. A picture and a GPS location would help.

Do you recognize this IP address in the whitelist? XX.255.XXX.3?\n\nI didn't recognize the IP, but there was a note from a former employee of ours indicating that he had added it to the whitelist. No other details than that, though.\n\n**Me**: Hmmm, looks like we added that IP, but I don't recognize it.  I don't think it's from our data center but I have no idea what it is. Why?\n\n**Patty**: Slick Willie came by earlier and asked me about it. He's cleaning up the whitelist. I told him I'd look into it and let him know if it's safe to delete it.\n\n**Me**: I'd message the network team and ask them about it. If it's not one of our IPs then it's probably safe to delete.\n\n**Patty**: Sure, thanks. Hey, can we look at this other issue blah blah blah...\n\nWe went on to looking at something else, but then I saw a popup preview of an email from Slick Willie on Patty's screen, and I caught a few words that concerned me.\n\n**Me**: Uhhh, Patty? Open that email that you just got from Slick Willie. \n\nShe opened it and found more or less this:\n\n**Slick Willie**: Patty, per our conversation, IP address XX.255.XXX.3 is not relevant, and I can delete it from the whitelist. Thanks.\n\n**Me**: Ohhhh. If that's one of our IPs, and he deletes it from the list, it could cause an outage. Or at minimum a service degradation. Not cool.\n\n**Patty**: let out a string of obscenities that would make Samuel L. Jackson kneel and pray. Okay, not really, but she was frustrated.\n\n**Patty**: Ohhh, that guy! He doesn't listen and he doesn't think. I told him to WAIT until I did some research and that I'd get back to him.\n\nShe went on to say that Slick Willie was constantly pressuring her on tasks and that he was always trying to shift blame to her or to one of our other remote-based techs when things went to shit.\n\n**Me**: Reply just to him. Tell him nicely but clearly that he misunderstood. You do NOT give permission to delete that IP from the whitelist because you don't know what it is. If he deletes it and it's critical then an outage could occur. Repeat that you'll do further research and get back to him, but that he is NOT to do anything until you say so. Then forward the email that you send to Slick Willie to the account manager and let him know what's going on.\n\nLater I heard that the account manager called Slick Willie's boss and let the boss know that Slick Willie was possibly out and about deleting things from the production environment without first understanding what they are.

Occasionally I get pulled into a Tech Support matter if the case is tricky or if the Support team is in the weeds. But if you want Tech Support, don't call me. \n\nWe have one client whose people constantly do things like ask our Sales team for updates on outstanding production support issues, or on their regular Support review call bring up change requests for projects that I'm working on, or during project calls tell me that they are still waiting on a Purchase Order from Sales. These Confused Individuals have no understanding of how different departments handle different functions. They have been told this many many times. We have told them both verbally and in writing \"For Production Support issues or for simple questions about things that you are trying to do with our software, follow the established Support Ticket procedure. Do not contact DeadMoneyDrew, or his boss, or anyone else on the project team, or the Sales team. Contact Support through our website.\" This has fallen on deaf ears.\n\nThe other day we had a scheduled meeting to review the QA results of our current project. It was me, my Project Manager, and another technician from our team on our side, and it was ConfusedPerson and BefuddledPerson on the client side. The meeting started and I started the clock. This was billable! Support is included in their monthly fee. My time is NOT included in their monthly fee and is billed at an hourly rate to a project. Multiply that times 3 since there were 3 of us on the call.\n\n**ConfusedPerson**: First defect is that CUSTOMER ENROLLMENT FORM isn't working. There is a field that isn't pulling the value that we want and is throwing an error.\n\n**Me**: Um, ConfusedPerson I'm confused. I've never heard of CUSTOMER ENROLLMENT FORM so I don't think it's in scope for this project.\n\n**BefuddledPerson**: Sure, we've been working on this for two weeks and we need it done.\n\n**Project Manager**: okay, let's clear this up. We called this meeting to discuss the outstanding defects on the current project and we sent an agenda of items that you've reported. This is not one of the reported defects.\n\n**ConfusedPerson**: well we added this to the list.\n\n**Project Manager**: yeah, that's not how an agenda works.\n\nMeanwhile the PM and the other tech are I are both Skype messaging each other and asking \"what the hell are they talking about?\" None of us knew.\n\n**ConfusedPerson**: we were working with Sue on this and we got this far but it still isn't working.\n\n**Me**: Hold on. You were working with Sue. Sue is on our Support team. We are not the Support team.\n\n**BefuddledPerson**: yes, but we still need help with this because it isn't working for us and yadda yadda yadda\n\n**Project Manager**: folks, this is not an issue for this project. This is a Support matter. If you have an open Support request and have been working with Sue, then you need to communicate with her about any further assistance that you need. We aren't going to have any information for you on this.\n\nArguing commences. We reached the 15 minute mark on the timer and still hadn't gotten them to focus on the actual in-scope project defects. On Skype the PM told us \"let them keep arguing and note how much time we burn.\"\n\nSomewhere in there, I noticed an obvious problem in the field that was erroring out. I figured I would point them in the right direction and it would shut them up. Nope. Big mistake.\n\n**Me**: okay, guys, you have an error in the formula that's in that field. You have an IF function with an invalid condition. It works just like an IF function in Excel. IF(condition, value if true, value if false). Right now you just have a text field from your database. That's not a valid conditional statement. The condition must evaluate to either TRUE or FALSE.\n\n**ConfusedPerson** and **BefuddledPerson** remained Confused and Befuddled, so I banged out a quick example and put it in the chat.\n\n**Me**: here, see the chat. That's an example that will evaluate to TRUE if that field has a value, and FALSE if it doesn't.\n\nAnd we then made another attempt to start discussing the actual project.\n\n**ConfusedPerson**: so what if that's not our requirement?\n\n**Me**: sigh, look on our tech support guides on our website for articles about how to write an IF function. What I just gave you is just an example.\n\n**BefuddledPerson**: so what is the condition that we want to check?\n\nDead silence. 30 seconds later the **other technician** on the call pipes in \"are you telling me that you've asked for help in writing a conditional formula, and you don't even know what conditions you want met? We don't have that information. That's for you to decide internally.\"\n\nCommence more arguing, only this time it was **ConfusedPerson** and **BefuddledPerson** arguing among themselves. They hit the 30 minute mark before finally deciding to take the matter offline.\n\nGrrrrrr. Thirty minutes of wasted time. The Project Manager crafted an email to the customer's PM with copy to their internal Tech Support director and also the overall program owner. He attached both the Support process document that they should know by heart and the Statement of Work for the current project, he included many phrases such as \"it is imperative that we stay disciplined in our project meetings,\" and he put in large bold font a comparison of what would be billed to the current project (**hourly rate / 2 times 3 people**) versus what would have been billed if they had followed the Support process (**$0, of course!**)\n\nI moseyed over to Sue's area and clued her in about our little shitshow of a meeting. She gave me the biggest eyeroll that I've seen in ages and said \"yeah, I've already explained to both of them that they can't write an IF statement without a Boolean condition. And they also asked me what their own requirements were.\"\n\nYeah. You want Tech Support? Call Tech Support. Duh. And maybe sort out in advance exactly what the hell you plan to ask.",

We called this meeting to discuss the outstanding defects on the current project and we sent an agenda of items that you&amp;#39;ve reported. This is not one of the reported defects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ConfusedPerson&lt;/strong&gt;: well we added this to the list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Manager&lt;/strong&gt;: yeah, that&amp;#39;s not how an agenda works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the PM and the other tech are I are both Skype messaging each other and asking &amp;quot;what the hell are they talking about?&amp;quot; None of us knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ConfusedPerson&lt;/strong&gt;: we were working with Sue on this and we got this far but it still isn&amp;#39;t working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Hold on. You were working with Sue. Sue is on our Support team. We are not the Support team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BefuddledPerson&lt;/strong&gt;: yes, but we still need help with this because it isn&amp;#39;t working for us and yadda yadda yadda&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Manager&lt;/strong&gt;: folks, this is not an issue for this project. This is a Support matter. If you have an open Support request and have been working with Sue, then you need to communicate with her about any further assistance that you need. We aren&amp;#39;t going to have any information for you on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arguing commences. We reached the 15 minute mark on the timer and still hadn&amp;#39;t gotten them to focus on the actual in-scope project defects. On Skype the PM told us &amp;quot;let them keep arguing and note how much time we burn.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in there, I noticed an obvious problem in the field that was erroring out. I figured I would point them in the right direction and it would shut them up. Nope. Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: okay, guys, you have an error in the formula that&amp;#39;s in that field. You have an IF function with an invalid condition. It works just like an IF function in Excel. IF(condition, value if true, value if false). Right now you just have a text field from your database. That&amp;#39;s not a valid conditional statement. The condition must evaluate to either TRUE or FALSE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ConfusedPerson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;BefuddledPerson&lt;/strong&gt; remained Confused and Befuddled, so I banged out a quick example and put it in the chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: here, see the chat. That&amp;#39;s an example that will evaluate to TRUE if that field has a value, and FALSE if it doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we then made another attempt to start discussing the actual project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ConfusedPerson&lt;/strong&gt;: so what if that&amp;#39;s not our requirement?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: sigh, look on our tech support guides on our website for articles about how to write an IF function. What I just gave you is just an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BefuddledPerson&lt;/strong&gt;: so what is the condition that we want to check?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dead silence. 30 seconds later the &lt;strong&gt;other technician&lt;/strong&gt; on the call pipes in &amp;quot;are you telling me that you&amp;#39;ve asked for help in writing a conditional formula, and you don&amp;#39;t even know what conditions you want met? We don&amp;#39;t have that information. That&amp;#39;s for you to decide internally.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Commence more arguing, only this time it was &lt;strong&gt;ConfusedPerson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;BefuddledPerson&lt;/strong&gt; arguing among themselves. They hit the 30 minute mark before finally deciding to take the matter offline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grrrrrr. Thirty minutes of wasted time. The Project Manager crafted an email to the customer&amp;#39;s PM with copy to their internal Tech Support director and also the overall program owner. He attached both the Support process document that they should know by heart and the Statement of Work for the current project, he included many phrases such as &amp;quot;it is imperative that we stay disciplined in our project meetings,&amp;quot; and he put in large bold font a comparison of what would be billed to the current project (&lt;strong&gt;hourly rate / 2 times 3 people&lt;/strong&gt;) versus what would have been billed if they had followed the Support process (&lt;strong&gt;$0, of course!&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moseyed over to Sue&amp;#39;s area and clued her in about our little shitshow of a meeting. She gave me the biggest eyeroll that I&amp;#39;ve seen in ages and said &amp;quot;yeah, I&amp;#39;ve already explained to both of them that they can&amp;#39;t write an IF statement without a Boolean condition. And they also asked me what their own requirements were.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah. You want Tech Support? Call Tech Support. Duh. And maybe sort out in advance exactly what the hell you plan to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
