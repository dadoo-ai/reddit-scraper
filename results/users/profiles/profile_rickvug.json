The sense that I get is that the Bent Court Study area is an extremely low priority for the city given the small amount of land, the complexity, and the city's desire to keep much of character homes in some form. They have their hands full with all of the new provincial changes which should keep staff busy for a few more years still.\n\nWhat I bet the city wants is for the developer to foot the bill for study area planning. Given the amount of (newly) developable land out there with far more certainty and without heritage retention requirements, I'm not sure why any developer would want to pay for this extra planning process, especially given the time it will take and financing. That would all need to be discounted out of the purchase price. Perhaps over a very long time horizon (decades) maybe the owners of these homes might get lucky with development conditions improving and the city finally getting around to the study. Until then you're sitting around waiting with no certainty. Huge opportunity cost and also probably a depressed value given the lack of certainty for end users.\n\nJust my 2 cents, take it for what it is worth. Not a developer but have a reasonable understanding and I've also been approached for land assembly myself (I turned down involvement). u/Adventurous-Ad7527 if you are one of the land owners and you are looking to pull together an assembly sooner rather than later perhaps an angle to explore would be selling to a non-profit provider of affordable housing. The city prioritizes these applications with greater flexibility. I bet those study area constraints could go away quite quickly if they were motived. Even without redevelopment the houses and the location is well suited for adaptive re-use (eg. co-op housing).",

I'm very much pro pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure, including bike lanes. However if I'm being honest about it, I see a low volume of cyclists compared to pedestrians on most routes. The Agnes Greenway is an excellent example. It is busy greenway for pedestrians, particularly around school times. Given the low volume of cyclists, would it make sense to have a shared path (perhaps with a line to divide the space) to give a bit more breathing room for the pedestrian majority? Or is it warranted to keep cyclists clearly separated, especially if usage picks up as the network grows? Politically, I wonder if it is more feasible to put in a bunch of MUPs vs. bike lanes (not that this should be the determining factor).\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts on this one.",
