Some concerts will have standing area right near the stage, and it looks like this concert has that.\n\nThe reality is, for floor seats, even when you have an assigned seat, most people stand for the show and you won't see much if you sit down.\n\nFor the other photo you posted, you should be able to zoom in and see the specific seat, but I'm surprised the photo does show more than a row number. Usually there is a row and seat number.\n\nIf I'm splurging for floor seats, I usually try and get something on the aisle. They tend to have better sight lines, and I feel less claustrophobic.\n\nI had a buddy who lucked out and got in to the standing area by the stage for the Rolling Stones. I'm pretty sure he got some Mick Jagger sweat on him. Worth every penny.\n\nEnjoy the show!",

Beer with lunch, a couple more by the pool, take another for a walk to the room... Wine for dinner... Drinks at the bar until late.\n\nDay 2 - Sea Day - Pina coladas in the hot tub to start...

Even if I'd be happy without a drink. \n\nDay 6 - sea day - went to a pool that didn't allow drinks in it. It was nice. Had a couple beers during the day, and a glass of wine at dinner, but would have been just as happy without them.\n\nDay 7 - one more day. Do I have to drink today? Of course I do.

It&amp;#39;s only day 3 after all! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 4-5 - port days, and now I&amp;#39;m feeling the grind. I don&amp;#39;t really want to drink. But it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s hard to resist. Gotta make the most of it... Even if I&amp;#39;d be happy without a drink. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 6 - sea day - went to a pool that didn&amp;#39;t allow drinks in it. It was nice. Had a couple beers during the day, and a glass of wine at dinner, but would have been just as happy without them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 7 - one more day. Do I have to drink today? Of course I do. It&amp;#39;s the last night on board. But I&amp;#39;ll be glad to get home and not feel the pressure to drink for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But he's not a night owl, and the concert running until 11pm on a school night put him in a bad mood.\n\nBut my daughter, who had no interest in Pink Floyd, absolutely loved the show. She recently read 1984, and the Orwellian themes caught her attention. She immediately spotted a quote from 1984 used by Roger on one of the screens.\n\nTwo days after the show, I heard her playing 'Comfortably Numb' on the piano. She really liked the haunting version Roger used in the show.\n\nI'm so happy that she enjoyed the show. I'm one proud Dad.\n\nIf you'll forgive me for quoting another famous British Rock band from the 60's, if you ask me about the next generation of Pink Floyd fandom, I'd say \"The Kids Are Alright\".",

I&amp;#39;ve learned that it&amp;#39;s near impossible to make both teenagers happy at the same time, so I was just hoping one would enjoy the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My son is big in to music, so I thought he&amp;#39;d enjoy it. But he&amp;#39;s not a night owl, and the concert running until 11pm on a school night put him in a bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my daughter, who had no interest in Pink Floyd, absolutely loved the show. She recently read 1984, and the Orwellian themes caught her attention. She immediately spotted a quote from 1984 used by Roger on one of the screens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days after the show, I heard her playing &amp;#39;Comfortably Numb&amp;#39; on the piano. She really liked the haunting version Roger used in the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so happy that she enjoyed the show. I&amp;#39;m one proud Dad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ll forgive me for quoting another famous British Rock band from the 60&amp;#39;s, if you ask me about the next generation of Pink Floyd fandom, I&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;The Kids Are Alright&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

When Virtual Reality first became a thing in the early 90's it was often shown on TV, and they'd always show the game \"Dactyl Nightmare\".  It was a low res, polygon, multiplayer game where players would shoot at pterodactyls.  I wanted to play that game so bad.\n\nIn the mid-90's, the \"Forte VFX1\" came out for home use.  I took all my savings and went out and bought it from the local computer store.   It worked with games like Quake, Descent, and Dark Forces, so I was super excited to immerse myself in those 3d worlds.  I really wanted to like that headset.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFX1\\_Headgear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFX1_Headgear)\n\nBut... the resolution of the Forte VFX1 was 263x230, with only 256 colors.  No matter how hard I tried to like it, I just couldn't.  The resolution was just too low.  The technology wasn't ready yet.  So I returned it to the store.\n\n25 years later, I have 2 kids now.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a child of the 80&amp;#39;s.  My first compute was an Apple IIe.  When Virtual Reality first became a thing in the early 90&amp;#39;s it was often shown on TV, and they&amp;#39;d always show the game &amp;quot;Dactyl Nightmare&amp;quot;.  It was a low res, polygon, multiplayer game where players would shoot at pterodactyls.  I wanted to play that game so bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the mid-90&amp;#39;s, the &amp;quot;Forte VFX1&amp;quot; came out for home use.  I took all my savings and went out and bought it from the local computer store.   It worked with games like Quake, Descent, and Dark Forces, so I was super excited to immerse myself in those 3d worlds.  I really wanted to like that headset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFX1_Headgear\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFX1_Headgear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... the resolution of the Forte VFX1 was 263x230, with only 256 colors.  No matter how hard I tried to like it, I just couldn&amp;#39;t.  The resolution was just too low.  The technology wasn&amp;#39;t ready yet.  So I returned it to the store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25 years later, I have 2 kids now.  They&amp;#39;re both gamers.  My oldest just turned 13 during this time of Covid isolation.

According to my uncle, he's been going down to his local grocery store at 6am to get food, but even at that time there are long lines and everything sells out before he can get anything.\n\nI know things are tough in that area right now, but I was wondering if this was localized to the grocery story he's trying (I doubt it).\n\nI've seen on the news that in some cities, various government groups or charities have tried to mobilize to get food to seniors who can't get out. Does anyone know if anything like this is available in Yonkers? I'd love to help him if I can.\n\nThanks all!\n\nEDIT: Thank You Everyone for all of the advice.  I think I have plenty to work with here, although additional suggestions are certainly welcome.  Special thanks to those offering to personally deliver food to them, but I'm reluctant to give the address of my elderly relatives to a stranger.  I'm sure you understand.  You're all wonderful people.  Stay safe everyone.  We'll all get through this.\n\nEDIT 2: You're all amazing!  I just got word from my Aunt that they were able to get food this morning.  They're all set.  It turns out, because of their age and limited mobility, they had been relying on a small corner grocer near their house, which had run out of product.  But they found another store equally as close which had plenty of food.  I compiled &amp; provided all of your suggestions for them, and offered to place food orders for them, but they say they are good.  They have a small apartment, with limited space, so they can't really stock up, otherwise I'd place a big Costco order for them.  I suggested the grocery delivery options (there are so many!), and hopefully I can convince them to join the 21st century and try ordering food online so they don't need to leave the apartment.  I've offered to place the order for them if they tell me what they need, but they insist they're good now.  I'll keep trying.  I'd prefer if they didn't go outside right now.  Thanks again to all of you for the help!  It's good to know there are kind people in New York willing to help those in need.  My heart is full today.  Stay safe everyone.",

It just seemed like a perfect query for AI.\n\nBased on the criteria from the Reddit post, I recommend:\nShe Kills Monsters: Young Adventurers Edition\nby Qui Nguyen\nHere's why it fits the criteria:\n * Length: The \"Young Adventurers Edition\" is specifically adapted to be concise, typically running around 75-90 minutes, fitting the \"90 minutes max\" requirement.\n * Genre/Tone: It's profoundly heart-wrenching as it deals with themes of grief, loss, and bullying, often bringing the audience to tears through its emotional depth. However, it ultimately has a happier, uplifting, and empowering ending about acceptance, identity, and carrying on a loved one's legacy.\n * Smaller Cast: While the original can have a larger cast, this edition is designed to be flexible and can be performed with a smaller ensemble, with actors often doubling roles.\n * Cast Composition (Majority Women, Equal Parts): The play prominently features strong female lead roles (Agnes, Tilly, Lilith, The Succubus) and offers multiple substantial parts for women, easily allowing for a majority female cast. The roles are well-developed, ensuring that characters beyond the leads have significant moments and contributions.\n * Cast Age (Primarily Teenagers): The central characters are high school students (Agnes and Tilly), making it perfectly suited for a cast primarily consisting of teenagers.\n * Content (Nothing too graphic): The \"Young Adventurers Edition\" was created specifically for high school and middle school productions. It removes mature language, sexual content, and tones down some of the more graphic violence from the original play, while still retaining its emotional impact and fantastical elements.\n * Overall Impact (Impressive): \"She Kills Monsters\" is a highly popular and well-regarded contemporary play. It's imaginative, theatrical, and addresses relevant themes in a unique and engaging way, making for a truly impressive production.",

It just seemed like a perfect query for AI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the criteria from the Reddit post, I recommend:\nShe Kills Monsters: Young Adventurers Edition\nby Qui Nguyen\nHere&amp;#39;s why it fits the criteria:\n * Length: The &amp;quot;Young Adventurers Edition&amp;quot; is specifically adapted to be concise, typically running around 75-90 minutes, fitting the &amp;quot;90 minutes max&amp;quot; requirement.\n * Genre/Tone: It&amp;#39;s profoundly heart-wrenching as it deals with themes of grief, loss, and bullying, often bringing the audience to tears through its emotional depth. However, it ultimately has a happier, uplifting, and empowering ending about acceptance, identity, and carrying on a loved one&amp;#39;s legacy.\n * Smaller Cast: While the original can have a larger cast, this edition is designed to be flexible and can be performed with a smaller ensemble, with actors often doubling roles.\n * Cast Composition (Majority Women, Equal Parts): The play prominently features strong female lead roles (Agnes, Tilly, Lilith, The Succubus) and offers multiple substantial parts for women, easily allowing for a majority female cast. The roles are well-developed, ensuring that characters beyond the leads have significant moments and contributions.\n * Cast Age (Primarily Teenagers): The central characters are high school students (Agnes and Tilly), making it perfectly suited for a cast primarily consisting of teenagers.\n * Content (Nothing too graphic): The &amp;quot;Young Adventurers Edition&amp;quot; was created specifically for high school and middle school productions. It removes mature language, sexual content, and tones down some of the more graphic violence from the original play, while still retaining its emotional impact and fantastical elements.\n * Overall Impact (Impressive): &amp;quot;She Kills Monsters&amp;quot; is a highly popular and well-regarded contemporary play. It&amp;#39;s imaginative, theatrical, and addresses relevant themes in a unique and engaging way, making for a truly impressive production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
