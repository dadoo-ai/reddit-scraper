Everyone else sitting at 60k for DPS and someone says \"Nice HP RDM\" to which he promptly replies \"Thanks.\" He's wearing full 260 gear. He's 80 BTW so he should know better. He proceeds to nearly die from every mechanic because I wasn't going to waste any single targeting heals on him. So as you can expect, his DPS was shit because he was spamming Vercure to stay alive. Never raised him but the SCH did. He died 3 times. When we wiped on the first pull, my friend with me tried to vote kick him, but it got rejected. So five other people were willing to carry this fuck.",

Everyone else sitting at 60k for DPS and someone says &amp;quot;Nice HP RDM&amp;quot; to which he promptly replies &amp;quot;Thanks.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s wearing full 260 gear. He&amp;#39;s 80 BTW so he should know better. He proceeds to nearly die from every mechanic because I wasn&amp;#39;t going to waste any single targeting heals on him. So as you can expect, his DPS was shit because he was spamming Vercure to stay alive. Never raised him but the SCH did. He died 3 times. When we wiped on the first pull, my friend with me tried to vote kick him, but it got rejected. So five other people were willing to carry this fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
