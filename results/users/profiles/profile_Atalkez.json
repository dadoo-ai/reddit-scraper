    "body": " \n\nHi all,\n\nDon't post too often, but looking for any other advice that I haven't found after hours and hours of google searches. I just replaced my CPU and GPU, and got a new CPU cooler (Christmas gift to myself, let's get it) in my rig. Temps are great, FPS is great, but I just can't get the random stuttering to stop. I've changed the settings in that .players text file to use all 8 cores, changed my graphics from highest to lowest and every setting change (spot cache ultra, etc), running out of ideas.\n\nMobo: B365-Plus Tuf Gaming\n\nGPU: PNY GeForce RTX 3070 XLR8 Revel Epic-X RGB\n\nCPU: Intel i9-9900K 3.6ghz-5.0ghz (I get 4.7 turbo generally)\n\nCPU cooler: Noctua NH-D15SPSU: Gigabyte P650B (650w bronze 80 plus)\n\nRAM: DDR4 Team Group Inc 8gb 2666 MHz x 4 (32gb)\n\nI was getting 82-85 cpu temps right after install. I used the Noctua thermal paste that came with the cooler, and ran the PC to get some burn time in. I also adjusted the case a bit. I have two intake fans at the front of the case, one exhaust at the back. I opened up the front and top windows for more airflow, which pulled the temps down a bunch, so I think that was the right call. Lots of air was getting trapped in the top of the case with the new cooler, and now that I opened it, case is never warm to the touch.\n\nUsing HWMonitor while idle my CPU temps run around 35-40c, and while running cod I'm pushing around 70c. GPU temps also 35-40 while idle, settling around 60c while in game. On Extreme settings, I generally hover around 120 fps, which is great, but just the stuttering every so often is causing me issues. I haven't noticed this nearly as much in other games, so starting to think this is just how mw2 is going to run. I'm not maxxing out my system to run the game, it feels like, but the stuttering just keeps happening. Attaching a HWMonitor of idle, and one in game.\n\nCould it be the RAM speed? With the better GPU and CPU, is 2666 hurting me there? To upgrade the RAM speed, I'll have to upgrade the mobo, which sucks.\n\nThanks for any tips you can offer!",
