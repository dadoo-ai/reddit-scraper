    "body": "Totally understand the issues with the costs. The venues we use generally have a minimum cost of 1.5k -2k but we end up spending closer to 4k on the venue alone. So if you held seminars at a library or college, you wouldn't have this spend. If your venue is at a library vs high end restaurant, you'll attract slightly different people at each, which is a good thing in my opinion. \n\nFor a smaller firm, I'd try webinars first and then scale up to educational workshops then higher end seminars. Webinars would be a great start. If you want to keep it as cheap as possible, I'd target your current lead base and LinkedIn connections first. If you don't have enough people to invite between those two, I'd then look into purchasing a mailing list that also provides email addresses of people as well as some Facebook Ads. The mailing lists can be filtered on whatever you're looking for such as specific age ranges, ZIP codes, Net worth (Investable assets is a tricky one), etc. \n\nIf you go the webinar route, I highly recommend having a follow-up series built out. Your attendance rate won't be as high as a seminar so make sure you have a plan on how to reconnect, send recordings of the webinar, or other material from your firm to these people. \n\nWe consistently bring in $2m-$4m in new AUM per seminar. We are doing 25 seminars this year.",

We define the amount of mailers we want to send - depends on our locations as hotter markets need less physical mailers - then AcquireUp handles the mailers. They have a nice platform for managing registrants as well. Facebook ads have been more cost effective for us but we see more unqualified people come from this route as compared to mailers. This is mainly due to a change Meta implemented earlier in the year where they force you to use their AI to create a target audience instead of you having the ability to upload a list of individuals. \n\nOur seminars are 8k-14k per 2 night event. We usually have 20-26 households attend each night, 50-65% schedule a meeting, and we bring on 2-5 new households per event. These events are at higher end restaurants or golf courses where we provide a meal to each person. Our asset minimum is $1m.\n\nWe started webinars this year and use Demio as a platform and content is presented by one of our CFPs. Majority of the traction we have is through Facebook and LinkedIn. Pretty low cost for the amount of leads but only 40-60% are qualified in our experience. We end up spending around $30-$50 per household lead.  \n  \nFor your scenario, it might be worth looking into more of an educational workshop that you host at a library. People love food so something like Crumbl cookie would be affordable. Libraries usually only charge a couple hundred to rent out a room. With webinars, we've had luck with very timely content. People that join from LinkedIn have a slightly higher attendance rate than Facebook.",
