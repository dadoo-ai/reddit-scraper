I didn’t lie at all on my resume, I can build damn near anything I want, I routinely pick up new tools/languages and create cool things with them.  I hopped on leetcode today to do some simple array problems in C++, and I can’t do it. I don’t mean it’s hard. I mean I genuinely don’t know where to begin. 1/2 the time I get a solution in my head, start to implement it, then code myself into a corner. So I’ll paste my code into Gemini and ask it to tell me where I went wrong and the solution it gives is so simple and elegant, I feel ashamed. When I DO manage to solve a problem, it doesn’t build off of what I learned, it’s all new. I can struggle with a problem for 45 mins, have an “aha” moment, solve it. Then I go to the next question and it’s the EXACT same thing. All the leetcode I did in the past, doesnt help. I’ve literally forgotten everything I used to know. \n\n1 year ago, I was decent at leetcode but I couldn’t build ANYTHING. Now I can build anything, but I can’t merge 2 sorted arrays. It’s all my fault too, I’m just a bad engineer, I have an opportunity and I’m going to fuck it up.\n\nI have 5 days left to study, and it’s overwhelming. If I do not get this job, I am going to give up. I am going to take a safe job at the grocery store and just accept a mid-tier life, pay off the loans I took for this SWE degree, and honestly forget about this dream.\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the support, I was really crashing out but yall have some good resources. I gotta redirect the energy into something better than laying on the floor thinking of the most optimal way to die.\n\nBTW: I have done “the leetcode grind” in the past, I’m not completely new to it at all. The past year, I’ve been so focused on my resume, applications, side projects, etc. I have been coding, just not prompt coding. I was just shocked at how LITTLE knowledge I retained even though I haven’t stoped coding as a whole",

So I’ll paste my code into Gemini and ask it to tell me where I went wrong and the solution it gives is so simple and elegant, I feel ashamed. When I DO manage to solve a problem, it doesn’t build off of what I learned, it’s all new. I can struggle with a problem for 45 mins, have an “aha” moment, solve it. Then I go to the next question and it’s the EXACT same thing. All the leetcode I did in the past, doesnt help. I’ve literally forgotten everything I used to know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 year ago, I was decent at leetcode but I couldn’t build ANYTHING. Now I can build anything, but I can’t merge 2 sorted arrays. It’s all my fault too, I’m just a bad engineer, I have an opportunity and I’m going to fuck it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 5 days left to study, and it’s overwhelming. If I do not get this job, I am going to give up. I am going to take a safe job at the grocery store and just accept a mid-tier life, pay off the loans I took for this SWE degree, and honestly forget about this dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: thanks for all the support, I was really crashing out but yall have some good resources. I gotta redirect the energy into something better than laying on the floor thinking of the most optimal way to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTW: I have done “the leetcode grind” in the past, I’m not completely new to it at all. The past year, I’ve been so focused on my resume, applications, side projects, etc. I have been coding, just not prompt coding. I was just shocked at how LITTLE knowledge I retained even though I haven’t stoped coding as a whole&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
