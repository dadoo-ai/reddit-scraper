Having tried frying, roasting baking and sous vide/pan fry in the past, I’ve decided to sous vide and pan fry finish again as it’s been the best results for me. I’m going to try the serious eats version of “Turchetta”. From my experience it seems like a solid and reliable method. I’m looking for opinions tho on a few challenges. I’m involuntarily involved in a lot of things for this event and getting a bit stretched thin. So I’m thinking, I have a 18lb turkey and 7lb breast with bone and skin. I’m doing 2 Turchetta's and going to sous vide the dark meat pieces and pan fry to finish as I’ve done in the past. My plan is to prep, season, vacuum seal the turkey (Tuesday) sous vide in batches Wednesday, refrigerate overnight.  Then on Thursday let the meat sit out at room temperature for an hour or two, pan sear and serve.\n\nTurkey is usually better next day anyway if you can retain its moisture. So will leave in the vacuum sealed bag overnight after the sous vide bath. Pan searing to crisp the skin should warm the meat enough without over cooking but still crisping skin to serve day of.\n\nThis way I can still do the potatos, gravy and tiramisu. Feeding 20 adults and 7 children. Planning on a medium bodied Pinot noir and a couple fingers of rye on ice.  Maybe a cigar with the family. I have a nice Williams Selyem that’s at its prime I’ll discreetly open to start. :)\n\nThoughts?",

I've known for some time that she's been a bit sexually curious about very specific women. There was a female bartender at our hotel she thought was cute. We left to continue our trip for another 9 days to another country. On the last night of the trip while at dinner, I used her phone to take a picture which is when I just happened to see endless instagram messages.\n\nAfterwards, she confessed to a lot of things. The sexual conversations, dirty pics, plans for this person to come to the US so they could go on \"dates\" etc. It was soul crushing. I've been pouring all of my effort in to our relationship, lives and financial future for 14 years. After an awful trip back to the US we immediately found a therapist. After two weeks of her watching the horrific pain she's caused me, watching me become completely dismantled, I find out that she is still continuing the affair with this girl.\n\nShe always had her moments of being distant over the years, particularly when we were having tough times in our relationship. But just like many of us, I love her more than anything and I miss my best friend. I don't know if we'll ever be able to fix this. She's sort of \"doing the work\" but her 35% of effort is just not enough. I don't want this relationship to end and I don't want to lose my best friend. I'm terrified about what my life will be like if I leave. I can't sleep, usually don't have an appetite and every day I wake up to a wave of emotions and realization of what is now my life.

If you really know it but just not good at taking the test, find the answers online and make a cheat sheet. Study that. Real world hands on experience is more important so don’t let a stupid test stand in your way. Just make sure you actually know your shit still. It will show otherwise, very quickly.",
