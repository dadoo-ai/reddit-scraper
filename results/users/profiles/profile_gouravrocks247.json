    "body": "Hey folks,\n\nI’ve been working as a Salesforce Tech Lead and recently started preparing for interviews to explore new opportunities. What I didn’t expect was how hard it would be to stay consistent with prep while managing a full-time job.\n\n# Some of the challenges I ran into:\n\n* Not knowing where to begin or which topics to prioritize\n* Struggling to stay focused after work hours\n* Wanting to go beyond Trailhead and get more hands-on practice\n* Keeping up with the latest Salesforce features and best practices\n\nSo instead of jumping randomly between resources, I decided to follow a more structured approach using **ChatGPT**. Here’s what I did:\n\n1. **Identified key areas** I wanted to focus on—Apex, LWC, Flows, Security, Data Modeling, etc.\n2. **Uploaded a few blog articles or docs** on each topic and asked ChatGPT to quiz me on them.\n3. For each question, I tried to answer it myself, then asked ChatGPT to explain the correct answer and the reasoning behind it.\n4. I repeated this across topics, and it helped me retain concepts better and spot my weak areas.\n5. I also used it to generate small code snippets or scenarios to practice hands-on.\n\nThis framework helped me stay consistent and made the prep feel more interactive and less overwhelming.\n\n# Here is the Prompt I used:\n\nPlay the role of a Salesforce Tech Lead who is interviewing me on &lt;TOPIC - Flow, Apex etc &gt;. I want you to go through the attached blog articles and then ask me a series of questions one by one starting from easy to difficult. I will answer each questions one by one and you will respond with the right answer, also give relevant link to blog article/ salesforce document in case i want to read more about it. After each answer ask me another questions. At the end give me a score and identify areas where i am strong and weak and need more focus.\n\nI’m curious—how do you all prepare for Salesforce interviews? Do you follow a structure or just go with the flow?\n\nAlso, I’ve been working on a tool based on this framework—something that combines interactive questions (MCQ, Drag &amp; Drop, Code Completion etc), AI summary explanations of answers, deep learning with link to top blog articles on the question and performance tracking/ prep plan. \n\nYou can register here for early access - [https://preview--smartforce-interview-ready.lovable.app/](https://preview--smartforce-interview-ready.lovable.app/)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and prep strategies!",

Posts with graphics get more attention.\n3. Engage with posts from other people, who have better engagement and reach than yours, you can give an input on their existing post and give your take or link to your post about same content. This will drive people to check your posts and eventually get eyeballs.\n\n# TO GET MORE ENGAGEMENTS\n\n4. THIS IS THE BIG ONE: Join relevant groups and publish your post in all of these Groups. I see better engagements when i post in a group and eventually people follow me.\n\n# TO GET MORE FOLLOWERS\n\n5. Send connection requests to other influencers/ target user group with a personalised note. Appreciating their recent posts or take on a topic. Better engage with their posts before sending a request. Make it organic. Eventually they will also follow you.\n\nYou need to spend time and effort on this and be consistent.

What I didn’t expect was how hard it would be to stay consistent with prep while managing a full-time job.\n\n# Some of the challenges I ran into:\n\n* Not knowing where to begin or which topics to prioritize\n* Struggling to stay focused after work hours\n* Wanting to go beyond Trailhead and get more hands-on practice\n* Keeping up with the latest Salesforce features and best practices\n\nSo instead of jumping randomly between resources, I decided to follow a more structured approach using **ChatGPT**. Here’s what I did:\n\n1. **Identified key areas** I wanted to focus on—Apex, LWC, Flows, Security, Data Modeling, etc.\n2. **Uploaded a few blog articles or docs** on each topic and asked ChatGPT to quiz me on them.\n3. For each question, I tried to answer it myself, then asked ChatGPT to explain the correct answer and the reasoning behind it.\n4. I repeated this across topics, and it helped me retain concepts better and spot my weak areas.\n5. I also used it to generate small code snippets or scenarios to practice hands-on.\n\nThis framework helped me stay consistent and made the prep feel more interactive and less overwhelming.\n\n# Here is the Prompt I used:\n\nPlay the role of a Salesforce Tech Lead who is interviewing me on &lt;TOPIC - Flow, Apex etc &gt;. I want you to go through the attached blog articles and then ask me a series of questions one by one starting from easy to difficult. I will answer each questions one by one and you will respond with the right answer, also give relevant link to blog article/ salesforce document in case i want to read more about it. After each answer ask me another questions. At the end give me a score and identify areas where i am strong and weak and need more focus.\n\nI’m curious—how do you all prepare for Salesforce interviews? Do you follow a structure or just go with the flow?\n\nAlso, I’ve been working on a tool based on this framework—something that combines interactive questions (MCQ, Drag &amp; Drop, Code Completion etc), AI summary explanations of answers, deep learning with link to top blog articles on the question and performance tracking/ prep plan. \n\nYou can register here for early access - [https://preview--smartforce-interview-ready.lovable.app/](https://preview--smartforce-interview-ready.lovable.app/)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and prep strategies!",

    "parsedCommunityName": "LinkedInTips",
    "body": "I wanted to share something exciting with you all—over the past 60 days, I’ve managed to achieve **48,000 impressions** on LinkedIn.\n\nThis might not seem like a lot compared to viral influencers, but for someone like me who has just started posting on Linkedin it was quiet motivating.\n\nHere's the simple process I followed to make it happen:\n\n# 1. Posting Consistently\n\nI committed to posting at least **2 times a week**, focusing on high-value content for my target audience.\n\n* I am a Salesforce developer and have a blog on the same topic.\n* I started posting about some of the most viewed blog posts on my website as well as others.\n* You can start with any niche and search some of the most searched topics around that niche. (Use semrush, google keyword planner)\n\n# 2. Engaging on Linkedin before publishing the post\n\nBefore publishing a post on Linkedin I made it a practice to engage with posts around my niche (Salesforce topics) and add my piece of mine on few of them.\n\n# 3. Publish your Post\n\nAfter engaging with a few posts I publish my content in a graphic Carousel format, which includes images, examples, explanations etc. Using a tool I created that makes the process fast and easy, no graphics designing experience is required.\n\nGraphics have a higher engagement rate than text posts.\n\nI never use a third-party scheduler app to schedule my posts in advance, as this can negatively impact your impressions. Read official **Automated activity on Linkedin** guide to know more about it. But I have utilized Linkedin schedulers for posting on my pages.\n\nI also publish the carousel on Linkedin groups around the same niche, this is what fetched me the most followers and engagements.\n\n# 4. Engage after your Post\n\nI make sure to comment on my post. This can be a bonus tip around the topic you are discussing or a CTA.\n\nI also engage in posts created by other influencers.\n\nThe overall process takes me around 30-45 mins.\n\n* Engage before post - 15min\n* Create carousel post - 5mins\n* Engage after post-15 mins\n\n# FREE Tools I used in the Process\n\nSemrush - (FREE) To search for topics which are most searched with KD between 0-30\n\n[PostBold.com](http://PostBold.com) \\- (FREE) To create carousels. Summarize the Blog content with ChatGPT in a JSON format and paste it into the tool.\n\nIn my observation, Linkedin respects your engagement with the platform and rewards you with impressions. It's all about being consistent, providing value, and standing out visually. Using tools like PostBold can accelerate things for you.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts!

Posts with graphics get more attention.\n3.

Send connection requests to other influencers/ target user group with a personalised note. Appreciating their recent posts or take on a topic. Better engage with their posts before sending a request.

The good news is, you can absolutely succeed by building something new in an existing market. But it takes the right strategy.\n\nHere's a guide on the dos and don'ts for SaaS founders entering competitive spaces:\n\n# Identify Unmet Needs\n\n**DO:** Conduct thorough market research to pinpoint pain points in current solutions. What are users complaining about? What features are missing? User interviews, review analysis, and community engagement can provide valuable insights.\n\n**DON'T:** Assume you know what customers want without validating your ideas. Take the time to deeply understand the market before building.\n\n# Carve Out a Niche\n\n**DO:** Focus on specific user segments or use cases that are underserved. Can you tailor your product for a particular industry? Specialization can be a powerful differentiator.\n\n**DON'T:** Try to be everything to everyone. Competing head-to-head with market leaders is an uphill battle.\n\n# Optimize the Experience\n\n**DO:** Prioritise an intuitive, fast, and enjoyable user experience. Great UX can set you apart even if core functionality is similar.\n\n**DON'T:** Underestimate the importance of design and usability. Users will flock to the most pleasant-to-use solution.\n\n# Innovate the Business Model\n\n**DO:** Consider unique pricing structures or distribution strategies. Can you offer a freemium version? Partner with complementary services? Creative go-to-market can be a key differentiator.\n\n**DON'T:** Assume you have to match the status quo. Disruptive thinking is often the path to success.\n\n# Stay Agile &amp; Adaptable\n\n**DO:** Remain flexible and responsive to market changes. What works today may not work tomorrow, so be ready to quickly pivot as needed.\n\n**DON'T:** Cling to your original vision if the data points in a different direction. SaaS is all about continuous improvement.\n\nThe bottom line is that entering an existing market is absolutely viable for SaaS founders. With the right strategy and execution, you can carve out a successful niche for your business.\n\nWhat other tips would you add for founders in this position? I'm excited to hear your insights!",

The background should be a city crossing with a display led ad board covering the corner of a building with a text places inside the board, here is the text 'Solution Architecture = Clear Requirements + Thoughtful Design + Continuous Collaboration.' in bold, professional font at the center.

Below it, add the text &amp;#39;READ THE POST&amp;#39; in a smaller, elegant font. The layout should be fully optimized to fit LinkedIn’s cover photo dimensions, with the text clear, legible, and well-spaced to ensure a polished, corporate appearance.&amp;quot; This prompt should guide the creation of a LinkedIn cover photo that aligns with professional standards.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if this was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "As a SaaS founder, you may be wondering if it's worth creating a product in a space with established players. The good news is, you can absolutely succeed by building something new in an existing market. But it takes the right strategy.\n\nHere's a guide on the dos and don'ts for SaaS founders entering competitive spaces:\n\n# Identify Unmet Needs\n\n**DO:** Conduct thorough market research to pinpoint pain points in current solutions. What are users complaining about? What features are missing? User interviews, review analysis, and community engagement can provide valuable insights.\n\n**DON'T:** Assume you know what customers want without validating your ideas. Take the time to deeply understand the market before building.\n\n# Carve Out a Niche\n\n**DO:** Focus on specific user segments or use cases that are underserved. Can you tailor your product for a particular industry? Specialization can be a powerful differentiator.\n\n**DON'T:** Try to be everything to everyone. Competing head-to-head with market leaders is an uphill battle.\n\n# Optimize the Experience\n\n**DO:** Prioritise an intuitive, fast, and enjoyable user experience. Great UX can set you apart even if core functionality is similar.\n\n**DON'T:** Underestimate the importance of design and usability. Users will flock to the most pleasant-to-use solution.\n\n# Innovate the Business Model\n\n**DO:** Consider unique pricing structures or distribution strategies. Can you offer a freemium version? Partner with complementary services? Creative go-to-market can be a key differentiator.\n\n**DON'T:** Assume you have to match the status quo. Disruptive thinking is often the path to success.\n\n# Stay Agile &amp; Adaptable\n\n**DO:** Remain flexible and responsive to market changes. What works today may not work tomorrow, so be ready to quickly pivot as needed.\n\n**DON'T:** Cling to your original vision if the data points in a different direction. SaaS is all about continuous improvement.\n\nThe bottom line is that entering an existing market is absolutely viable for SaaS founders. With the right strategy and execution, you can carve out a successful niche for your business.\n\nWhat other tips would you add for founders in this position? I'm excited to hear your insights!",

With a full-time job and a family to take care of, he could only spare a few hours a day to work on his side project. \n\nDespite these constraints and zero coding experience, David went on to create an AI app valued at over $1 million.\n\n# The Beginning\n\nMeet David Bressler, the brilliant mind behind Excel Formula Bot. The journey started modestly with a simple idea: an AI tool to convert text into Excel formulas. \n\nAt his office, David was constantly bombarded with questions about Excel formulas. \n\nHe recognized this as a widespread problem and saw an opportunity. Turning to ChatGPT for advice, he asked for a name for his tool, and \"Excel Formula Bot\" was born.\n\n# The Challenge\n\nDavid had no prior experience writing code. Determined to bring his idea to life, he immersed himself in research and discovered the world of no-code tools, landing on Bubble.io. \n\nHe spent countless hours learning and experimenting with Bubble, guided by YouTube tutorials.

How/ Why to use Semrush**\n\nUsing Semrush you can search for topics under a niche that people are searching for and there is less competition which makes is easier to rank higher in the google search.\n\n**For Example:** If you want to write about digital marketing. Goto Semrush and enter Digital Marketing in the top Enter URL/ Domain section. This will give you an exhaustive list of keywords people are actually searching with volume, KD and other parameters.\n\n**2. Why bother about KD**\n\nNow it's difficult to compete with high authority websites like investopedia, mailchimp etc who are writing about the same topic. We need to find  keywords which are less competitive and have good volume (for starters it can be 100+ volumes)\n\nWe will then put a filter on semrush to show us the keywords with KD between 0 - 30. This will give us a shorter list to focus on.\n\nAs i am writing this comment, i did a filter on the KD and one of the keyword we can write about - **is digital marketing legit** with monthly search volume of **1900** and **KD of 29.**\n\nHope i was able to clarify your doubts. Try out these steps and you will get a better clarity once you explore these steps. You can also use Keyword Planner by Google (FREE)\n\nDo let me know if you need any more insights.",
