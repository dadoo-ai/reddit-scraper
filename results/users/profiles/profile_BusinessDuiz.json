All of this improved with adoption and feedback.\n\nAnother example is chipsets. They are remarkably faster than they've ever been, but that's only because the semiconductors were iteratively improved over time. Nvidias first chipset was fabricated using a 40-nanometer process. Current chipsets use 5-nanometer process. The equipment used in the 5nm process was possible because of the processing power of the previously fabricated chipsets.\n\nAgentic AI is the dream that science fiction writers have had since its inception. The ability to command technology to our will and see it perform accordingly and with its own agency.  \n\nI may be wrapped in my own hopefulness, but I believe that innovation requires iteration and that this technology requires an unbelievable amount of scale to achieve, It's hard for me to say that customers are being pushed a half-baked product because of capitalism. \n\nRather, I tend towards the idea that we are at the front end of this innovation and if we want the future we must also accept the present.",
