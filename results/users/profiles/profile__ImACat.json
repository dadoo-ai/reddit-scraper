Which makes them feel like I only love that part of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just feel so stuck - one minute I think “I’m failing both of us because I’m trying to handle this and can’t” and the next minute I think “I love this person more than anything else and don’t ever want to be with anyone else.”  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling extra anxious because we are visiting my hometown and I’m scared to run into someone I know from high school and introduce “my partner &amp;lt;girl name&amp;gt;” instead of “my husband &amp;lt;birth name&amp;gt;.” And I feel like an asshole for that. But it’s how I feel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to navigate this transition seems like a vicious cycle. Like a hole that every time I try to dig myself out of I only fall deeper into. Like I’m trying to reconcile something that can’t be reconciled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are both in therapy; I like my therapist well enough but am thinking I might need to find a new one who will push me a little bit more. Idk. Like the title of this post suggests - I’m just kind of feeling my feels into the internet. Thanks for sticking with this post if you’ve made it this far. Hope that you know you’re not alone if you are just fumbling through a similar situation day-by-day like we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
