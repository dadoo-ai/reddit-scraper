    "body": "**Issue**\n\nI recently went and completely redid my home internet setup with TP-Link Omada gear, pay for 1GB fiber up and down, but over WiFi never see more than 500Mbps. I had my ISP come out and with their wireless AP, I got OVER 1GB.  On a wired connection, I'm able to get pretty close to the stated 1GB.  I'm suspecting an issue with how the APs are configured.  I've used the WiFi Optimization multiple times.\n\n**My Setup**\n\nI have an Omada Cloud Controller, SG2210MP POE switch, ER605 Router, 4 EAP615-Wall APs.  My house has a basement, main floor, and an upstairs (about 4000 sqft).  I have one EAP615 in the basement (hardwired), two on the main floor (both hardwired), and one upstairs (hardwired).  Mesh is completely turned off.\n\nI'm using both 2.4GHz and 5GHz on all APs.  The Channel Width seems to be auto set to 80MHz on all APs.  The channels and Tx Power were auto set by the WiFi Optimizer--all seemed to be set to Tx Power of \"High\" and all on different channels.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xrmd1wm83se1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96fa77cd22d28c5ab7b1dfc55ee0ad4313609b69",
