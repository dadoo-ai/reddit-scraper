I got so far Aero M4e1 lower and threaded upper, odinworks cqb rifle stock/buffer, milspec giesellle trigger (this will be my HDW), SOLWG lower parts kit, toolcraft dlc bcg. Im in tax stamp hell waiting for my Full Nelson Silencer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So im torn between getting the KAK 5r1-5t  5.5 barrel in 416r or the Mos-tek  5r1-5t  5.5 barrel in 4150.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If i go with the Mos-tek then ill on their website state i need a side control ABG (because of the shortbarrel) but i cant find any. Any suggestions would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im also going for an integrated sub look, but cant find any handguards with the inner 1.8 diameter fit the full nelson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I’m suggesting this approach because it does seem this person has the ears of your boss. Let him know hey I’m asking you direct question and all your are providing is vague or ignoring my question  or undermining you as it relates to the project. Provide actionable items (for you and that person) to address the concerns in an follow up email after this meeting.\n\nIf the above does not work, for what ever reason, now you have documentation to show the risk and mitigations attempted to prevent the issues at hand. This is your CYA to show you are not the abrasive person on the project .

    "body": "I’ve been in the Sales ops space for over a decade. I’m a consultant now. Things I wished I knew earlier were the following :\n\n1. Think of your job as sales facilitator. You have requirements from finance and biz ops but at the end of the day want you to facilitate closing deals and not be seen as an encumbrance to the deal. If you don’t know already, Develop a deep knowledge of the sale cycle at your company. This will help you in the long term as intermediary for the finance , marketing, and product management dept. \n\n2. Learn the office politics. This is key for being promoted, being included in on big decisions that may directly/indirectly impact your department(budgets, headcount, office space, etc.). The c level operates much differently, contributions are important but always under the lens of politics. \n\n3.  Finish your degree. I didn’t and still don’t have one. I was able to progress because I was always willing to learn new things that directly and indirectly affected my job. It seams you do to. However this will only get you so far. If I could finish my degree now it would in Data analytics . MBA are a dime a dozen. It seems you have the aptitude to go this route and not to mentions it provides ample an opportunities elsewhere where(recession proof). If you can get PMP cert, and certs in what ever Crm, and accounting software your company uses (in my case I have 6x salesforce certs, 12x hubspot certs, netsuite and pmp certs).\n\n4. If you don’t know something to someone’s question just respond “I’ll get back to you later with the answer”.  It’s ok not to know things but let if other know you don’t know does not provide for good optics. \n\n5. Some people would says the following is not a good strategy but IMHO, each workplace is different and politics impact the follow suggestion. Develop an SOP (repetitive tasks only) for your department and constantly look to improve upon. Here’s the controversial bit: do not give out your  knowledge to critical aspects of your job. The reason to for this is to protect your self in the event that the company decides they dont need you any more. If you create an SoP for everything then you are at that point you are easily replaceable. I learned this the hard way.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in the Sales ops space for over a decade. I’m a consultant now. Things I wished I knew earlier were the following :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of your job as sales facilitator. You have requirements from finance and biz ops but at the end of the day want you to facilitate closing deals and not be seen as an encumbrance to the deal. If you don’t know already, Develop a deep knowledge of the sale cycle at your company. This will help you in the long term as intermediary for the finance , marketing, and product management dept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn the office politics. This is key for being promoted, being included in on big decisions that may directly/indirectly impact your department(budgets, headcount, office space, etc.). The c level operates much differently, contributions are important but always under the lens of politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finish your degree. I didn’t and still don’t have one. I was able to progress because I was always willing to learn new things that directly and indirectly affected my job. It seams you do to. However this will only get you so far. If I could finish my degree now it would in Data analytics . MBA are a dime a dozen. It seems you have the aptitude to go this route and not to mentions it provides ample an opportunities elsewhere where(recession proof). If you can get PMP cert, and certs in what ever Crm, and accounting software your company uses (in my case I have 6x salesforce certs, 12x hubspot certs, netsuite and pmp certs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know something to someone’s question just respond “I’ll get back to you later with the answer”.  It’s ok not to know things but let if other know you don’t know does not provide for good optics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people would says the following is not a good strategy but IMHO, each workplace is different and politics impact the follow suggestion. Develop an SOP (repetitive tasks only) for your department and constantly look to improve upon. Here’s the controversial bit: do not give out your  knowledge to critical aspects of your job. The reason to for this is to protect your self in the event that the company decides they dont need you any more. If you create an SoP for everything then you are at that point you are easily replaceable. I learned this the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
