I am a new graduate out of college, so pardon me if this may be a silly question, but I've been trying to figure it out for days now.\n\nI am building a website for a small business, and everything looks great, other than this \"About Us\" section. I have tested the responsiveness across many devices through chrome with different dimensions and they all look like they should, based on the device. \n\nHowever, the owner of the business who I keep sending the website too, is the only one that is still having an outdated version of the website. I have asked all my friends to test it on their devices and it is showing the most recent changes when I upload the new files to Hostinger. \n\nThe customer who I am doing the website for isn't necessarily tech savvy, and I dont want to tell her to go into her safari settings and delete her cache, but I think that may be the problem here? Unless someone else has a solution as to why her phone isn't showing the updates. Now its showing the updated text, but I fixed the responsiveness for the About Us section so the text is aligned in the center with the white, but I am not sure why all these other devices have been working fine, but the person who is paying me, its not working for them! \n\nI am desperate for some help if anyone has a solution or something I can try. \n\n[This is how it's showing up on her iPhone. ](https://preview.redd.it/p27p54fkztac1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c3ea10a12bff6e4cdb70a4c0260b52fb9eaec00)",

Brandi especially coming after anyone that inconveniences her.\n\nEspecially when they all go to Palm Springs and Brandi is just SO RUDE to Joyce and no one else is seeing what’s wrong with calling her the wrong name minus Kyle and Kim. I’m screaming at my tv to tell them to YELL AT HER AND TELL HER OFF!! Yolanda is also just as ignorant when it comes to it all and so is Lisa trying to defend each other, and it just really feels like they’re all ganging up on Kyle.\n\n Kim is Kim and she’s there and she gets her words in but I’m also like relax girl it’s not that big of a deal what you’re upset over.\n\nAlso Carlton creeps me out and she also just makes me angry, idk what it is about her but she just angers me.\n\nAnyways I’m all over the place with the post as I’m angrily typing this. My friend told me Brandi gets better at the end of season 4 and is good during season 5 but DAMN, when she’s drunk I just wanna scream at her! I can’t stand the mean girl energy coming from Brandi, Yolanda, and Lisa! \n\nThis season was so long ago but when you watch it you feel it happened only last year!
