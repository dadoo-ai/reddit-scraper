    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get into to consulting the more certs the better. It depends on what the consultancy does as far as which certs matter more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For general purpose places Sales/Service/Experience certs are usually good. For one that specializes in Nonprofits, for example, the NP cert will mean more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Different certifications have different values/levels (see Link below). Partners want L2 or better. To get those you usually need Admin as a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://partners.salesforce.com/pdx/s/learn/article/partner-program-certifications-MCVDJGAAIH3REYJH2XQBDRCUPBNE?language=en_US\"&gt;https://partners.salesforce.com/pdx/s/learn/article/partner-program-certifications-MCVDJGAAIH3REYJH2XQBDRCUPBNE?language=en_US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck with whatever you decide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I go to AM and it is of course studio dependent, but there is no incentive for them to set you up for failure.
