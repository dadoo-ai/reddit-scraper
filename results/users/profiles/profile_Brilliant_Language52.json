Here is an example of a “home” &lt;a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/16208-Glynn-Rd-East-Cleveland-OH-44112/33648585_zpid/?utm_campaign=iosappmessage&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=txtshare\"&gt;purchased for over 2M&lt;/a&gt;. I’m guessing it’s multiple properties bundled into one purchase. Still this type of activity seems very unusual because there hasn’t been any real investment of development there for a multitude of reasons and most homes aren’t worth 50K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any idea of what’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
