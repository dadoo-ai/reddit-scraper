    "body": "Update: Comcast responded to my BBB and FCC complaints and **fully refunded the technician fee**. Corporate understood what no support rep could - that the issue couldn't be both customer equipment and a splitter problem; it had to be one or the other. The technician fee was not valid - just as I was saying all along. Additionally, it seems that support reps don't have the authority to remove the fee (even if you escalate it), so if you have a valid case, escalating through official complaints is the way to go (rather than within Comcast). If you do not have a valid case, do not escalate it - it's a waste of these resources. \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nETA: Adding this to inform others who are in a similar boat. After talking with support via Modmail, nothing can be done to remove the fee because it's a \"valid fee\". They told me:\n\n&gt;The reason you were charged for the visit is that the tech indicated there were \"customer equipment problems\". The replaced splitter is also noted as a resolution, but the visit chargeable because of that initial reason I mentioned. \n\nIn case you didn't know, the splitter is comcast-owned infrastructure, not a customer's responsibility. The splitter is noted by the technician as the resolution for my intermittent connection issues. Even though they can validate what I said about the splitter being the root issue, they cannot apply more than the $50 credit because the fee is \"valid\" since there is a note about \"customer equipment problems\". Well yeah, my equipment isn't going to work if there's a faulty splitter. The root cause was the splitter and anyone can see that is obvious, but an erroneous note about \"customer equipment problems\" is why I'm forced to pay a fee that I didn't consent to and wasn't made aware of even though that information is so obviously false.\n\nThis is an example of predatory and deceptive billing practices. I've reported them to the FCC and BBB and will continue escalating this. A multi-million dollar company shouldn't be able to take advantage of its customers like this.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI’ve been dealing with intermittent internet issues for the entire 3.5 years I’ve lived in my apartment. Two weeks ago, I called Comcast, and after the usual “reset your equipment” routine, they told me the next step was to send out a Comcast technician. I spoke to two different reps, and neither of them mentioned a technician fee.\n\nWhen the technician came out, he confirmed that the issue was an **exterior cable problem**, specifically something about a split cable. He assured me that he fixed it and even tested the signal strength before and after to confirm the fix worked. Comcast’s own policy states that they don’t charge for exterior issues, yet their system now falsely claims the problem was with my equipment - which is completely wrong.\n\nA few months ago, bought a **brand-new gateway (Netgear)** because Comcast kept blaming my equipment for the intermittent connection. When the technician was here for the appointment, nothing about my equipment was changed - same MAC ID on my gateway, same coaxial cable, etc. The technician didn’t touch my equipment, yet Comcast is insisting that my equipment is the reason for the $100 charge.\n\nAfter nearly **TWO HOURS** on hold, they told me the best they could do was credit my account for $50, citing that the technician notes say it was the customer's equipment, even though that's factually false. They also cannot tell me what specifically about my equipment was fixed (because it wasn't the issue). I shouldn't have been charged because it was an exterior cable issue from how the original technician setup and installed it back in 2021 (which they also charged me over $100 for at that time). This is their fault so they need to take accountability and fix it for free.\n\nNot only should they remove the charge entirely, but they should also be crediting me for all the weeks I’ve gone without a working internet connection over the last 3.5 years! I’m beyond frustrated with Comcast’s tactics and blatant disregard for their own policies. Does anyone know how to get this fee credited to my account?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppo5e1ryspre1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a673f8cbc6770e7929c34f1a1fee4cd32370acb",

    "body": "TLDR; As an AuDHD girlie, I highly suggest online proctoring! It's not nearly as bad as people have said.\n\nHey all! I have seen a few posts about online proctored vs on-site proctored SFDC exams and wanted to provide insight since the majority of posts + comments lean towards taking them on-site. I recently completed my second online proctored SFDC exam and it went just fine. I was nervous because they've changed the software since my last online proctored exam and redditors mentioned lots of issues with the new software. I read the instructions carefully and used an alternative computer since my main computer has so many windows and programs open that I didn't want to close. I also saw a comment that the software ruined someone's computer so I used a computer that I can live without, just in case (yes it's a privilege, but I had to get laid off to acquire a \"spare\" laptop, so it came with a price much greater than the cost of a laptop). \n\nI put a blanket over my TV since all other screens need to be covered (again, read the instructions provided by SFDC). They never asked me to show them my room. My back was close to a wall with a painting on it and it wasn't an issue. I took the test when it was pitch black outside. So, I setup the lighting by turning on ALL the lights and moving a lamp directly in front of me instead of to the side of me to remove any shadows on my face. This made the reflection on my glasses really bad so I decided to wear contacts. The computer was pretty close to my face so my eyes could be seen really well. \n\n**I wasn't stopped by the proctor at all during the exam.** There was even a point when I accidentally pulled on my computer's charger and my laptop swiveled so I was out of frame for a second. I was so nervous that would stop my exam, but it didn't. I was also touching my eyes a lot because my eyes HATE contacts and they're so dry this time of year, but it wasn't an issue because I kept my eyes on my screen. Hands on and touching my face was also not an issue, but I was cognizant to not cover my mouth or eyes. I also looked down at my hands while I was typing and it was fine. I had a glass of water next to me (not visible), but didn't need to drink it so I can't speak to that. My Alexa made a daily announcement during the exam and nothing happened (likely because I didn't allow it to interrupt me and I kept my eyes on my screen).\n\n**Tips for Online Proctor** \n\n* Keep your eyes on the screen!!!! (I did accidentally look away briefly a few times and it was fine)\n* Read the exam guidelines and registration closely - available on [Trailhead's website](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/help?article=Online-Proctoring-Completing-Your-Exam-Remotely)\n* Don't wear glasses if you can help it. (Last time I took an online exam, they did stop me to look at my glasses, but it wasn't a big deal. I was just an anxious ball of anxiety and decided to solve that by wearing contacts this time around). \n* If you struggle with not talking aloud or not reading the questions aloud (like me), use the notes panel during the test to write down what you want to say. I did slightly mouth the questions when reading them and it wasn't an issue (it wasn't an exaggerated mouthing though). Another thing that helped me with this was highlighting the questions with my mouse as I was reading them. I think this also made it easier for the proctor to see that my eyes were following my mouse. \n* Use additional lighting so your eyes can be seen really clearly\n* If you have long hair, have it tied back so you aren't distracted with it \n* Go to a secluded room where pets and children won't bother you (they'll be fine for less than 2 hours). \n* The notes panel is a new feature since my last exam. I found it helpful to document any questions I skipped or was unsure of by including their question number and topic. Some questions are answers for other questions. This saved me a lot of time when reviewing my exam at the end. \n* There is a survey after you finish your exam before you can see your test results. Just be aware of it. I find it super annoying and nerve wrecking when I'm frantically clicking to see if I passed! You can easily skip passed it, but it might be frustrating if you're not aware of it.\n* You won't be able to see the clock while you take the exam, but there is a timer that shows you the time left to complete the exam.\n\nOnline proctored exams will be the only ones I do from now on. They closed down the testing center closest to me so I have to travel quite for to get to a testing center anyhow. I also LOVE the luxury of being able to schedule it last minute. I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments! ",

    "body": "I received an alert about a \"major derogatory mark\" on my credit score on November 18th from Chase Credit Journey (sheer dumb luck I even opened the email or signed up for this stupid free thing. I get alerts monthly and usually ignore them). It turns out it's from a fee that went to collections from a leasing company that I've never heard of in a state I've never lived in nor visited. After carefully analyzing my credit reports from the bureaus, I noticed 4 inquiries from leasing offices earlier this year. With this information, I'm desperately trying to find if there is a lease in my name floating around out there. I've gotten in contact with 2/4 leasing companies who pulled inquiries on my credit, but the last 2 are difficult to crack because I only have the name of the rental research software said leasing companies used to run a credit check when the thief applied to these apartments. Due to this fraudulent collections fee, my credit score decreased by 85 points!!!!!!!! Additionally, if this isn't handled appropriately, it will remain on my credit report for SEVEN YEARS!!!!!!!!! And it isn't even mine!!!\n\n**My questions are:**\n\n1. How do I get to the bottom of whether or not there is a lease out there in my name? / Would this address appear on my credit reports now if it happened 5 months ago?\n2. How do I lock my SSN so no one can get a lease in my SSN?\n3. I changed my name in March 2023 and this person was able to apply for a lease in my PREVIOUS name in June 2023. How can I prevent any and all activity that comes through in my PREVIOUS name? Absolutely nothing should be allowed in my PREVIOUS name, including inquiries. It should be marked as a mismatch and flagged. Yes, I've updated my name E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E and protected the heck out of my new name by not sharing it (I still have friends who don't know my new name). I don't care if I lock my damn self out of ever opening an account or applying to an apartment. This needs to stop.\n4. Do I file a police report where this person attempted to use my identity or in the state I reside?\n5. Is there someone I can hire to resolve this for me? What kind of person would I contact to get assistance with this and guarantee it is eliminated from my credit history?\n\n**Actions taken thus far:**\n\n* Filed a dispute with the only credit bureau that shows the fraudulent collections fee.\n* Freeze at all 3 bureaus\n* Fraud alert at all 3 bureaus\n* Downloaded credit report from all 3 bureaus\n* Called the apartment company that sent the fee to collections\n* Called the leasing office of another company that pulled my credit when someone applied for an apartment in my SSN + name. I sent them a photo of my ID and she confirmed the person's ID had my information (the middle name was partially wrong) and their photo. The person I spoke to said based on this person's ID, they are not the same race as me. The leasing office isn't legally allowed to send me a copy of this ID which could really help me crack this case. They didn't approve the lease because the background check revealed that I was \"ON LEASE\" and they don't allow folks to have 2 leases.\n\n**Additional Background:**\n\n* I can't dispute the inquiries on my credit report because they are *soft* inquiries rather than hard inquiries (I couldn't select any soft inquiries when following the prompts for disputing.)\n* Someone attempted to take out unemployment in my SSN in December of 2021. Since they weren't successful, [identity.gov](https://identity.gov) led me to only freeze my credit and post a fraud alert at all bureaus so that's what I did. However, this is the *second time* my identity has been compromised and it's getting old.\n* I have not contacted the Collections agency because they are crooks, will twist your words to make it sound like you validated the debt when you didn't. They also refuse to put anything in writing and I NEED it in writing in order to clear it from my credit report. I've only heard TERRIBLE things about this company so I refuse to contact them. They also never sent me a letter to validate the debt. I didn't know anything until it was reported to the credit bureau.",

With this information, I&amp;#39;m desperately trying to find if there is a lease in my name floating around out there. I&amp;#39;ve gotten in contact with 2/4 leasing companies who pulled inquiries on my credit, but the last 2 are difficult to crack because I only have the name of the rental research software said leasing companies used to run a credit check when the thief applied to these apartments. Due to this fraudulent collections fee, my credit score decreased by 85 points!!!!!!!! Additionally, if this isn&amp;#39;t handled appropriately, it will remain on my credit report for SEVEN YEARS!!!!!!!!! And it isn&amp;#39;t even mine!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My questions are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do I get to the bottom of whether or not there is a lease out there in my name? / Would this address appear on my credit reports now if it happened 5 months ago?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do I lock my SSN so no one can get a lease in my SSN?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I changed my name in March 2023 and this person was able to apply for a lease in my PREVIOUS name in June 2023. How can I prevent any and all activity that comes through in my PREVIOUS name? Absolutely nothing should be allowed in my PREVIOUS name, including inquiries. It should be marked as a mismatch and flagged. Yes, I&amp;#39;ve updated my name E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E and protected the heck out of my new name by not sharing it (I still have friends who don&amp;#39;t know my new name). I don&amp;#39;t care if I lock my damn self out of ever opening an account or applying to an apartment. This needs to stop.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do I file a police report where this person attempted to use my identity or in the state I reside?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is there someone I can hire to resolve this for me? What kind of person would I contact to get assistance with this and guarantee it is eliminated from my credit history?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions taken thus far:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Filed a dispute with the only credit bureau that shows the fraudulent collections fee.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Freeze at all 3 bureaus&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fraud alert at all 3 bureaus&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Downloaded credit report from all 3 bureaus&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Called the apartment company that sent the fee to collections&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Called the leasing office of another company that pulled my credit when someone applied for an apartment in my SSN + name. I sent them a photo of my ID and she confirmed the person&amp;#39;s ID had my information (the middle name was partially wrong) and their photo. The person I spoke to said based on this person&amp;#39;s ID, they are not the same race as me. The leasing office isn&amp;#39;t legally allowed to send me a copy of this ID which could really help me crack this case. They didn&amp;#39;t approve the lease because the background check revealed that I was &amp;quot;ON LEASE&amp;quot; and they don&amp;#39;t allow folks to have 2 leases.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I can&amp;#39;t dispute the inquiries on my credit report because they are &lt;em&gt;soft&lt;/em&gt; inquiries rather than hard inquiries (I couldn&amp;#39;t select any soft inquiries when following the prompts for disputing.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Someone attempted to take out unemployment in my SSN in December of 2021. Since they weren&amp;#39;t successful, &lt;a href=\"https://identity.gov\"&gt;identity.gov&lt;/a&gt; led me to only freeze my credit and post a fraud alert at all bureaus so that&amp;#39;s what I did. However, this is the &lt;em&gt;second time&lt;/em&gt; my identity has been compromised and it&amp;#39;s getting old.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have not contacted the Collections agency because they are crooks, will twist your words to make it sound like you validated the debt when you didn&amp;#39;t. They also refuse to put anything in writing and I NEED it in writing in order to clear it from my credit report. I&amp;#39;ve only heard TERRIBLE things about this company so I refuse to contact them. They also never sent me a letter to validate the debt. I didn&amp;#39;t know anything until it was reported to the credit bureau.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "**\\*\\*\\*SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM!!!\\*\\*\\***\n\nI've been making my monthly student loan payments since 2020 and my student loan balance is now below $10k. If Biden's student loan forgiveness goes into effect, I believe I will get $10k (not $20k) and I was pretty much at exactly $10k owed as of March 2020.\n\nI called Nelnet (who my loans were transferred to in July 2022 from Fedloan) to get a refund for all payments made from March 2020-August 2022. Below details my experience.\n\nTime of call: 6:15pm CST\n\nLength of call: 14 mins\n\nHold time: 0 mins\n\nHave your Nelnet account number ready!\n\nWhen I called, I said I wanted a refund for my payments (I didn't need to mention the CARES act). The customer support rep knew exactly what I was referring to (I don't remember her name but I loved her). It also doesn't matter that Fedloan had my loans for years and Nelnet had them for 2 months. You need to call the student loan servicer that currently holds your loans for a refund. I was asked simple questions and given details I already knew (fully thanks to this sub reddit). Here's the information you'll need to provide:\n\n\\- Start date of payments (i.e. March 13, 2020)\n\n\\- Full amount you want refunded (I added up all of my payments from March 2020-August 2022, but I'm not sure you need to do that)\n\n\\- Verify contact information (i.e. address, phone, etc)\n\n**MISC Information:** When you call, it is for a refund for payments you already made towards your loan balance. Your loan balance will increase by the amount of your refund. It's important to have your loan balance at $10k-$20k before you apply for Biden's student loan forgiveness (the application will be available mid-late October). That's the whole point of asking for a refund.\n\nThe rep wasn't sure if I would be receiving my refund in the form of a check or directly into my account. She said that things have been changing daily and that originally they were telling people they'd receive checks. Now, she believes refunds will be issued in the same form of payment with which they were paid. She said I can call back in a few weeks to ask. That's more than okay with me.\n\n**Timing**: She said refunds will take 60-75 business days but they are the highest priority for them and are working to get them done as quickly as possible. Obviously they were swamped when the announcement was made so I anticipated it would take a long time to process my refund. All sounds great to me!\n\nI think waiting until after Labor day and calling in the evening worked out in my favor because they have more things figured out and most folks have likely already called for a refund. I'm not sure how long you have to get a refund but the refunds for payments are only March 2020-August 2022. You can definitely call them after August 31st for a refund (like I did). It seems like a lot of folks assumed the deadline is August 31, 2022, but it is not.\n\n**---------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE 10/25/22\\*\\*\\***\n\nYesterday, I received 2 checks for the 2 payments I made to Nelnet after my loan was transferred to them. My outstanding loan balance was updated with those 2 payments as well (a very small amount of money btw). However, the additional $3,500 was missing. I thought this was odd because these are the payments I made to Fedloan, before my loan was transferred to Nelnet.\n\nI called Nelnet and they said my full refund was approved on 10/12/22 and I should receive the checks and see my updated balance within 2-4 weeks. It's being processed by the Department of Treasury.\n\nI will update again once this happens!\n\nI do advise signing up for USPS Informed Delivery. I was SO confused when I saw I had 2 checks coming in the mail from the Department of Treasury. I'm also terrible at checking my mail so I knew to check my mail yesterday because I had seen it on USPS Informed Delivery.\n\n**---------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE 11/3/22\\*\\*\\***\n\nI called Nelnet again today and asked what amounts they have showing in their system for payments made to Fedloan. They didn't see a refund request for any payments I made to Fedloan. So, today I provided them the amount and they submitted the refund request to the department of education. This means that no action has been or ever was taken since September 6th and I just now found this out today. Trust that I have called them WEEKLY about my refunds and they just read me a script rather than giving me specific information pertaining to my account.\n\nAnyways they said I should see the amount updated on my loan in 12-14 days and the checks will be sent 60-75 days after that.\n\nI'm going to give them a second chance even though I am p i s s e d. If the amounts aren't updated in 3 weeks I'm filing a complaint with federal student aid.\n\nI did also call Fedloan for my payment history and they're mailing that to me which should arrive in 14 days. Nelnet didn't ask me for this documentation and I'm not sure if it will help my case, but I'll have it if I need to file a complaint.",

I was SO confused when I saw I had 2 checks coming in the mail from the Department of Treasury. I&amp;#39;m also terrible at checking my mail so I knew to check my mail yesterday because I had seen it on USPS Informed Delivery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***UPDATE 11/3/22**\\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called Nelnet again today and asked what amounts they have showing in their system for payments made to Fedloan. They didn&amp;#39;t see a refund request for any payments I made to Fedloan. So, today I provided them the amount and they submitted the refund request to the department of education. This means that no action has been or ever was taken since September 6th and I just now found this out today. Trust that I have called them WEEKLY about my refunds and they just read me a script rather than giving me specific information pertaining to my account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways they said I should see the amount updated on my loan in 12-14 days and the checks will be sent 60-75 days after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to give them a second chance even though I am p i s s e d. If the amounts aren&amp;#39;t updated in 3 weeks I&amp;#39;m filing a complaint with federal student aid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did also call Fedloan for my payment history and they&amp;#39;re mailing that to me which should arrive in 14 days. Nelnet didn&amp;#39;t ask me for this documentation and I&amp;#39;m not sure if it will help my case, but I&amp;#39;ll have it if I need to file a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
