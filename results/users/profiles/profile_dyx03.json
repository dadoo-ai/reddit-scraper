I have Death Pall as a permanent game condition, that works.\n\n2. I'd like to have prolonged times of darkness. Permanent sun blocker/eclipse leads to all plants dying, leading to an empty map and I'm forced to grow nutrifungus, so that's just boring. Eclipses in general don't last very long, and I don't want to trigger one every few days, as again that's a bit boring. VEE's long night is too long to be feasible. Right now, I've picked the \"Advanced Unnatural Darkness\" mod and the plan is to trigger that a couple times per year. Does anyone have any other suggestions that wouldn't involve Anomaly?\n\n3. I'd like to trigger refugee groups regularly. However, neither the scenario editor nor the mod \"Scheduled Events\" lets me pick that specific quest as an incident. :( Am I just missing it, or does anyone know of a way to do so? Otherwise I'd need to trigger it manually using dev mode, and I'd prefer not to.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.",
