For the past two straight weeks now I've been dealing with the gum area around some molars bleeding but it doesn't heal. I've been using CVS brand Orajel but saw that the directions say to no use more than 7 days straight. I don't know if this is Periodontal Disease, I had my routine cleaning 4 months ago and was fine, below are some pictures for context. If it's just a matter of clean your teeth better that's cool, but I still don't know why the area around my teeth won't heal, it bleeds every time I brush which is morning and evening. I try to take good care of my teeth so I'm super paranoid about this, it's been really uncomfortable to chew on that side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny insights or theories would be appreciated, or if there's a better subreddit to post onto.

For example I picked Croatia over Argentina for yesterdays match, and croatia ended up winning after all. But it's still locked. What gives?",

Advanced game play-probs Masters cuz it’s been around longer so more complex right now. What makes it great- too early to tell, why did they make a new game? Idk Bandai is just gonna Bandai, maybe they wanted to start over with a simpler game to attract new players. Bandai makes both games, so same company. Old one is still running so far. Card sizes are the same are one piece, magic, Pokémon. Investment to get started: get a starter pack if you can find one for msrp. The digital version comes out on the 29th. Or just look up builds on YouTube and get singles from tcgplayer",
