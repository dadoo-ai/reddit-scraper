Its becoming harder to manager a FT software engineer job. I am on transplant list but that comes with its own set of problems. I work at a big tech adjacent tier 2/3 company as a senior software engineer. Due to kidney failure I have brain fog and unable to grok lot of concepts easily. I am also older dude (47). I would like to down shift my career to pick up a lower stressful job until I can call it quits from tech. Has anyone been in this position. I am really lost. ",
