    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo earlier I was thinking about the fact that Gamestop had already issued an open share market agreement back in Dec2020 and the fact that DFV seems to have been hinting about 3 year cycles or LEAPS or whatever you want to make of that.\n\nI thought maybe I could look back at DFV's Youtube for when the announcement was made and before i could even find the right video I couldn't help but notice so many of his memes relate to his live streams, **it's been right in front of us the whole time!**\n\nDFV can't really post anything outside of memes at the moment but DFV LOVES MEMES and he has included them right throughout his videos all along. He could be using them now to get us to go back and do some research on what might be happening. **Maybe the reverse stuff means to go back and watch these streams!**\n\nLet me explain, below I have taken screenshots of the stream thumbnails and a link to the stream, there are even more than this but this is just to show you and encourage you to go and check it out:\n\n**Emojis and hieroglyphics**\n\n[Stream link ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5U2Uo-B0Ts)\n\n[Stream Thumbnail](https://preview.redd.it/rowl0qkpk51d1.png?width=297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=463e42c609493bfe70e994c36f8984f31e91de81)\n\n**The Truman Show**\n\n[Stream link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aQsdR2ViMs) **(this is the stream that talks about the last time Gamestop did a shelf offering if you want to hear DFV's thoughts on that in Dec2020, specifically from 1:16:00 but all along the stream too)**\n\n[Stream Thumbnail](https://preview.redd.it/6ym4xz6jk51d1.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7c286b8e99ec49c6e7b599e1b94be536f21ae20)\n\n**Fight Club**\n\n[Stream link ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybw5nMCbi1A)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10ffsxp9n51d1.png?width=316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4569bed813252001100b10402636ddd6b0771451\n\n**V for Vendetta / Oceans 11**\n\n[Stream link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-k-_tCZ1xs)\n\n[Stream link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVpFp69nviQ)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kyh6hnvpl51d1.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4694220b361f49c305dca84b14af27bb6976985d\n\n**The Matrix**\n\n[Stream link ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNq-CZiMLIA)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf6my3hvl51d1.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a892f9df4bc6e1e7364ba41167d2ef6bcf5cb8e1\n\n**No country for old men**\n\n[Stream link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmHNkObwcd8)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4237y362m51d1.png?width=313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eea79016c350a9ccee293aa80679561132f7897\n\n**Halloween**\n\n[Stream link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3MEuZxYCeU)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ozckmkam51d1.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5e4195fdf1764632d84cfa91eca3847be8c6098\n\n**Avengers and Forrest Gump**\n\n[Stream Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDhfJFvH_lo)\n\n[Stream Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TayCdHlJWu0)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhwf1s67o51d1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e12e56b0b319ff4255893fd0e9ee76a0eb8f7c04\n\nStupid draft thing cut off the rest of what i said:\n\nIf we get more memes next week, expect to see any of the following:\n\n* Jurassic Park\n* Silence of the Lambs\n* Enders Game\n* We know what you did last summer\n* Goodfellas\n* Gangsta's paradise by Coolio\n* Jerry Maguire\n* Alien\n* The Game\n* Ghostbusters\n* Happy Gilmore\n* Queen's Gambit\n\nI haven't got time to go through all these videos but i've been watching all morning the halloween stream.

    "communityName": "r/Superstonk",
    "parsedCommunityName": "Superstonk",
    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've had to do this whole post again (absolutely gutted) as the draft function let me down so sorry if I skip through a bit quicker...\n\nAnother day, another set of memes to look through. As always, you can catch my previous day round ups below:\n\n[13th May](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1crq93w/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_a_humble_apes_opinion/)\n\n[14th May](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1csixeq/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_14th_may_a_humble/)\n\n[15th May](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctazks/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_15th_may_a_humble/)\n\nTo reiterate, the description of each tweet is to the best of my knowledge the references made to allow you to make your own view in context and the speculation is pure speculation on my part. If you just want to look at the descriptions and not the speculation then just ignore the speculation part.\n\nThis is just for fun and shouldn't be taken as any financial advice, make your own decisions, I just like the stock.\n\nIf you have anything to add feel free to in the comments.\n\nLet's begin:\n\n**10am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791106334517010680](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791106334517010680)\n\n**Description:** First we have Jigsaw from Saw, \"Hello, Do you want to play a game?\", it then cuts to The Prestige with the quote \"are you watching closely?\" and then it cuts to Lucky Number Slevin talking about the Kansas city shuffle and finally it's Nas with Made you look.\n\n**Speculation:** Jigsaw used to capture people who were not looking to live their life and play games with them to show them that they actually do care about their lives in the end. Maybe DFV is referring to shorts desperately trying to get out of their position and showing they will do whatever it takes to do it. The Prestige quote comes from the scene [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqduf3g__jE) and shows a magic trick of money appearing. The Kansas City Shuffle is \"In order for a confidence game to be a \"Kansas City Shuffle\", the mark must be aware, or at least suspect that he is involved in a con, but also be wrong about how the con artist is planning to deceive him. The con artist will attempt to misdirect the mark in a way that leaves him with the impression that he has figured out the game and has the knowledge necessary to outsmart the con artist, but by attempting to retaliate, the mark unwittingly performs an action that helps the con artist to further the scheme\" and the Made you Look songs full line is \"They shootin', Aw made you look\" maybe referring to what is happening to the stock right now.\n\n**10.15am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791110102797172804](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791110102797172804)\n\n**Description:** Here we have a scene from Kill Bill where the bride is about to take on the crazy 88 gang and the music Nobody but Me by The Human Beinz.\n\n**Speculation:** On the theme of ultimate revenge, The Bride in Kill Bill was on a mission to well.. kill bill. Lots of to go through in order to get to the final boss and the song is maybe making a point that Nobody but DFV could have seen this coming or maybe he is saying RCEO can do it\n\n**10.30am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791113879684325383](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791113879684325383)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from Inside Man, i think it's the opening scene and has the music Chaiyya Chaiyya, also taken from the original clip. DFV has imposed a cat looking over and listening to the monologue which reads \"Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself\".\n\n**Speculation:** Inside man is about an elaborate heist turned hostage movie on Wall Street. Don't think there is much more to say about that other than GME is most likely the hostage in this situation.\n\n**10.45am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791117652276195516](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791117652276195516)\n\n**Description:** The first part of this meme is taken from The Office and Michael pulls up in a car with Lady Gaga - Let's Dance playing and states \"it's Britney Bitch\". We then cut to Britney Spears in her music video Hit Me Baby One More Time and the part \"give me a sign\" has the movie logo for Signs on it (much more of that to come)\n\n**Speculation:** First part is a joke from DFV keeping the just dance theme going but then we go to hit me baby one more time and most importantly a reference to a \"Just give me a sign\". There are signs coming that something big is going to happen.\n\n**11am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791121430836584789](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791121430836584789)\n\n**Description:** This is the intro to Goosebumps and follows a lot of the original clips theme, you can watch that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YbzxhkLlwc). Some key changes that have been made though, R.K Gill is on the briefcase, something has definitely been edited with the man's head holding the briefcase, the billboard shows a morph to Ryan Cohen, Ryan's dog is brought in and then it's \"Bear Beware\" and \"Goosebumps, based on the memes by R.K Gill\"\n\n**Speculation:** This is a really fun meme, we see some more of RC and Roaring Kitty Gill all over this. Is there a partnership or does DFV just know that RCEO is about to do something big that will send goosebumps down the bears necks.\n\n**11.15am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791125203147428066](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791125203147428066)\n\n**Description:** Next we have Broad City and the song Best Friend by Sofi Tukker. The meme basically just has lots of scenes around new york with friends just doing a lot of dancing. Just a fun meme of dancing really and a lot of it centers around the two best friends the sitcom is about.\n\n**Speculation:** DFV and RCEO are best pals and with everything that is going on with the stock they are just dancing and having a great time. Essentially owning New York which of course is where the finance bros hang out.\n\n**11.30am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791128976632459643](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791128976632459643)\n\n**Description:** The first scene is taken from Devil Wears Prada with the models hanging out in New York for a shoot and the song Crazy by Seal plays with the lyrics \"we're never gonna survive, unless we get a little crazy\"  it cuts to the official music video then back to Devil wears Prada where they say \"oh i get it, the piece is called urban jungle right?\", \"yes the modern investor unleashes the animal within to take on the big city\" Roarrr\n\n**Speculation:** Another meme from New York with predominantly girls hanging out. DFV maybe noting that we all unleash a little roaring kitty by taking on his thesis with Gamestop, dunno about you but I just like the stock. Things might get a little crazy, at least to people on the outside when they are asking you why you aren't selling.\n\n**11.45am -**  [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791132751976120778](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791132751976120778)\n\n**Description:** This scene is taken from the movie Signs and the Rev Graham here is woken and staring at something on the roof that spooks him.\n\n**Speculation:** There will be many more references to this movie, in this case the Rev Graham (who weirdly looks like Ken G) is getting spooked at something he thought he saw. Scary stuff if you are short on GME.\n\n**12.00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791136527801807077](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791136527801807077)\n\n**Description:** This is also taken from the movie Signs and it's a quote, \"See what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, that sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Or, look at the question this way: Is it possible that there are no coincidences?\"\n\n**Speculation:** Something big is coming, what kind of person are you? Is it possible there are no Cohencidences?\n\n**12.15pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791140301895352325](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791140301895352325)\n\n**Description:** Again from Signs, this shows the scene where the kid takes out his baby monitor and claims he can hear the aliens talking to each other. There's two of them talking he states and again we see the sign logo flash up. We then see an overlay of alien writing that isn't in the original clip so that's been dubbed on purposely.\n\n**Speculation:** Things starting to get real interesting now. This looks to be a sign that something is happening behind the scenes. A baby monitor, what's RCEO got stored up? Maybe he is pregnant? Maybe GME is pregnant? Is there a merger happening? A split of some sort?\n\n**12.30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791144075963298165](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791144075963298165)\n\n**Description:** This is the scene in Signs where they go to the crop fields and there are alien crop circles everywhere, only in this meme DFV has replaced those circles with GME logos. Many GME logos some with long running lines.\n\n**Speculation:** Really looking like something big is on the horizon and DFV thinks he has seen the signs. This meme would suggest maybe its a merger with multiple gamestop logos but that's just my opinion. One thing for sure is that Gamestop has something on the horizon.\n\n**12.45pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791147851466047673](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791147851466047673)\n\n**Description:** This is the scene in Signs where the news start reporting sightings of aliens and they show a load of kids in a different country looking down an alley way only for an alien bearing Roaring Kitty as a face to walk by, scary stuff!\n\n**Speculation:** This was actually the first scene from this film that made me realize i had seen the film before and a younger me was pretty freaked out by that scene. It could imply that they have landed, they are here and or DFV is at least. Certainly a they are coming sort of message.\n\n**1.00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791151631259574559](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791151631259574559)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from the animated film Luca, where one kid says \"what does it mean, the thing you just said?\" and the other kid goes \"Come on Ill show you more stuff\"\n\n**Speculation:** I think this is aimed at me writing this right now and whoever is reading this right now. Ultimately i have no idea what DFV is saying i can only speculate and DFV knows that, he can't outright say what he thinks but he can show us more and more cool memes.\n\n**1.15pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791155401091596494](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791155401091596494)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from 500 days of summer and DFV has changed a lot of the words here but essentially he is asked what he does and he says he makes Gamestop memes, the woman says he could be a really great investor if he wanted to be, he is asked why he went from being a great investor to making gamestop memes and he says \"why make something disposable, like an investment thesis, when you can make something that lasts forever like a Gamestop meme\"\n\n**Speculation:** DFV having more meme lols here but really why would he need to do anymore investing, he already has his favourite company shares and the thesis is done, he knows what's going on and he is happy to stick with what he has. That doens't mean his thesis on Gamestop doesn't evolve, I just think he is done looking for other deep value plays.\n\n**1.30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791159177785770273](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791159177785770273)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from The Shining and the song dubbed on is Matter of Time by Vandelux. The main protagonist and author in the movie, Jack is sat writing and it seems it is DFV and he is writing memes.\n\n**Speculation:** Anyone that has seen The Shining knows that Jack goes to a secluded house with no distractions to write his book. Turns out it actually just makes him go completely mental and he ends up killing his family. I think DFV is just having some fun showcasing the time he has spent focusing on making Gamestop memes.\n\n**1.45pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791162950373527857](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791162950373527857)\n\n**Description:** We have Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See by Busta Rhymes and his music video. The lyrics he has chosen for this clip are emphasized and they are:\n\nFlipmode  \nBusta Bus (*Uh, what?*)  \nNine-seven (*Come on, what?*)  \nHot shit (*Ha-hah*)  \nCheck it out\n\nHit you with no delayin' so what you sayin', yo? (*Uhh*)  \nSilly with my nine milli, what the deally, yo? (*What?*)\n\nDo you really wanna party with me?  \nLet me see (*Uh*) just what you got for me (*Come on*)  \nPut all your hands where my eyes can see (*Put 'em up, yo*)  \nStraight buckwildin' in the place to be (*Wildin', nice, ha*)\n\nIt then ends with If you really wanna party with Roaring Kitty\n\n**Speculation:** More fun and dancing. Some interesting lyrics, Flipmode (reverse uno card anyone), Silly with my nine milli (could relate to shares, does RCEO have that much?) Could just be a fun meme without much else to it.\n\n**2:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791166726891061749](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791166726891061749)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from Sicario and it starts with the quote \"so you wanna be a Sicario\" and then shows the blonde reddit icon from the other sub tied up and then a guy looking pretty pissed off.\n\n**Speculation:** The Sicarios were hitmen, that's basically what it means when it asks if you want to be a Sicario, do you want to be a hitman or assassin. The blonde icon from other sub tied up is in the place of a kid who was tied up in the film and certainly WAS NOT a friend of the Sicarios. Take from that what you will but I can't comment to much as it's about another sub.\n\n**2.15pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791170783277949042](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791170783277949042)\n\n**Description:** First we have a scene from No Country for Old Men with the quote \"you can't stop what's comin\" then we cut to a train tearing it up in Chicago and also taking out a double deck chair with a Chicago Bears logo on it then finally we go to a WWE smackdown with Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\n**Speculation:** No Country for Old Men has cropped up a few times before but it's about a killer who is pretty much unstoppable mowing these people down. The train wrecking Chicago and the Chicago Bears (as a Packers fan i liked that), well option contract writers are in Chicago I believe but also it's the original home of Citadel. The chair maybe is an answer to a Cramer tweet and the smackdown i'm not sure other than it being just a fun thing to watch.\n\n**2.30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791174276604699013](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791174276604699013)\n\n**Description:** This is the music video for Punkrocker by Teddybears. It basically follows a man who is being chased by the police, the cops are coming but the guy seems pretty chill about it. He listens to the music with no fear and you can too. The words are in Gamestop white and red.\n\n**Speculation:** I think that this could indicate that Gamestop isn't doing anything wrong with what's going to happen, they have warned again and again in their financial postings that the stock is being manipulated and is subject to squeezes. It could also indicate a GME investor has nothing to worry about legally either, just like the stock.\n\n**2.45pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791178049939182048](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791178049939182048)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from The School of Rock where Jack Black is trying to ask what it takes to rock out. If you wanna rock its not about scoring chicks, it's not about getting wasted, its about sticking it to the man, and you can't just say it man you gotta FEEL it it in your blood and guts.\n\n**Speculation:** Only you can decide what sticking it to man means yourself in relation to having GME stock during a big squeeze event but for me personally it's been a long 3 and a half years of having crap tossed at me just for owning this stock and i certainly pissed with the amount of corruption and cheating that has and continues to go on. If shorts never closed and still have that position, that's their mess not mine.\n\n**3.00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791181824754106742](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791181824754106742)\n\n**Description:** The main scene in this meme is taken from the film Stand By Me. You have two cars on both sides of the road. The good guy in this is driving on the wrong side of the road and the other gang are on the right side, it's a game of chicken with a truck coming towards the good guy as they both drive side by side. It then cuts to Bojack Horseman trying to do some comedy and being asked to get off stage, he states \"I'm not done hold on\" - it cuts back to the scene and the truck bails last second. The good guy just keeps on driving and goes in front of the other car having a victory sip.\n\n**Speculation:** If you take DFV to be the good guy in this car scene then he just carries on with what he believes which is in GME regardless of trying to be chickened out of it in the face of adversity. You could also say he is Bojack and wanting to continue with his memes, he ain't done telling his memeroirs yet.\n\n**3.15pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791185600453783688](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791185600453783688)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from Everything Everywhere All At Once and shows a woman showcasing her awards, DFV has imposed some cat photos on her desk and also 3 awards that read\n\n* DeepFuckingValue, Degen of the Month\n* Roaring Kitty, 1st Cat in Congress\n* Keith Gill, Best Ethics from the CFA institute (lol)\n\n\"The quote is Do you see these? You don't get one of these unless you've seen a lot of bullshit. Excuse my French. Now you may only see a pile of boring forms and numbers, but I see a story.\"\n\n**Speculation:** DFV is a fucking dude, the guy has a meme trophy cabinet. To us or others we just don't quite see it like he does. If DFV thinks something big is going to happen you have the choice to believe it too or not, that's completely up to you. The awards are lol.\n\n**3.30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791189376195854606](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791189376195854606)\n\n**Description:** The first scene is taken from Garden State, he asks her \"what are you listening to\", she goes \"you gotta hear this one song\" and you then hear Dont Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult and the opening lyric \"all our times have come\"\n\n**Speculation:** Don't fear the reaper, if you hold GME you don't have to as it's not going bust. The company is not going to die. There are certainly some shorts that should be fearing the reaper though.\n\n**3.45pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791193149408223306](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791193149408223306)\n\n**Description:** This is a hilarious meme and i'm not sure where this is taken from but i'll try my best to describe it (really you should just watch it though). Two men are in a rich guys house, the host writes a note and then has to leave tearing the note off and taking it with him, the other sneaks up to the notepad, labelled Cohen, and tries to sketch the next page to work out what he wrote. What is revealed is a cartoon man with a huge dick.\n\n**Speculation:** RCEO has a big slong, what else is there to say? Ok I think that he is going to do something big and it's an exciting thing to think about. Does make you think of the tweet of Steve Smith he posted with the erect penis too.\n\n**4.00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791196925619789864](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791196925619789864)\n\n**Description:** A more recently made meme shows Jay Clayton talking about Roaring Kitty showing his first meme and saying \"is this something that we should be tolerating in our markets, whether it's legal lalallull\" then it goes to a clip of a guy saying \"i mean what did he say fuck me for\"\n\n**Speculation:** DFV basically saying as we would say in the UK, \"whatever mate\". The guy is talking a load of bullshit and to bring up legality after all the stuff he has let slide as former SEC chairman, i mean bitch please!\n\n**Edit\\*** \n\n**8.00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791257325451493396](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791257325451493396)\n\n**Description:** First scene is taken from the car chase in The Bourne Identity, DFV has imposed a load of pictures of himself on the sheet of paper and then the car chase from the police proceeds (original clip [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD0VD3LElOI)) There is a part in the middle of this car chase where the footage has been mirror flipped which means the steering wheel that would read Mini reads INIM then it finishes the chase and moves on to the opening scene of the movie Drive (original clip [here](https://youtu.be/d_WdKrUGkEo?si=vAMwnxOEKuxIUC8T)). \n\n**Speculation:** I think that the mirror flip of the video shows the steering wheel just at that point to sort of read \"IM IN\", surely not a coincidence given that is the only part of the whole clip that is flipped. The movie drive as someone suggested in the comments is about, \"Ryan Gosling plays the unnamed Driver, a near-silent, methodical, mysterious, professional, highly competent getaway driver.\" - DFV has also tweeted about this movie before [here](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790064464357724451?t=CJxy_IIvdpQdESw1i_AZ7w&amp;s=19).\n\nHope you enjoyed, still pissed i had to write this twice, my original had a lot more links to original clips and each Superstonk post as well! I'm off to bed, i'll update with the 8pm tweet tomorrow.\n\nLove ya DFV x",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had to do this whole post again (absolutely gutted) as the draft function let me down so sorry if I skip through a bit quicker...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another day, another set of memes to look through. As always, you can catch my previous day round ups below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1crq93w/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_a_humble_apes_opinion/\"&gt;13th May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1csixeq/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_14th_may_a_humble/\"&gt;14th May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctazks/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_15th_may_a_humble/\"&gt;15th May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, the description of each tweet is to the best of my knowledge the references made to allow you to make your own view in context and the speculation is pure speculation on my part. If you just want to look at the descriptions and not the speculation then just ignore the speculation part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just for fun and shouldn&amp;#39;t be taken as any financial advice, make your own decisions, I just like the stock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have anything to add feel free to in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s begin:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791106334517010680\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791106334517010680&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First we have Jigsaw from Saw, &amp;quot;Hello, Do you want to play a game?&amp;quot;, it then cuts to The Prestige with the quote &amp;quot;are you watching closely?&amp;quot; and then it cuts to Lucky Number Slevin talking about the Kansas city shuffle and finally it&amp;#39;s Nas with Made you look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Jigsaw used to capture people who were not looking to live their life and play games with them to show them that they actually do care about their lives in the end. Maybe DFV is referring to shorts desperately trying to get out of their position and showing they will do whatever it takes to do it. The Prestige quote comes from the scene &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqduf3g__jE\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and shows a magic trick of money appearing. The Kansas City Shuffle is &amp;quot;In order for a confidence game to be a &amp;quot;Kansas City Shuffle&amp;quot;, the mark must be aware, or at least suspect that he is involved in a con, but also be wrong about how the con artist is planning to deceive him. The con artist will attempt to misdirect the mark in a way that leaves him with the impression that he has figured out the game and has the knowledge necessary to outsmart the con artist, but by attempting to retaliate, the mark unwittingly performs an action that helps the con artist to further the scheme&amp;quot; and the Made you Look songs full line is &amp;quot;They shootin&amp;#39;, Aw made you look&amp;quot; maybe referring to what is happening to the stock right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.15am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791110102797172804\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791110102797172804&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Here we have a scene from Kill Bill where the bride is about to take on the crazy 88 gang and the music Nobody but Me by The Human Beinz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; On the theme of ultimate revenge, The Bride in Kill Bill was on a mission to well.. kill bill. Lots of to go through in order to get to the final boss and the song is maybe making a point that Nobody but DFV could have seen this coming or maybe he is saying RCEO can do it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.30am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791113879684325383\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791113879684325383&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from Inside Man, i think it&amp;#39;s the opening scene and has the music Chaiyya Chaiyya, also taken from the original clip. DFV has imposed a cat looking over and listening to the monologue which reads &amp;quot;Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Inside man is about an elaborate heist turned hostage movie on Wall Street. Don&amp;#39;t think there is much more to say about that other than GME is most likely the hostage in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.45am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791117652276195516\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791117652276195516&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; The first part of this meme is taken from The Office and Michael pulls up in a car with Lady Gaga - Let&amp;#39;s Dance playing and states &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s Britney Bitch&amp;quot;. We then cut to Britney Spears in her music video Hit Me Baby One More Time and the part &amp;quot;give me a sign&amp;quot; has the movie logo for Signs on it (much more of that to come)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; First part is a joke from DFV keeping the just dance theme going but then we go to hit me baby one more time and most importantly a reference to a &amp;quot;Just give me a sign&amp;quot;. There are signs coming that something big is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791121430836584789\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791121430836584789&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the intro to Goosebumps and follows a lot of the original clips theme, you can watch that &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YbzxhkLlwc\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Some key changes that have been made though, R.K Gill is on the briefcase, something has definitely been edited with the man&amp;#39;s head holding the briefcase, the billboard shows a morph to Ryan Cohen, Ryan&amp;#39;s dog is brought in and then it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Bear Beware&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Goosebumps, based on the memes by R.K Gill&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a really fun meme, we see some more of RC and Roaring Kitty Gill all over this. Is there a partnership or does DFV just know that RCEO is about to do something big that will send goosebumps down the bears necks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.15am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791125203147428066\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791125203147428066&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Next we have Broad City and the song Best Friend by Sofi Tukker. The meme basically just has lots of scenes around new york with friends just doing a lot of dancing. Just a fun meme of dancing really and a lot of it centers around the two best friends the sitcom is about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; DFV and RCEO are best pals and with everything that is going on with the stock they are just dancing and having a great time. Essentially owning New York which of course is where the finance bros hang out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.30am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791128976632459643\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791128976632459643&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; The first scene is taken from Devil Wears Prada with the models hanging out in New York for a shoot and the song Crazy by Seal plays with the lyrics &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re never gonna survive, unless we get a little crazy&amp;quot;  it cuts to the official music video then back to Devil wears Prada where they say &amp;quot;oh i get it, the piece is called urban jungle right?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;yes the modern investor unleashes the animal within to take on the big city&amp;quot; Roarrr&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Another meme from New York with predominantly girls hanging out. DFV maybe noting that we all unleash a little roaring kitty by taking on his thesis with Gamestop, dunno about you but I just like the stock. Things might get a little crazy, at least to people on the outside when they are asking you why you aren&amp;#39;t selling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.45am -&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791132751976120778\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791132751976120778&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This scene is taken from the movie Signs and the Rev Graham here is woken and staring at something on the roof that spooks him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; There will be many more references to this movie, in this case the Rev Graham (who weirdly looks like Ken G) is getting spooked at something he thought he saw. Scary stuff if you are short on GME.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791136527801807077\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791136527801807077&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is also taken from the movie Signs and it&amp;#39;s a quote, &amp;quot;See what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, that sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Or, look at the question this way: Is it possible that there are no coincidences?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Something big is coming, what kind of person are you? Is it possible there are no Cohencidences?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.15pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791140301895352325\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791140301895352325&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Again from Signs, this shows the scene where the kid takes out his baby monitor and claims he can hear the aliens talking to each other. There&amp;#39;s two of them talking he states and again we see the sign logo flash up. We then see an overlay of alien writing that isn&amp;#39;t in the original clip so that&amp;#39;s been dubbed on purposely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Things starting to get real interesting now. This looks to be a sign that something is happening behind the scenes. A baby monitor, what&amp;#39;s RCEO got stored up? Maybe he is pregnant? Maybe GME is pregnant? Is there a merger happening? A split of some sort?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791144075963298165\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791144075963298165&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the scene in Signs where they go to the crop fields and there are alien crop circles everywhere, only in this meme DFV has replaced those circles with GME logos. Many GME logos some with long running lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Really looking like something big is on the horizon and DFV thinks he has seen the signs. This meme would suggest maybe its a merger with multiple gamestop logos but that&amp;#39;s just my opinion. One thing for sure is that Gamestop has something on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.45pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791147851466047673\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791147851466047673&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the scene in Signs where the news start reporting sightings of aliens and they show a load of kids in a different country looking down an alley way only for an alien bearing Roaring Kitty as a face to walk by, scary stuff!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This was actually the first scene from this film that made me realize i had seen the film before and a younger me was pretty freaked out by that scene. It could imply that they have landed, they are here and or DFV is at least. Certainly a they are coming sort of message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791151631259574559\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791151631259574559&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from the animated film Luca, where one kid says &amp;quot;what does it mean, the thing you just said?&amp;quot; and the other kid goes &amp;quot;Come on Ill show you more stuff&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I think this is aimed at me writing this right now and whoever is reading this right now. Ultimately i have no idea what DFV is saying i can only speculate and DFV knows that, he can&amp;#39;t outright say what he thinks but he can show us more and more cool memes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.15pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791155401091596494\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791155401091596494&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from 500 days of summer and DFV has changed a lot of the words here but essentially he is asked what he does and he says he makes Gamestop memes, the woman says he could be a really great investor if he wanted to be, he is asked why he went from being a great investor to making gamestop memes and he says &amp;quot;why make something disposable, like an investment thesis, when you can make something that lasts forever like a Gamestop meme&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; DFV having more meme lols here but really why would he need to do anymore investing, he already has his favourite company shares and the thesis is done, he knows what&amp;#39;s going on and he is happy to stick with what he has. That doens&amp;#39;t mean his thesis on Gamestop doesn&amp;#39;t evolve, I just think he is done looking for other deep value plays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791159177785770273\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791159177785770273&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from The Shining and the song dubbed on is Matter of Time by Vandelux. The main protagonist and author in the movie, Jack is sat writing and it seems it is DFV and he is writing memes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone that has seen The Shining knows that Jack goes to a secluded house with no distractions to write his book. Turns out it actually just makes him go completely mental and he ends up killing his family. I think DFV is just having some fun showcasing the time he has spent focusing on making Gamestop memes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.45pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791162950373527857\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791162950373527857&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; We have Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See by Busta Rhymes and his music video. The lyrics he has chosen for this clip are emphasized and they are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flipmode&lt;br/&gt;\nBusta Bus (&lt;em&gt;Uh, what?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;\nNine-seven (&lt;em&gt;Come on, what?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;\nHot shit (&lt;em&gt;Ha-hah&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;\nCheck it out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hit you with no delayin&amp;#39; so what you sayin&amp;#39;, yo? (&lt;em&gt;Uhh&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;\nSilly with my nine milli, what the deally, yo? (&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you really wanna party with me?&lt;br/&gt;\nLet me see (&lt;em&gt;Uh&lt;/em&gt;) just what you got for me (&lt;em&gt;Come on&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;\nPut all your hands where my eyes can see (&lt;em&gt;Put &amp;#39;em up, yo&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;\nStraight buckwildin&amp;#39; in the place to be (&lt;em&gt;Wildin&amp;#39;, nice, ha&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It then ends with If you really wanna party with Roaring Kitty&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; More fun and dancing. Some interesting lyrics, Flipmode (reverse uno card anyone), Silly with my nine milli (could relate to shares, does RCEO have that much?) Could just be a fun meme without much else to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791166726891061749\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791166726891061749&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from Sicario and it starts with the quote &amp;quot;so you wanna be a Sicario&amp;quot; and then shows the blonde reddit icon from the other sub tied up and then a guy looking pretty pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Sicarios were hitmen, that&amp;#39;s basically what it means when it asks if you want to be a Sicario, do you want to be a hitman or assassin. The blonde icon from other sub tied up is in the place of a kid who was tied up in the film and certainly WAS NOT a friend of the Sicarios. Take from that what you will but I can&amp;#39;t comment to much as it&amp;#39;s about another sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.15pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791170783277949042\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791170783277949042&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First we have a scene from No Country for Old Men with the quote &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t stop what&amp;#39;s comin&amp;quot; then we cut to a train tearing it up in Chicago and also taking out a double deck chair with a Chicago Bears logo on it then finally we go to a WWE smackdown with Stone Cold Steve Austin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; No Country for Old Men has cropped up a few times before but it&amp;#39;s about a killer who is pretty much unstoppable mowing these people down. The train wrecking Chicago and the Chicago Bears (as a Packers fan i liked that), well option contract writers are in Chicago I believe but also it&amp;#39;s the original home of Citadel. The chair maybe is an answer to a Cramer tweet and the smackdown i&amp;#39;m not sure other than it being just a fun thing to watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791174276604699013\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791174276604699013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the music video for Punkrocker by Teddybears. It basically follows a man who is being chased by the police, the cops are coming but the guy seems pretty chill about it. He listens to the music with no fear and you can too. The words are in Gamestop white and red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that this could indicate that Gamestop isn&amp;#39;t doing anything wrong with what&amp;#39;s going to happen, they have warned again and again in their financial postings that the stock is being manipulated and is subject to squeezes. It could also indicate a GME investor has nothing to worry about legally either, just like the stock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.45pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791178049939182048\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791178049939182048&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from The School of Rock where Jack Black is trying to ask what it takes to rock out. If you wanna rock its not about scoring chicks, it&amp;#39;s not about getting wasted, its about sticking it to the man, and you can&amp;#39;t just say it man you gotta FEEL it it in your blood and guts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Only you can decide what sticking it to man means yourself in relation to having GME stock during a big squeeze event but for me personally it&amp;#39;s been a long 3 and a half years of having crap tossed at me just for owning this stock and i certainly pissed with the amount of corruption and cheating that has and continues to go on. If shorts never closed and still have that position, that&amp;#39;s their mess not mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791181824754106742\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791181824754106742&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; The main scene in this meme is taken from the film Stand By Me. You have two cars on both sides of the road. The good guy in this is driving on the wrong side of the road and the other gang are on the right side, it&amp;#39;s a game of chicken with a truck coming towards the good guy as they both drive side by side. It then cuts to Bojack Horseman trying to do some comedy and being asked to get off stage, he states &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not done hold on&amp;quot; - it cuts back to the scene and the truck bails last second. The good guy just keeps on driving and goes in front of the other car having a victory sip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; If you take DFV to be the good guy in this car scene then he just carries on with what he believes which is in GME regardless of trying to be chickened out of it in the face of adversity. You could also say he is Bojack and wanting to continue with his memes, he ain&amp;#39;t done telling his memeroirs yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.15pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791185600453783688\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791185600453783688&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from Everything Everywhere All At Once and shows a woman showcasing her awards, DFV has imposed some cat photos on her desk and also 3 awards that read&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DeepFuckingValue, Degen of the Month&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Roaring Kitty, 1st Cat in Congress&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keith Gill, Best Ethics from the CFA institute (lol)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The quote is Do you see these? You don&amp;#39;t get one of these unless you&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of bullshit. Excuse my French. Now you may only see a pile of boring forms and numbers, but I see a story.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; DFV is a fucking dude, the guy has a meme trophy cabinet. To us or others we just don&amp;#39;t quite see it like he does. If DFV thinks something big is going to happen you have the choice to believe it too or not, that&amp;#39;s completely up to you. The awards are lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791189376195854606\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791189376195854606&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; The first scene is taken from Garden State, he asks her &amp;quot;what are you listening to&amp;quot;, she goes &amp;quot;you gotta hear this one song&amp;quot; and you then hear Dont Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult and the opening lyric &amp;quot;all our times have come&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#39;t fear the reaper, if you hold GME you don&amp;#39;t have to as it&amp;#39;s not going bust. The company is not going to die. There are certainly some shorts that should be fearing the reaper though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.45pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791193149408223306\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791193149408223306&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a hilarious meme and i&amp;#39;m not sure where this is taken from but i&amp;#39;ll try my best to describe it (really you should just watch it though). Two men are in a rich guys house, the host writes a note and then has to leave tearing the note off and taking it with him, the other sneaks up to the notepad, labelled Cohen, and tries to sketch the next page to work out what he wrote. What is revealed is a cartoon man with a huge dick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; RCEO has a big slong, what else is there to say? Ok I think that he is going to do something big and it&amp;#39;s an exciting thing to think about. Does make you think of the tweet of Steve Smith he posted with the erect penis too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791196925619789864\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791196925619789864&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; A more recently made meme shows Jay Clayton talking about Roaring Kitty showing his first meme and saying &amp;quot;is this something that we should be tolerating in our markets, whether it&amp;#39;s legal lalallull&amp;quot; then it goes to a clip of a guy saying &amp;quot;i mean what did he say fuck me for&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; DFV basically saying as we would say in the UK, &amp;quot;whatever mate&amp;quot;. The guy is talking a load of bullshit and to bring up legality after all the stuff he has let slide as former SEC chairman, i mean bitch please!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit\\&lt;/strong&gt;* &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791257325451493396\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791257325451493396&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First scene is taken from the car chase in The Bourne Identity, DFV has imposed a load of pictures of himself on the sheet of paper and then the car chase from the police proceeds (original clip &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD0VD3LElOI\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) There is a part in the middle of this car chase where the footage has been mirror flipped which means the steering wheel that would read Mini reads INIM then it finishes the chase and moves on to the opening scene of the movie Drive (original clip &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/d_WdKrUGkEo?si=vAMwnxOEKuxIUC8T\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that the mirror flip of the video shows the steering wheel just at that point to sort of read &amp;quot;IM IN&amp;quot;, surely not a coincidence given that is the only part of the whole clip that is flipped. The movie drive as someone suggested in the comments is about, &amp;quot;Ryan Gosling plays the unnamed Driver, a near-silent, methodical, mysterious, professional, highly competent getaway driver.&amp;quot; - DFV has also tweeted about this movie before &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790064464357724451?t=CJxy_IIvdpQdESw1i_AZ7w&amp;amp;s=19\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed, still pissed i had to write this twice, my original had a lot more links to original clips and each Superstonk post as well! I&amp;#39;m off to bed, i&amp;#39;ll update with the 8pm tweet tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love ya DFV x&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "communityName": "r/Superstonk",
    "parsedCommunityName": "Superstonk",
    "body": "Hello Apes,\n\nHere's another review of Roaring Kitty tweets, if you wanna check out previous days then links are below:\n\n[13th May](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1crq93w/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_a_humble_apes_opinion/)\n\n[14th May](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1csixeq/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_14th_may_a_humble/)\n\nTo reiterate, the description of each tweet is to the best of my knowledge the references made to allow you to make your own view in context and the speculation is pure speculation on my part, this is just for fun and shouldn't be taken as any financial advice, make your own decisions, I just like the stock. If you have anything to add feel free to in the comments and I'll do my best to update the post but given the amount of tweets now i don't have lots of time.\n\n**8:00am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790713748866371690](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790713748866371690)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from the film Easy-A and shows Emma Stone walking through school catching a lot of attention looking fine and what was an A sticker in the original clip has been replaced with the Gamestop play logo. The song is Sexy Silk by Jessie J\n\n**Speculation:** The stock is sexy, particularly among the younger people. What was Easy-A is now Easy-Gamestop. Looking really great in the black.\n\n**8.15am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790717515523658119](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790717515523658119)\n\n**Description:** First we have a scene from the movie Prestige, with a Michael Caine voiceover about a magicians magic trick of making something disappear. The quote is \"The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.\" Meanwhile a person with a gamestop logo is being electrocuted to life a little frankenstein like and then a Gamestop logo bursts through an explosion. We then go to a fight scene with the song \"back in the saddle again\" by Aerosmith playing.\n\n**Speculation:** The quote from the Prestige in full talks about the different parts of making something disappear. In full \" Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called \"The Pledge\". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called \"The Turn\". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call \"The Prestige\".\" The Aerosmith song also has some interesting lyrics, \"Ridin' into town alone by the light of the moon\" \"I'm ridin', I'm loadin' up my pistol, I'm ridin', I really got a fistful, I'm ridin', I'm shinin' up my saddle, I'm ridin', this snake is gonna rattle\"\n\n**8.30am -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790721293089964126](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790721293089964126)\n\n**Description:** Not sure what film this is from but essentially we have a group of people looking for someone who is messing with them, they come across the infamous meme of death looking for Gamestop and then they track down Roaring Kitty alongside 893489 CHIMP located in Boston. We then get a message of Prep mode and arm ready for transport, hold pattern until further notice and a message again on a watch saying the same with a Gamestop logo\n\n**Speculation:** WS looking for DFV and just coming across more memes, not really understanding it. As pointed out by many, 893489 is the hexcode for purple [https://www.colorhexa.com/893489](https://www.colorhexa.com/893489) which could be a direct reference to people DRSing. Final message suggests it's a hold until further notice, potentially a gamestop announcement who knows?\n\n**8.45am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790725065585439065](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790725065585439065)\n\n**Description:** We have a scene from Ozark where the wife of the money laundering family is alone in her bedroom reflecting to the sound of The Daily Mail by Radiohead. Some Gamestop logos on the wall which i think replace a picture of her family in the original clip. More reflection.\n\n**Speculation:** Not sure about this one other than the family in Ozark were right on the line of legality when it came to what they were doing, essentially they were money laundering and in the end it cost them their family. SHFs messing with Gamestop to the point of legality could be what costs them their family of investors?\n\n**9.00am -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790728848226521547](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790728848226521547)\n\n**Description:** This is a famous scene from Star Wars where Han Solo takes them through the asteroid field despite C3-PO's cry that the odds are so greatly stacked against them, approximately 3720-1 to be exact! \"Never tell me the odds\" says Hans Solo. The Song Come Along by Cosmo Sheldrake comes on as the ship navigates it's way through.\n\n**Speculation:** This play is a high risk play as we all know but DFV doesn't care about the odds, so many people have told him how crazy he is but that doesn't stop him absolutely nailing it. The song has some interesting lyrics to pick a few, \"Don't let moments pass along, And waste before your eyes\", \"We'll be here when the world slows down, And the sunbeams fade away, Keeping time by a pendulum, As the fabric starts to fray\" Full lyrics [here](https://genius.com/Cosmo-sheldrake-come-along-lyrics)\n\n**9.15am -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790732615022195139](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790732615022195139)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from The Chappelle Show \"when keeping it real goes wrong\". In this sketch Kitty replaces a lot of the words to relate to him and the scene ends with Wu-Tang being brought up.\n\n**Speculation:** Really i think this is just DFV having some fun with this sketch, replacing the woofs for meows, it brings up Wu-Tang as well which was a talking point way back in the NFT marketplace chat.\n\n**9.30am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790736391124774975](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790736391124774975)\n\n**Description:** We have a clip of Moon Knight from Fortnite alongside the song Day and Night by Kid Cudi. This is the official fortnite music video.\n\n**Speculation:** The Moon Knight in fortnite is considered a rare character. In fact the last time the Moon Knight was in the fortnite shop was Nov29, 2023. With that, it's a very valuable and sort after skin. Also worth noting about the Moon Knight, \"For a quick run-down: Moon Knight is actually a former mercenary named Marc Spector. One day, when he's left for dead in the desert, the ancient Egyptian moon god Khonsu revives him. Along with a new lease on life, **Khonsu gifts Marc with god-like powers to fight evil\".** Take from that what you will.\n\n**9.45am -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790740164848861227](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790740164848861227)\n\n**Description:** Not 100% sure on the cartoon being shown but the rap is Mr. Niceguy by Will Smith.\n\n**Speculation:** I don't think DFV is liking the public dissing he is getting from various media outlets but really he doesn't care that much as he can just nail some memes he has lined up like this. If you want the full lyrics to the song, you can find it [here](https://genius.com/Will-smith-mr-niceguy-lyrics)\n\n**10am -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790743946764644659](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790743946764644659)\n\n**Description:** This is the epic reveal in fight club and DFV has replaced a lot of the words. In the original scene, if you haven't watched fight club, the main protagonist has put the pieces together to realise that he himself is actually the same person as the other protagonist in the film and it was him alone that accidentally setup a sort of movement against the financial elite. In this clip DFV plays off the two characters between DFV and Roaring Kitty.\n\n**Speculation:** Roaring Kitty was the twitter handle and Youtube profile for Keith Gill where he would speculate on the stock because he just loved doing it. DFV was the reddit handle where he is associated to that other sub i can't mention here but you know where i mean. I think that DFV is saying that what started as a fun speculation of the stock became something bigger than himself with his other channel in DFV on reddit. Now the wheels have moved and in the film it ends with the financial institutions being blown up, perhaps something similar metaphorically is already in place right now. It's actually a great analogy from DFV about his situation.\n\n**10.15am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790747714440892825](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790747714440892825)\n\n**Description:** This is the scene in Breaking Bad where Walter comes clean to his wife Skylar about all the money he has made selling meth. Skylar sees him for who he really is in this scene and really it's the beginning of when Walter begins to really lose himself. There is a funny insert of Methamphetameme and a mention of Caroline who i believe is his wife in real life.\n\n**Speculation:** I think this is just DFV having some fun and giving an idea of how nuts it probably was for him to talk to his wife about everything that has happened/is happening. I know to us DFV seems like some sort of oracle but to many people he would just seem like some of stock bro who is nuts, even his wife.\n\n**10.30am** - [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790751492451754012](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790751492451754012)\n\n**Description:** This is from the oceans 11 film again where the gang are discussing about what they are and how they have come to be. DFV inserts \"the Cohen crunch\" as what everything could be called and also says \"One could make the argument that because it was in fact Cohen joining the board that seemed to kick things off maybe it should be...\". DFV then has a big reveal of the reddit user u/ avocado-in-my-anus.\n\n**Speculation:** Is this all about Ryan Cohen? Is it about DFV? Is it about the Squeeze? Or is it about Avocado in my anus!? - If you follow to that reddit user you will see 3 posts, all on October 29th of each of the last 3 years, all saying Happy Cat Day posted to 3 different subreddits, \"never tell me the odds\", \"next fucking level\" and \"woah dude\". Why is october 29th so significant? See for yourself [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929)\n\n**10.45am -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790755264733626879](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790755264733626879)\n\n**Description:** First we have a clip taken from CNBC where they say \"is Roaring Kitty the one running this company?\". It then cuts to a classic superbad scene of lots of dicks being drawn.\n\n**Speculation:** I would imagine CNBC's angle here is that **in their opinion** Roaring Kitty is the one helping the stock so much with his influence that he might as well be running the company. Judging by the fact we go to a load of dicks after that I don't think DFV agrees with that opinion...\n\n**11am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790759048985612468](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790759048985612468)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from The Avengers Endgame and it's where Peter Quill and Thor are told they should fight one another for the honour of the leadership of the Guardians of the Galaxy. They reply they don't want to go against each other and then there is a little humored ambigurity over who is in charge.\n\n**Speculation:** This could be about DFV and RC. Not 100% which one is which but DFV is saying they are on the same side and respect each other in their view on what is best for Gamestop. DFV conceding he isn't in charge here and sort of plays into the last meme.\n\n**11.15am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790762813868175516](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790762813868175516)\n\n**Description:** This is a scene taken from Love Actually and you will most likely recognize Rick from The Walking Dead. In the original clip he is filming his best friend (and it turns out he actually is in love with his best friends wife in this film). It then cuts to some memes of Ryan Cohen and a clip from his stream about updating thesis regularly.\n\n**Speculation:** I think this is summed up pretty well by u/ starhammer4billion. *\"In 2021, DFV was mad, that R.C. did not push the button/do the buyback and told us clearly that he did not like R.C. anymore with this meme.*  \n*Now in 2024, he rewinds that meme and tells us, that he thought that at the time in 2021, but that the investment thesis evolved over time and he now sees R.C. as a supermodel. So basically he saw what R.C. was doing in 2024, which he did not in 2021 and he likes R.C. again now.*  \n*Probably because R.C. pushed the button and also did some plan with loopholes and stuff that DFV may not have thought about.\"*\n\n**11.30am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790766591526735887](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790766591526735887)\n\n**Description:** Here we have a clip from the music video Gossip Folks by Missy Elliot. Some of the lyrics have been replaced by Roaring Kitty. It tells the story of DFV and then there is a ton of emojis that read 😳💩😿🥜🐸🍦🤢👍👊💀🥸👀🤩⚡️🎮🚀🍄💥🍏🤨😵‍💫💜🫂👌🤝⛺️😼🎯👀🐶🇺🇸🎤👀🔥💥🍻\n\n**Speculation:** DFV is saying this is going to go down again 3 years later after it all went down last time. The emojis i think tell the story so far too and maybe what's to come. I'll try my best to elaborate - it's really tinfoil but why not.\n\n* DFV a bit embarrassed by how much it all took off originally, he was the focus of the world in Jan21 (embarrassed)\n* All went to poo as GME dumped with the cheating tactics of the elite (poo)\n* Sad kitty had to go to court and defend himself just because he was right and liked the stock. (sad kitty)\n* Showed he had absolute nuts by doubling down on the stock again. (nuts)\n* Papa RC posted frog and ice cream just around the time he was announced as chairman, the turnaround well and truly underway (frog and ice cream)\n* Not sure about the sick emoji\n* GME looking good again and making gains later into 21 (thumbs up and fist pump)\n* DFV gets killed off from communicating and stock tanks, bear thesis in full swing about GME (skull)\n* DD research is in full swing over what's happening to the stock and DFV is looking at it like oi oi (invetigating and eyes)\n* DD gets everyone focused again and loving the stock, GME, power to the players and convinced it's going to do great again (star eyes, lightning, game, rocket)\n* GME grows in the dark without revealing it's plan for transformation (mushroom)\n* GME runs big end of 2022, all anticipation about NFT marketplace etc etc (boom)\n* RC buying into apple and people wondering about some sort of partnership (apple)\n* Turns out nothing like that happening as people wait for announcements (straight face)\n* NFT marketplace is a disaster and not what people were hoping for (dizzy face)\n* People start DRSing (purple heart)\n* Love in the community is in full flow again as post after post about DRSing shares (hug)\n* Everything is ok and all agreed on the DD and DRSing, happy to wait it out (ok and handshake)\n* Not sure about tent.\n* DFV comes back (kitty)\n* Sees an opportunity to target the shorts again (target)\n* Looks to Ryan Cohen, former owner of chewy to make a move (eye emoji in original looks to the right, dog emoji)\n* Big announcement (microphone)\n* US market sees this and burns to the ground (US flag and fire)\n* Squeeze happens (boom)\n* Cheers everybody (beers)\n\n**Edit\\*** As pointed out by u/ mmilad [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctc9g2/dfvs\\_tweet\\_yesterday\\_with\\_emojis\\_are\\_all\\_rcs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctc9g2/dfvs_tweet_yesterday_with_emojis_are_all_rcs/) - they emojis do run in a sort of chronological order to a lot of RC's tweets, if you go to his twitter page and scroll through from his first tweet you can begin to tick off the emojis one by one.\n\n**11.45am -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790770363627921776](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790770363627921776)\n\n**Description:** We have a pizza being cut in too more and more slices and dubbed onto the pizza are reddit awards along with DFV's last position update post.\n\n**Speculation:** The amount of awards that were constantly being given to this post got so out of hand i can't even think how many notifications and reddit coins DFV must have got back in the day. Definitely a joke on DFV's part and just a reminder to how funny it was the amount of awards he was getting.\n\n**12pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790774146994966570](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790774146994966570)\n\n**Description:** This clip is taken from Spiderman i think the one where Spiderman goes dark but i can't remember exactly. The music is The Black Swan taken from Swan lake and it cuts to the movie of Swan Lake with Natalie Portman as the Black Swan and Kitty being dubbed on her face as she transforms.\n\n**Speculation:** Black swan events are defined as \"A black swan is **an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected from a situation and that has potentially severe consequences\".** When GME does squeeze, it's going to have severe and brutal consequences for the market.\n\n**12:15pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790777913245421806](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790777913245421806)\n\n**Description:** First we have Snoop Dogg in his music video for Gin and Juice talking about drama in the GME then we cut to Scarlet Envy saying \"is it me, am i the drama\", \"am i the villain?\"\n\n**Speculation:** Just DFV having fun with all the drama that is being caused through GME, through his memes and everything in a fun light hearted DFV meme of way.\n\n**12:30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790781688848450012](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790781688848450012)\n\n**Description:** The first clip is taken from Oceans 12 where Ryan is bring the gang back together for an even bigger heist of casinos. Then we have part of the heist where he is stuck waiting in the dining cabinet and cannot escape until they let him out, then we cut to 2 people talking, \"waiting\", \"for what?\", \"for this\". Finally we cut to Batman, i think in the Dark Knight where the Joker is in the hospital and plans to blow it up.\n\n**Speculation:** Bigger squeeze than last time, band back together, GME holders for the last 3 years could be like the guy in the box just let out in time by DFV, we say \"where the fck you been?\", he has been waiting, waiting for this.\n\n**12.45pm -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790785463118348420](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790785463118348420)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from The Dark Knight rises where Bane states \"it doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan\", \"no one cared who i was until I put on the mask\", \"was getting caught part of your plan?\" \"of course\"\n\n**Speculation:** This is taken online about Bane in this movie, \"Everything that Bane did was never for himself, not really, we find out his real loyalty later and I think that is a big reason why he said who he is wasn’t important. He wasn’t there to impress the masses, he was there to execute a plan, to be the playmaker for a person he cared for. He wasn’t one who liked distractions and the concern over who he was, I took it as he saw as unimportant to what the plan was itself\" DFV doesn't matter, the whole thing is bigger than him now, similar to the fight club tweet reference.\n\n**1pm -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790789242513433071](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790789242513433071)\n\n**Description:** This clip is the big reveal in The Usual Suspects. BIG SPOILER HERE TO THE FILM - The police chief realizes in the film that he has just been completely done by the person who actually committed the crime and he was right there all along in the station . In this clip the drawn sketch of the suspect is replaced with the 'ill do it again' meme.\n\n**Speculation:** The mug has roaring kitty on it so I wonder if this really is DFV noticing a similar pattern to what is happening with the stock as to what happened before and has made that realization that it's time to come back and this is all on again. HF's digging the same hole for themselves.\n\n**1.15pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790793012936851665](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790793012936851665)\n\n**Description:** This is a clip showing Keith Gill and a narrator saying that investors were looking for someone to blame for losing big on Gamestop. Then it cuts to \"shut up bitch\" from The Rock in WWF.\n\n**Speculation:** This is a lol meme and basically DFV saying people invest themselves it's not his problem. People did try to sue him if i remember so it's a bit of a fuck you to them.\n\n**1:30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790796790360363016](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790796790360363016)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from Seinfeld and is about how George goes so far just to zing a guy. DFV replaces some words and makes this about the previous tweet, some more fun on his part.\n\n**Speculation:** The episode i believe this takes place is called \"The Money\" and the episode in which George actually flies out is called \"The Comeback\", jokes aside that's some interesting references...\n\n**1:45pm -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790800562654691686](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790800562654691686)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from the Saturday Night Live sketch 'old friend'. It's about two old friends reconnecting, DFV expertly chooses this and only has to change the last name of the Keith in the sketch.\n\n**Speculation:** Everyone thinks DFV is nuts, i mean the guy is posting a lot of memes and taking away my work mornings trying to understand them. Maybe he just loves memes, who knows?\n\n**2pm -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790804340673789978](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790804340673789978)\n\n**Description:** This is a video of beat saber to the song freaks by timmy trumpet and savage. \"The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war\", \"the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor\", \"where the freaks at?\". Big tune and then the vibing cat makes an appearance.\n\n**Speculation:** Hard to say much about this other than it's a fun song and makes you vibe just like the cat. People are coming to twitter to see his memes and we are all vibing out off of it.\n\n**2.15pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790808112741630320](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790808112741630320)\n\n**Description:** Shows a man being followed around by a man in a suit with a red right hand. I'm not sure what this is taken from but the song is definitely Red Right Hand by Nick Cave and the Bad seeds. For me personally this song is most associated with The Peeky Blinders.\n\n**Speculation:** The man could be anyone short on GME and the man following him making him scared could be DFV or whatever else is going to pound on those shorts. If you want the lyrics to the song then you can find them [here](https://www.nickcave.com/lyric/red-right-hand/)\n\n**2.31pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790812277530034448](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790812277530034448)\n\n**Description:** Shows a bear on a pink recliner with a kitty sneaking in the background.\n\n**Speculation:** This was a direct response to a Jim Cramer tweet who was essentially poking fun at DFV by saying he should make more memes as it's not working on helping GME. Worth noting that this doesn't look like a scheduled tweet and was probably not planned.\n\n**2:45pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790815662203617755](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790815662203617755)\n\n**Description:** Shows Jim Carrey not 100% which movie it is though i recognize it with a red graph overlayed showing the stock price going down. His smile deteriorates but he seems to have some sort of demented plan in a weird way.\n\n**Speculation:** Stock might be going down and that might initially take the smile off but the creepy smile at the end shows that it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, they are going to get it by the end.\n\n**3:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790819440617033914](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790819440617033914)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from the Truman show where Jim Carrey plays a character who's whole life is a television show for everyone else to watch. He is unaware of this but starts to become more aware as the film goes on. This particular clip is where he is trying to get to the edge of the world to see behind the curtain and the director is trying to stop him with lightning strikes and storms and whatever else he can throw.\n\n**Speculation:** They are doing everything they can to keep a lid on GME. Firing as many shots as they can but it's not working. Is this the best they have?\n\n**3.15pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790823211745063394](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790823211745063394)\n\n**Description:** This is a clip from Dunkey's best games of 2017 and here we see a game where it's just boss fight after boss fight and is really fun.\n\n**Speculation:** This is a game for us, they can hammer down the stock and do what they want but GME holders just keep buying more and moving to the next level\n\n**3.30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790826988019528035](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790826988019528035)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from Tenet and is about inverted bullets. It talks about being able to drop bullets and bring bullets back up and move bullets without touching them.\n\n**Speculation:** I certainly don't understand even a little of what is going on with the stock, but you can still have a feel for what is happening with the stock and it feels good right now even with the dip. Could be something to do with inverse hedging but don't know enough about that to speculate.\n\n**3.45pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790830761542664192](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790830761542664192)\n\n**Description:** Firstly we have the Matrix where Neo is about to fight Morpheus and then we have Alice in Wonderland with Alice going down into the rabbit hole. (The rabbit hole is mentioned in the Matrix too when Neo is given the pill option).\n\n**Speculation:** The scene where Neo fights Morpheus is really the first time we start to see Neo believe in his ability to be the chosen one but also understand the power being able to beat the matrix. With the Alice in Wonderland it's about seeing how far the rabbit hole goes, things will get more crazy for sure and we are going to find out just how deep this goes.\n\n**4:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790834536403574936](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790834536403574936)\n\n**Description:** Here we have the music video for Karma police by Radiohead. A man is running from a car at a hobble speed and then stops turns around and there is a trail of fuel heading towards the car that has stopped. He pulls out a box of matches from his back pocket and is just before to set the car alight by dropping a lit match on the fuel.\n\n**Speculation:** Another Radiohead song, you can find the full lyrics [here](https://genius.com/Radiohead-karma-police-lyrics) but to pick a line out \"this is what you get when you mess with us\". Whilst being slowly chased down, there is going to be a flip reverse based on the trail left by the shorts only to blow it all up.\n\n**8:00pm -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790894938277695671](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790894938277695671)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from the Shawshank redemption where the main protagonist has escaped from the prison after being wrongly imprisoned for many years. DFV has changed some of the narrators (Red) words in showcase his story of being wrongly accused in 2021 and having the flee out of the spotlight. He talks about pressure and time, he presents a lot of memes he has created over the years and then shows a particular screenshot of one of his streams.\n\n**Speculation:** This tells DFVs story but also has some juicy parts. I think Red in this is a bit like the reddit crew (us) keeping tabs on his story but DFV is saying to escape like him it takes pressure and time (could be gamma squeeze, could be LEAPS, could be DRS, could be holding and buying, could be ALL of it) but all it takes is time and pressure. The memes he posted i wonder if some of those have found their way into various subs over the last 3 years without any of us knowing it came from DFV. The steam he screenshot has been spoken about a lot this morning but it seems to come from one of his youtube streams when GME last broke $30.\n\nHope you enjoyed these takes.\n\nLove ya DFV",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Apes,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another review of Roaring Kitty tweets, if you wanna check out previous days then links are below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1crq93w/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_a_humble_apes_opinion/\"&gt;13th May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1csixeq/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_14th_may_a_humble/\"&gt;14th May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, the description of each tweet is to the best of my knowledge the references made to allow you to make your own view in context and the speculation is pure speculation on my part, this is just for fun and shouldn&amp;#39;t be taken as any financial advice, make your own decisions, I just like the stock. If you have anything to add feel free to in the comments and I&amp;#39;ll do my best to update the post but given the amount of tweets now i don&amp;#39;t have lots of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:00am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790713748866371690\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790713748866371690&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from the film Easy-A and shows Emma Stone walking through school catching a lot of attention looking fine and what was an A sticker in the original clip has been replaced with the Gamestop play logo. The song is Sexy Silk by Jessie J&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The stock is sexy, particularly among the younger people. What was Easy-A is now Easy-Gamestop. Looking really great in the black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.15am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790717515523658119\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790717515523658119&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First we have a scene from the movie Prestige, with a Michael Caine voiceover about a magicians magic trick of making something disappear. The quote is &amp;quot;The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you&amp;#39;re looking for the secret... but you won&amp;#39;t find it, because of course you&amp;#39;re not really looking. You don&amp;#39;t really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn&amp;#39;t clap yet. Because making something disappear isn&amp;#39;t enough; you have to bring it back.&amp;quot; Meanwhile a person with a gamestop logo is being electrocuted to life a little frankenstein like and then a Gamestop logo bursts through an explosion. We then go to a fight scene with the song &amp;quot;back in the saddle again&amp;quot; by Aerosmith playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The quote from the Prestige in full talks about the different parts of making something disappear. In full &amp;quot; Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called &amp;quot;The Pledge&amp;quot;. The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn&amp;#39;t. The second act is called &amp;quot;The Turn&amp;quot;. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you&amp;#39;re looking for the secret... but you won&amp;#39;t find it, because of course you&amp;#39;re not really looking. You don&amp;#39;t really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn&amp;#39;t clap yet. Because making something disappear isn&amp;#39;t enough; you have to bring it back. That&amp;#39;s why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call &amp;quot;The Prestige&amp;quot;.&amp;quot; The Aerosmith song also has some interesting lyrics, &amp;quot;Ridin&amp;#39; into town alone by the light of the moon&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m ridin&amp;#39;, I&amp;#39;m loadin&amp;#39; up my pistol, I&amp;#39;m ridin&amp;#39;, I really got a fistful, I&amp;#39;m ridin&amp;#39;, I&amp;#39;m shinin&amp;#39; up my saddle, I&amp;#39;m ridin&amp;#39;, this snake is gonna rattle&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.30am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790721293089964126\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790721293089964126&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Not sure what film this is from but essentially we have a group of people looking for someone who is messing with them, they come across the infamous meme of death looking for Gamestop and then they track down Roaring Kitty alongside 893489 CHIMP located in Boston. We then get a message of Prep mode and arm ready for transport, hold pattern until further notice and a message again on a watch saying the same with a Gamestop logo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; WS looking for DFV and just coming across more memes, not really understanding it. As pointed out by many, 893489 is the hexcode for purple &lt;a href=\"https://www.colorhexa.com/893489\"&gt;https://www.colorhexa.com/893489&lt;/a&gt; which could be a direct reference to people DRSing. Final message suggests it&amp;#39;s a hold until further notice, potentially a gamestop announcement who knows?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.45am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790725065585439065\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790725065585439065&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; We have a scene from Ozark where the wife of the money laundering family is alone in her bedroom reflecting to the sound of The Daily Mail by Radiohead. Some Gamestop logos on the wall which i think replace a picture of her family in the original clip. More reflection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Not sure about this one other than the family in Ozark were right on the line of legality when it came to what they were doing, essentially they were money laundering and in the end it cost them their family. SHFs messing with Gamestop to the point of legality could be what costs them their family of investors?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.00am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790728848226521547\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790728848226521547&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a famous scene from Star Wars where Han Solo takes them through the asteroid field despite C3-PO&amp;#39;s cry that the odds are so greatly stacked against them, approximately 3720-1 to be exact! &amp;quot;Never tell me the odds&amp;quot; says Hans Solo. The Song Come Along by Cosmo Sheldrake comes on as the ship navigates it&amp;#39;s way through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This play is a high risk play as we all know but DFV doesn&amp;#39;t care about the odds, so many people have told him how crazy he is but that doesn&amp;#39;t stop him absolutely nailing it. The song has some interesting lyrics to pick a few, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let moments pass along, And waste before your eyes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll be here when the world slows down, And the sunbeams fade away, Keeping time by a pendulum, As the fabric starts to fray&amp;quot; Full lyrics &lt;a href=\"https://genius.com/Cosmo-sheldrake-come-along-lyrics\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.15am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790732615022195139\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790732615022195139&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from The Chappelle Show &amp;quot;when keeping it real goes wrong&amp;quot;. In this sketch Kitty replaces a lot of the words to relate to him and the scene ends with Wu-Tang being brought up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Really i think this is just DFV having some fun with this sketch, replacing the woofs for meows, it brings up Wu-Tang as well which was a talking point way back in the NFT marketplace chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.30am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790736391124774975\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790736391124774975&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; We have a clip of Moon Knight from Fortnite alongside the song Day and Night by Kid Cudi. This is the official fortnite music video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Moon Knight in fortnite is considered a rare character. In fact the last time the Moon Knight was in the fortnite shop was Nov29, 2023. With that, it&amp;#39;s a very valuable and sort after skin. Also worth noting about the Moon Knight, &amp;quot;For a quick run-down: Moon Knight is actually a former mercenary named Marc Spector. One day, when he&amp;#39;s left for dead in the desert, the ancient Egyptian moon god Khonsu revives him. Along with a new lease on life, &lt;strong&gt;Khonsu gifts Marc with god-like powers to fight evil&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; Take from that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.45am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790740164848861227\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790740164848861227&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Not 100% sure on the cartoon being shown but the rap is Mr. Niceguy by Will Smith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t think DFV is liking the public dissing he is getting from various media outlets but really he doesn&amp;#39;t care that much as he can just nail some memes he has lined up like this. If you want the full lyrics to the song, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://genius.com/Will-smith-mr-niceguy-lyrics\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790743946764644659\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790743946764644659&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the epic reveal in fight club and DFV has replaced a lot of the words. In the original scene, if you haven&amp;#39;t watched fight club, the main protagonist has put the pieces together to realise that he himself is actually the same person as the other protagonist in the film and it was him alone that accidentally setup a sort of movement against the financial elite. In this clip DFV plays off the two characters between DFV and Roaring Kitty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Roaring Kitty was the twitter handle and Youtube profile for Keith Gill where he would speculate on the stock because he just loved doing it. DFV was the reddit handle where he is associated to that other sub i can&amp;#39;t mention here but you know where i mean. I think that DFV is saying that what started as a fun speculation of the stock became something bigger than himself with his other channel in DFV on reddit. Now the wheels have moved and in the film it ends with the financial institutions being blown up, perhaps something similar metaphorically is already in place right now. It&amp;#39;s actually a great analogy from DFV about his situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.15am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790747714440892825\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790747714440892825&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the scene in Breaking Bad where Walter comes clean to his wife Skylar about all the money he has made selling meth. Skylar sees him for who he really is in this scene and really it&amp;#39;s the beginning of when Walter begins to really lose himself. There is a funny insert of Methamphetameme and a mention of Caroline who i believe is his wife in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I think this is just DFV having some fun and giving an idea of how nuts it probably was for him to talk to his wife about everything that has happened/is happening. I know to us DFV seems like some sort of oracle but to many people he would just seem like some of stock bro who is nuts, even his wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.30am&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790751492451754012\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790751492451754012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is from the oceans 11 film again where the gang are discussing about what they are and how they have come to be. DFV inserts &amp;quot;the Cohen crunch&amp;quot; as what everything could be called and also says &amp;quot;One could make the argument that because it was in fact Cohen joining the board that seemed to kick things off maybe it should be...&amp;quot;. DFV then has a big reveal of the reddit user u/ avocado-in-my-anus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Is this all about Ryan Cohen? Is it about DFV? Is it about the Squeeze? Or is it about Avocado in my anus!? - If you follow to that reddit user you will see 3 posts, all on October 29th of each of the last 3 years, all saying Happy Cat Day posted to 3 different subreddits, &amp;quot;never tell me the odds&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;next fucking level&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;woah dude&amp;quot;. Why is october 29th so significant? See for yourself &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.45am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790755264733626879\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790755264733626879&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First we have a clip taken from CNBC where they say &amp;quot;is Roaring Kitty the one running this company?&amp;quot;. It then cuts to a classic superbad scene of lots of dicks being drawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I would imagine CNBC&amp;#39;s angle here is that &lt;strong&gt;in their opinion&lt;/strong&gt; Roaring Kitty is the one helping the stock so much with his influence that he might as well be running the company. Judging by the fact we go to a load of dicks after that I don&amp;#39;t think DFV agrees with that opinion...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790759048985612468\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790759048985612468&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from The Avengers Endgame and it&amp;#39;s where Peter Quill and Thor are told they should fight one another for the honour of the leadership of the Guardians of the Galaxy. They reply they don&amp;#39;t want to go against each other and then there is a little humored ambigurity over who is in charge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This could be about DFV and RC. Not 100% which one is which but DFV is saying they are on the same side and respect each other in their view on what is best for Gamestop. DFV conceding he isn&amp;#39;t in charge here and sort of plays into the last meme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.15am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790762813868175516\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790762813868175516&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a scene taken from Love Actually and you will most likely recognize Rick from The Walking Dead. In the original clip he is filming his best friend (and it turns out he actually is in love with his best friends wife in this film). It then cuts to some memes of Ryan Cohen and a clip from his stream about updating thesis regularly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I think this is summed up pretty well by u/ starhammer4billion. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;In 2021, DFV was mad, that R.C. did not push the button/do the buyback and told us clearly that he did not like R.C. anymore with this meme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Now in 2024, he rewinds that meme and tells us, that he thought that at the time in 2021, but that the investment thesis evolved over time and he now sees R.C. as a supermodel. So basically he saw what R.C. was doing in 2024, which he did not in 2021 and he likes R.C. again now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Probably because R.C. pushed the button and also did some plan with loopholes and stuff that DFV may not have thought about.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.30am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790766591526735887\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790766591526735887&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Here we have a clip from the music video Gossip Folks by Missy Elliot. Some of the lyrics have been replaced by Roaring Kitty. It tells the story of DFV and then there is a ton of emojis that read 😳💩😿🥜🐸🍦🤢👍👊💀🥸👀🤩⚡️🎮🚀🍄💥🍏🤨😵‍💫💜🫂👌🤝⛺️😼🎯👀🐶🇺🇸🎤👀🔥💥🍻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; DFV is saying this is going to go down again 3 years later after it all went down last time. The emojis i think tell the story so far too and maybe what&amp;#39;s to come. I&amp;#39;ll try my best to elaborate - it&amp;#39;s really tinfoil but why not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DFV a bit embarrassed by how much it all took off originally, he was the focus of the world in Jan21 (embarrassed)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All went to poo as GME dumped with the cheating tactics of the elite (poo)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sad kitty had to go to court and defend himself just because he was right and liked the stock. (sad kitty)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Showed he had absolute nuts by doubling down on the stock again. (nuts)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Papa RC posted frog and ice cream just around the time he was announced as chairman, the turnaround well and truly underway (frog and ice cream)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not sure about the sick emoji&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GME looking good again and making gains later into 21 (thumbs up and fist pump)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DFV gets killed off from communicating and stock tanks, bear thesis in full swing about GME (skull)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DD research is in full swing over what&amp;#39;s happening to the stock and DFV is looking at it like oi oi (invetigating and eyes)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DD gets everyone focused again and loving the stock, GME, power to the players and convinced it&amp;#39;s going to do great again (star eyes, lightning, game, rocket)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GME grows in the dark without revealing it&amp;#39;s plan for transformation (mushroom)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GME runs big end of 2022, all anticipation about NFT marketplace etc etc (boom)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RC buying into apple and people wondering about some sort of partnership (apple)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Turns out nothing like that happening as people wait for announcements (straight face)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NFT marketplace is a disaster and not what people were hoping for (dizzy face)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People start DRSing (purple heart)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Love in the community is in full flow again as post after post about DRSing shares (hug)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Everything is ok and all agreed on the DD and DRSing, happy to wait it out (ok and handshake)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not sure about tent.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DFV comes back (kitty)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sees an opportunity to target the shorts again (target)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Looks to Ryan Cohen, former owner of chewy to make a move (eye emoji in original looks to the right, dog emoji)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Big announcement (microphone)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;US market sees this and burns to the ground (US flag and fire)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Squeeze happens (boom)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cheers everybody (beers)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit\\&lt;/strong&gt;* As pointed out by u/ mmilad &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctc9g2/dfvs_tweet_yesterday_with_emojis_are_all_rcs/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ctc9g2/dfvs_tweet_yesterday_with_emojis_are_all_rcs/&lt;/a&gt; - they emojis do run in a sort of chronological order to a lot of RC&amp;#39;s tweets, if you go to his twitter page and scroll through from his first tweet you can begin to tick off the emojis one by one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.45am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790770363627921776\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790770363627921776&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; We have a pizza being cut in too more and more slices and dubbed onto the pizza are reddit awards along with DFV&amp;#39;s last position update post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of awards that were constantly being given to this post got so out of hand i can&amp;#39;t even think how many notifications and reddit coins DFV must have got back in the day. Definitely a joke on DFV&amp;#39;s part and just a reminder to how funny it was the amount of awards he was getting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790774146994966570\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790774146994966570&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This clip is taken from Spiderman i think the one where Spiderman goes dark but i can&amp;#39;t remember exactly. The music is The Black Swan taken from Swan lake and it cuts to the movie of Swan Lake with Natalie Portman as the Black Swan and Kitty being dubbed on her face as she transforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Black swan events are defined as &amp;quot;A black swan is &lt;strong&gt;an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected from a situation and that has potentially severe consequences&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; When GME does squeeze, it&amp;#39;s going to have severe and brutal consequences for the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:15pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790777913245421806\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790777913245421806&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First we have Snoop Dogg in his music video for Gin and Juice talking about drama in the GME then we cut to Scarlet Envy saying &amp;quot;is it me, am i the drama&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;am i the villain?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Just DFV having fun with all the drama that is being caused through GME, through his memes and everything in a fun light hearted DFV meme of way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790781688848450012\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790781688848450012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; The first clip is taken from Oceans 12 where Ryan is bring the gang back together for an even bigger heist of casinos. Then we have part of the heist where he is stuck waiting in the dining cabinet and cannot escape until they let him out, then we cut to 2 people talking, &amp;quot;waiting&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;for what?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;for this&amp;quot;. Finally we cut to Batman, i think in the Dark Knight where the Joker is in the hospital and plans to blow it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Bigger squeeze than last time, band back together, GME holders for the last 3 years could be like the guy in the box just let out in time by DFV, we say &amp;quot;where the fck you been?&amp;quot;, he has been waiting, waiting for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.45pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790785463118348420\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790785463118348420&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from The Dark Knight rises where Bane states &amp;quot;it doesn&amp;#39;t matter who we are, what matters is our plan&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;no one cared who i was until I put on the mask&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;was getting caught part of your plan?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;of course&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken online about Bane in this movie, &amp;quot;Everything that Bane did was never for himself, not really, we find out his real loyalty later and I think that is a big reason why he said who he is wasn’t important. He wasn’t there to impress the masses, he was there to execute a plan, to be the playmaker for a person he cared for. He wasn’t one who liked distractions and the concern over who he was, I took it as he saw as unimportant to what the plan was itself&amp;quot; DFV doesn&amp;#39;t matter, the whole thing is bigger than him now, similar to the fight club tweet reference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790789242513433071\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790789242513433071&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This clip is the big reveal in The Usual Suspects. BIG SPOILER HERE TO THE FILM - The police chief realizes in the film that he has just been completely done by the person who actually committed the crime and he was right there all along in the station . In this clip the drawn sketch of the suspect is replaced with the &amp;#39;ill do it again&amp;#39; meme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The mug has roaring kitty on it so I wonder if this really is DFV noticing a similar pattern to what is happening with the stock as to what happened before and has made that realization that it&amp;#39;s time to come back and this is all on again. HF&amp;#39;s digging the same hole for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.15pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790793012936851665\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790793012936851665&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a clip showing Keith Gill and a narrator saying that investors were looking for someone to blame for losing big on Gamestop. Then it cuts to &amp;quot;shut up bitch&amp;quot; from The Rock in WWF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a lol meme and basically DFV saying people invest themselves it&amp;#39;s not his problem. People did try to sue him if i remember so it&amp;#39;s a bit of a fuck you to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790796790360363016\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790796790360363016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from Seinfeld and is about how George goes so far just to zing a guy. DFV replaces some words and makes this about the previous tweet, some more fun on his part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The episode i believe this takes place is called &amp;quot;The Money&amp;quot; and the episode in which George actually flies out is called &amp;quot;The Comeback&amp;quot;, jokes aside that&amp;#39;s some interesting references...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:45pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790800562654691686\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790800562654691686&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from the Saturday Night Live sketch &amp;#39;old friend&amp;#39;. It&amp;#39;s about two old friends reconnecting, DFV expertly chooses this and only has to change the last name of the Keith in the sketch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone thinks DFV is nuts, i mean the guy is posting a lot of memes and taking away my work mornings trying to understand them. Maybe he just loves memes, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790804340673789978\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790804340673789978&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a video of beat saber to the song freaks by timmy trumpet and savage. &amp;quot;The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;where the freaks at?&amp;quot;. Big tune and then the vibing cat makes an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Hard to say much about this other than it&amp;#39;s a fun song and makes you vibe just like the cat. People are coming to twitter to see his memes and we are all vibing out off of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.15pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790808112741630320\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790808112741630320&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Shows a man being followed around by a man in a suit with a red right hand. I&amp;#39;m not sure what this is taken from but the song is definitely Red Right Hand by Nick Cave and the Bad seeds. For me personally this song is most associated with The Peeky Blinders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The man could be anyone short on GME and the man following him making him scared could be DFV or whatever else is going to pound on those shorts. If you want the lyrics to the song then you can find them &lt;a href=\"https://www.nickcave.com/lyric/red-right-hand/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.31pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790812277530034448\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790812277530034448&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Shows a bear on a pink recliner with a kitty sneaking in the background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This was a direct response to a Jim Cramer tweet who was essentially poking fun at DFV by saying he should make more memes as it&amp;#39;s not working on helping GME. Worth noting that this doesn&amp;#39;t look like a scheduled tweet and was probably not planned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:45pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790815662203617755\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790815662203617755&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Shows Jim Carrey not 100% which movie it is though i recognize it with a red graph overlayed showing the stock price going down. His smile deteriorates but he seems to have some sort of demented plan in a weird way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Stock might be going down and that might initially take the smile off but the creepy smile at the end shows that it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter in the grand scheme of things, they are going to get it by the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790819440617033914\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790819440617033914&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from the Truman show where Jim Carrey plays a character who&amp;#39;s whole life is a television show for everyone else to watch. He is unaware of this but starts to become more aware as the film goes on. This particular clip is where he is trying to get to the edge of the world to see behind the curtain and the director is trying to stop him with lightning strikes and storms and whatever else he can throw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; They are doing everything they can to keep a lid on GME. Firing as many shots as they can but it&amp;#39;s not working. Is this the best they have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.15pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790823211745063394\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790823211745063394&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a clip from Dunkey&amp;#39;s best games of 2017 and here we see a game where it&amp;#39;s just boss fight after boss fight and is really fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a game for us, they can hammer down the stock and do what they want but GME holders just keep buying more and moving to the next level&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790826988019528035\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790826988019528035&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from Tenet and is about inverted bullets. It talks about being able to drop bullets and bring bullets back up and move bullets without touching them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I certainly don&amp;#39;t understand even a little of what is going on with the stock, but you can still have a feel for what is happening with the stock and it feels good right now even with the dip. Could be something to do with inverse hedging but don&amp;#39;t know enough about that to speculate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.45pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790830761542664192\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790830761542664192&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Firstly we have the Matrix where Neo is about to fight Morpheus and then we have Alice in Wonderland with Alice going down into the rabbit hole. (The rabbit hole is mentioned in the Matrix too when Neo is given the pill option).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The scene where Neo fights Morpheus is really the first time we start to see Neo believe in his ability to be the chosen one but also understand the power being able to beat the matrix. With the Alice in Wonderland it&amp;#39;s about seeing how far the rabbit hole goes, things will get more crazy for sure and we are going to find out just how deep this goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790834536403574936\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790834536403574936&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Here we have the music video for Karma police by Radiohead. A man is running from a car at a hobble speed and then stops turns around and there is a trail of fuel heading towards the car that has stopped. He pulls out a box of matches from his back pocket and is just before to set the car alight by dropping a lit match on the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Another Radiohead song, you can find the full lyrics &lt;a href=\"https://genius.com/Radiohead-karma-police-lyrics\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but to pick a line out &amp;quot;this is what you get when you mess with us&amp;quot;. Whilst being slowly chased down, there is going to be a flip reverse based on the trail left by the shorts only to blow it all up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790894938277695671\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790894938277695671&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; This is taken from the Shawshank redemption where the main protagonist has escaped from the prison after being wrongly imprisoned for many years. DFV has changed some of the narrators (Red) words in showcase his story of being wrongly accused in 2021 and having the flee out of the spotlight. He talks about pressure and time, he presents a lot of memes he has created over the years and then shows a particular screenshot of one of his streams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; This tells DFVs story but also has some juicy parts. I think Red in this is a bit like the reddit crew (us) keeping tabs on his story but DFV is saying to escape like him it takes pressure and time (could be gamma squeeze, could be LEAPS, could be DRS, could be holding and buying, could be ALL of it) but all it takes is time and pressure. The memes he posted i wonder if some of those have found their way into various subs over the last 3 years without any of us knowing it came from DFV. The steam he screenshot has been spoken about a lot this morning but it seems to come from one of his youtube streams when GME last broke $30.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed these takes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love ya DFV&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "Hello Apes.\n\nBack with another review of all the tweets sent from memelord and cat inspiration, Roaring Kitty.\n\nIf you missed my first review for 13th May, you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1crq93w/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_a_humble_apes_opinion/).\n\nTo reiterate, the description of each tweet is to the best of my knowledge the references made and the speculation is pure speculation on my part, this is just for fun and shouldn't be taken as any financial advice, make your own decisions, I just like the stock. If you have anything to add feel free to in the comments and I'll do my best to update the post.\n\n**11am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790396654971224430](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790396654971224430)\n\n**Description:** The infamous scene from the movie Troy where Achilles rather reluctantly at first, comes forward to fight the mighty Boagrius. Achilles runs at him, defending against a few spear throws then with one epic jump and slide, stabs Boagrius with this blade killing him in one clean strike. The music dubbed on this clip is Counting Bodies Like Sheep To The Rhythm of the War Drums by A Perfect Circle.\n\n**Speculation:** Chosen warrior blessed by the gods comes forward in front of the masses and takes out the big baddie. You could make the speculation that the song could reference something to do with DRS (A Perfect Circle) and SHFs bleeding out (counting bodies like sheep).\n\n**11.30am -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790404203715887238](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790404203715887238)\n\n**Description:** First of all we have a cat talking to itself in the mirror stating the words, \"Don't be the bigger person today, be the person that helps them understand that sometimes when you f\\*\\*k around, we find out...\". We then cut to arrested development where Buster who is portrayed as a bear has something to say, \"i wanna shoot down everything you say, so i feel good about myself. cause i'm an uptight \\[insert copious amounts of swearing\\].\n\n**Speculation:** First part DFV knows they (Shorts) have messed around again and have been doing it dirty. The gig is up again, time to close and pay up. The second part is a funny scene from arrested development where Buster, a character who just cannot fit in properly goes AWAL to try and show he has a nasty side, it just comes across as way too far. DFV just poking fun at bears here no doubt.\n\n**12:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790411757120561628](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790411757120561628)\n\n**Description:** First we have a scene from The Town where Doug says to James, \"I need your help. I can't tell you what it is, you can never ask me about it later, and we're gonna hurt some people.\" and James replies, \"Who's car are we going to take?\" Then it cuts to Mad Max where there are a load of sand buggy cars going nuts with flame throwers and all sorts of chaos with the song Du Hast by Rammstein playing in the background.\n\n**Speculation:** I haven't seen the Town but from reading online this scene showed the amazing friendship between Doug and James when James simply replies, who's car are we going to take? in response to what sounds like a risky ask for help from Doug. Then with Mad Max: Fury Road  we have a film about a post apocalyptic survivor in Max Rockatansky who eventually brings down a warlords Citadel (hmmm).\n\n**12:30pm -**  [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790419301976903884](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790419301976903884)\n\n**Description:** First we have the whistling of Omar from The Wire, then we have a scene from the Kingsmen where they are locked in a pub with Galahad and the quote \"Manners maketh man\" and finally we have a scene from Oldboy with a big fight scene cut alongside some anime which is from demon slayer\n\n**Speculation:** The whistling is synonymous with Omar and is to the tune of a nursery rhyme, \"the farmer in the dell\", anyone that watched The Wire would know instantly that this means Omar is coming and this means you best get out the way as he is coming with his double-barreled shotgun and he certainly won't hesitate to use it. The Kingsmen scene where they are locked in the pub is a particularly violent scene and it's an interesting film to reference, the plot \\*Film spoiler here\\* is essentially about a boy named Eggsy from a lower-class neighbourhood who's father dies and he finds out that his father was part of an elite inner circle of upper class. After trying to be part of this group, Eggsy discovers their secret plot to take over the world and takes it into his own hands to save the day. u/ ThePhenomNoku talks about the last 2 referenced films; *\"So the anime is demon slayer. It’s about a kid who has everything taken from him and trains to learn how to fight demons. Though as a sidenote he kind of carries one around with him. It’s complicated.The other movie with the guy holding the person, &amp; the fight scene is the original Oldboy, and without giving too much of the plot away it’s about a dude who is falsely imprisoned for a couple of years or so, and then enacts his revenge.\"*\n\n**Edit\\*** As u/ omegs points out: *whistle is \"The farmer in the dell, Hi-ho, the derry-o\" reference to the circle. The movie Kingsmens: The Golden Circle as well*\n\n**1:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790426851409817615](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790426851409817615)\n\n**Description:** Firstly we have the scene from Oceans 11 where Danny Ocean is chatting to Rusty Ryan right in the initial stage of their plan to heist the casino. He talks about how it's never been done before, will need planning and a large crew and Ryan asks if they are going to use guns, he replies \"not exactly, there's lots of security\" and finally Ryan asks \"what's the target?\". We then cut to a film i'm not aware (anyone help here?) of where an older gentleman shows a calculator to a young woman and the calculator says \"Just up\" on it then the woman says \"yes that looks correct\"\n\n**Speculation:** In Oceans 11 there was a lot of planning and variables that had to happen for everything to work. It was a high risk high reward plan with a lot set up to go against but it's possible. The target has always been \"just up\", DFV just reiterating what he said in the first place.\n\n**1:30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790434400494116873](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790434400494116873)\n\n**Description:** First we have a scene from Old School where he states, \"A loophole?\" \"Yes. Well, it's interesting, sir. As stupid as they appear, they're actually very good at paperwork. It's quite an anomaly.\" then it cuts to a scene from the same film with the C&amp;C factory everybody dance now song and a cheerleading dance attempt\n\n**Speculation:** Of course with the loophole stuff it could be about all of the DD that has been done on what has gone on over the years but it could equally be about SHFs finding loopholes to get out of the mess they are in with the stock. The second part the judges clearly don't feel the attempt of the cheerleading or gymnastics piece they are portraying is any good but they are giving it a go and it's suppose to a comedy. Note the school is the cougars, cat links again of course.\n\n**Edit\\*** As u/ omegs points out: *Loophole is reference to circle. Notice how the mascot is similar to a cat that does backflips into the center of the circle*\n\n**2:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790441953659687421](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790441953659687421)\n\n**Description:** The first part is taken from The Batman and has Batman's monologue running and when the Batman signal is fired into the sky, a kitty shadow is shown instead of the Batman logo. It ends with an emphasis on \"Fear is a Tool\".\n\n**Speculation:** Batman was of course a good hero who would rid the streets of criminals, they would scare just at the sight of the batman signal being fired knowing that they were about to get wrecked. In this clip, two years has been replaced with three years in the monologue and the kitty signal is of course a nice touch.\n\n**2:30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790449499506192405](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790449499506192405)\n\n**Description:** This clip is taken from Mr Robot and is where Elliot plays eXit, a text based computer game that requires him to answer a series of questions in a text based game.\n\n**Speculation:** I think it's best just to give the description of what happens in this scene taken from the fandom page. *Elliot chooses to sit down with the friend in the dungeon. He lights a match and reads the note \"Don't leave me here.\" Elliot chooses to stay. The alarm shuts off. An explosion happens nearby. Robot opens the door to find a fire raging outside. He concludes it's too late. Both of them sit down. They each say \"I love you.\" Explosions rage around the room. \"It's an exciting time in the world,\" Elliot says. Fade to red.* Take from that what you will.\n\n**3:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790457051115847720](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790457051115847720)\n\n**Description:** This scene is taken from the movie Scream (2022), a direct sequel to Scream 4. A lot of the text has been changed but to summarize, one person states \"he is making a requel\" then there is some talk about the squeeze movie that came out last year and how most people in the actual know hated it and how \"squeeze mid\" pissed on their \"covidhood\", how the main character is a mary sue? Then a few cuts of Scream and how real squeeze movies have meta slasher whodunnits and that to some people the original is their favorite thing in the world\n\n**Speculation:** A requel is **A movie which revisits the subject matter of an earlier film but is not a remake or a linear continuation of its plot** (i.e. a sequel or prequel). So essentially what is happening right now with the stock is not exactly the same of what has happened before but it is essentially a revisit of the same subject regarding squeezes. A mid squeeze implies that it wasn't as high as the squeeze could have gone and the theme of slashers and murdered people really suggests heads will roll (SHFs hopefully).\n\n**3:30pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790464599575167004](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790464599575167004)\n\n**Description:** This is a scene from Candyman where he has come for the woman. There is some cat flashes and images going on and the Woman in this is tagged as a bear (that is someone who is down on a stock or market, usually would short). Candyman talks about how there is no need for the bear to leave yet and that he was obliged to come then he says \"be my victim\" and a bumble bee comes out of the word be.\n\n**Speculation:** Time is running out for the bear, they can hang around for a while longer but they will be the victim. This is more of the DFV is coming for you as he dresses himself up as a rampaging murderer targeting the bear in this case. Not sure on the bee, whether that is DFV just having some fun or if it's that a sting is coming in some sense.\n\n**4:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790472153470759217](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790472153470759217)\n\n**Description:** Taken from No Country for Old Men, Carson states he is a day trader and that Anton doesn't have to do this (Anton is going to kill him) tell him he could just go home. Carson continues that Anton could have 14 grand out of an ATM and just walk away before finally stating \"do you have any idea how crazy you are?\". Anton replies, \"you mean the nature of these memes?\" to which Carson says \"I mean the nature of you!\" The scene ends with the phone ringing.\n\n**Speculation:** DFV putting himself into the mode of Anton from No Country for Old Men is quite the statement. For those who haven't seen this movie, Anton is a wrecking ball of a killer and adheres by his rulebook to seek out different people through the movie to take out. Carson being the desperate short seller here who is not understanding why DFV isn't just playing by the usual financial rules and taking his gains and going. The phone ringing at end could be an implication of margin calls ringing for the desperate short seller.\n\n**Edit\\*** As u/ omegs points out: *I think the ATM might be a double meaning \"At The Money\"*\n\n**8:00pm -** [https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790532552828289526](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790532552828289526)\n\n**Description:** This is taken from Braveheart and the prisoner (William Wallace) is asked to say a word in a famous scene where WW shouts \"FREEEEDOM\" only in this clip its \"GAMESTOOOOOOOP\".\n\n**Speculation:** This is the first direct reference to Gamestop word for word and it should be noted that this is the scene where William Wallace is about to be executed. Could mean that DFV is willing to risk it all for Gamestop like William Wallace martyring himself for the freedom of Scotland.\n\nHope you enjoyed.\n\nLove ya DFV",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Apes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back with another review of all the tweets sent from memelord and cat inspiration, Roaring Kitty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you missed my first review for 13th May, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1crq93w/roaring_kitty_tweet_roundup_a_humble_apes_opinion/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, the description of each tweet is to the best of my knowledge the references made and the speculation is pure speculation on my part, this is just for fun and shouldn&amp;#39;t be taken as any financial advice, make your own decisions, I just like the stock. If you have anything to add feel free to in the comments and I&amp;#39;ll do my best to update the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790396654971224430\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790396654971224430&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; The infamous scene from the movie Troy where Achilles rather reluctantly at first, comes forward to fight the mighty Boagrius. Achilles runs at him, defending against a few spear throws then with one epic jump and slide, stabs Boagrius with this blade killing him in one clean strike. The music dubbed on this clip is Counting Bodies Like Sheep To The Rhythm of the War Drums by A Perfect Circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Chosen warrior blessed by the gods comes forward in front of the masses and takes out the big baddie. You could make the speculation that the song could reference something to do with DRS (A Perfect Circle) and SHFs bleeding out (counting bodies like sheep).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.30am -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790404203715887238\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790404203715887238&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First of all we have a cat talking to itself in the mirror stating the words, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be the bigger person today, be the person that helps them understand that sometimes when you f**k around, we find out...&amp;quot;. We then cut to arrested development where Buster who is portrayed as a bear has something to say, &amp;quot;i wanna shoot down everything you say, so i feel good about myself. cause i&amp;#39;m an uptight [insert copious amounts of swearing].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; First part DFV knows they (Shorts) have messed around again and have been doing it dirty. The gig is up again, time to close and pay up. The second part is a funny scene from arrested development where Buster, a character who just cannot fit in properly goes AWAL to try and show he has a nasty side, it just comes across as way too far. DFV just poking fun at bears here no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790411757120561628\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790411757120561628&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First we have a scene from The Town where Doug says to James, &amp;quot;I need your help. I can&amp;#39;t tell you what it is, you can never ask me about it later, and we&amp;#39;re gonna hurt some people.&amp;quot; and James replies, &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s car are we going to take?&amp;quot; Then it cuts to Mad Max where there are a load of sand buggy cars going nuts with flame throwers and all sorts of chaos with the song Du Hast by Rammstein playing in the background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; I haven&amp;#39;t seen the Town but from reading online this scene showed the amazing friendship between Doug and James when James simply replies, who&amp;#39;s car are we going to take? in response to what sounds like a risky ask for help from Doug. Then with Mad Max: Fury Road  we have a film about a post apocalyptic survivor in Max Rockatansky who eventually brings down a warlords Citadel (hmmm).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:30pm -&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790419301976903884\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790419301976903884&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First we have the whistling of Omar from The Wire, then we have a scene from the Kingsmen where they are locked in a pub with Galahad and the quote &amp;quot;Manners maketh man&amp;quot; and finally we have a scene from Oldboy with a big fight scene cut alongside some anime which is from demon slayer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The whistling is synonymous with Omar and is to the tune of a nursery rhyme, &amp;quot;the farmer in the dell&amp;quot;, anyone that watched The Wire would know instantly that this means Omar is coming and this means you best get out the way as he is coming with his double-barreled shotgun and he certainly won&amp;#39;t hesitate to use it. The Kingsmen scene where they are locked in the pub is a particularly violent scene and it&amp;#39;s an interesting film to reference, the plot *Film spoiler here* is essentially about a boy named Eggsy from a lower-class neighbourhood who&amp;#39;s father dies and he finds out that his father was part of an elite inner circle of upper class. After trying to be part of this group, Eggsy discovers their secret plot to take over the world and takes it into his own hands to save the day. u/ ThePhenomNoku talks about the last 2 referenced films; &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;So the anime is demon slayer. It’s about a kid who has everything taken from him and trains to learn how to fight demons. Though as a sidenote he kind of carries one around with him. It’s complicated.The other movie with the guy holding the person, &amp;amp; the fight scene is the original Oldboy, and without giving too much of the plot away it’s about a dude who is falsely imprisoned for a couple of years or so, and then enacts his revenge.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit\\&lt;/strong&gt;* As u/ omegs points out: &lt;em&gt;whistle is &amp;quot;The farmer in the dell, Hi-ho, the derry-o&amp;quot; reference to the circle. The movie Kingsmens: The Golden Circle as well&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790426851409817615\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790426851409817615&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Firstly we have the scene from Oceans 11 where Danny Ocean is chatting to Rusty Ryan right in the initial stage of their plan to heist the casino. He talks about how it&amp;#39;s never been done before, will need planning and a large crew and Ryan asks if they are going to use guns, he replies &amp;quot;not exactly, there&amp;#39;s lots of security&amp;quot; and finally Ryan asks &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the target?&amp;quot;. We then cut to a film i&amp;#39;m not aware (anyone help here?) of where an older gentleman shows a calculator to a young woman and the calculator says &amp;quot;Just up&amp;quot; on it then the woman says &amp;quot;yes that looks correct&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; In Oceans 11 there was a lot of planning and variables that had to happen for everything to work. It was a high risk high reward plan with a lot set up to go against but it&amp;#39;s possible. The target has always been &amp;quot;just up&amp;quot;, DFV just reiterating what he said in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790434400494116873\"&gt;https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790434400494116873&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First we have a scene from Old School where he states, &amp;quot;A loophole?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yes.

    "body": "Hello Apes.\n\nLong time holder and sleeper over the last few years, just quietly holding and buying after believing in the DD of previous much more intelligent apes than I, no more so than the absolute chad who kicked this all off, DFV.\n\nAlthough I should be working right now, I wanted to round up all of the tweets from yesterday and understand the messages behind what was being tweeted. It seems to me that although DFV has to be cryptic with his memes, he has had so long to line this up that there must be intentional messaging behind the tweets too.\n\nThis is pure speculation on my part and i've tried to go through the original tweet posts on here and pick up on anything in the comments that others might have picked up on.\n\n**11am -** [**https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790034263603139012**](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790034263603139012)\n\n**Description:** I'm not a massive Marvel watcher so maybe people can help me expand but the Thanos scene is taken from the ending credits of Scene of Age of Ultron where he has the infinity gauntlet in his hand saying \"Fine, Ill do it myself\" and the Wolverine scene is taken from X-Men origins where Wolverine is brought back to life and in remembering previous life events, went into a full on rage taking out everybody.\n\n**Edit\\*** As u/ friendofricks pointed out in the comments: *Some additional info on the background noises of the Thanos tweet. Someone pointed out that the music and the background tapping were from Inglorious Bastards when the Bear J has the baseball bat and hits the not- see in the head. The second background with the audience cheering is from an audience reaction to Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers when Gandalf rides in to save the Battle of Helms Deep.*\n\n**Speculation:** The first tweet of the market day and a real statement of intent from DFV. Announcing to the world that he is truly back and he is still in. Lots of speculation about whether he would post a YOLO after hours (he did not) but certainly a statement of intent.\n\n**11.30am -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790041813379850491**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790041813379850491)\n\n**Description:** First part is the final scene of Ferris Bueller's Day Off I believe after the credits roll breaking the 3rd wall to ask why you are still here. Next we have Breaking Bad and this is where Saul wants out of the operation as it's becoming high risk but Walter tells him that they are done when he says they are done. Then we have a cat waking from a slumber with the Radiohead song Exit Music (for a film) playing and finally we have the beginning piano music to 'Light of the Seven' from Game of Thrones.\n\n**Speculation:** I believe the first part is a joke that a lot of people have probably asked you over the years and will certainly ask you over the coming days, \"oh are you still holding that GME stock?\", \"why are you still doing that?\" but it could also be directed towards DFV as well from SHFs, why are you still here? (what's an exit strategy huh?). The Breaking Bad reference is an excellent rebuttal to that, \"we're done, when i say we're done\" (SHF's are fk). The Cat waking slowly can describe DFV slowly waking from his slumber, remember his last tweet to sign off years ago of a Cat going to sleep? The song has some interesting lyrics which i won't post in full but you can see for yourself here [Here](https://genius.com/Radiohead-exit-music-for-a-film-lyrics). Just to pick a few lines out; \"Today we escape\", \"Breathe, keep breathing, Don't lose your nerve\", \"I can't do this alone\". The final part is probably my favorite scene from GoT, Cersei's plan comes to full fruition with sweet revenge when she blows up the temple of a cult that had embarassed her beforehand and threatened her rule. She makes them pay with a giant green explosion so take from that what you will. If you want to check out the scene you can find it [here](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x75rmyzhttps://www.dailymotion.com/video/x75rmyz).\n\n**Edit\\*** As pointed out by u/ omegs *\"Exit music was also used in a black mirror episode, Shut up and Dance. For anyone that has watched Black Mirror this is one of the most famous episodes where a boy named Kenny is caught masturbating on camera (i.e with his pants down) to a video of a child and is blackmailed throughout the whole episode doing crazier stuff as it goes along only to still have the video of him released for the world to see\"*\n\n**12pm -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790049362846117942**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790049362846117942)\n\n**Description:** First we have V for Vendetta with \"first the overture\". Next we have a person driving in reverse from Ready Player One and then we have another scene from GoT where Daenerys (The Mother of Dragons) is facing confrontation from a murderous clan who are fighting against her claim over their city and her dragon waking up.\n\n**Speculation:** The overture is an orchestral piece at the beginning of an opera and generally means an introduction to something more substantial, no need to expand further on that. I haven't seen Ready Player One but from looking at comments in other posts: The Ready Player One scene, he wins the race by beating the system. The GoT scene was the waking up Drogon to come to the aid of The Mother of Dragons while a group attempted to assassinate her, all looked lost until Drogon rode in to save the day. I tried to find the episode the check back but I'm pretty sure the actual dragon waking up scene is taken from an episode further into GME where the Dragon originally has blue eyes so I think that clip has been changed to include red eyes (GME red button anyone?)\n\n**Edit\\*** As pointed out in the comments by MrsDuckyJonez, *\"He did another Ready Player One scene years ago and it was the scene right before this one. It was really important because she tells him that he saw something that no one else saw- that in order to win (beat the system) he had to go backwards instead of racing for the finish line. The speculation back then when he posted it was that going back and looking at puts/calls was evidence that hedgies are fukd\".****\\****\n\n**12:30pm -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790056912664601031**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790056912664601031)\n\n**Description:** Firstly, this is taken from Gangs of New York where Amsterdam's father is giving his son a shaving knife and stating \"the blood stays on the blade\" building up to a confrontation with Bill where he will eventually kill him with it. Then we go to the scene just before that happens but everyone has their faces painted in green. Finally we have the music video for Ludacris - Stand Up.\n\n**Speculation:** I haven't seen Gangs of New York but from doing some research online about the significance of the hunting blade i came across this:\n\n&gt;The shaving knife is symbolic.\n\n&gt;\"The blood stays on the blade\" can be interpreted as \"you can't wash away your sins.\"\n\n&gt;One of the major themes of the film is that history repeats itself if we don't learn from its lessons.\n\nSeems like a pretty simple message that SHFs haven't learnt their lessons and history is repeating itself right now, sign of things to come perhaps? Then we have Stand up, DFV having some fun here but the lyrics again have some interesting lines, \"Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless\", \"What's wrong? The club and the moon is full\", \"One sure shot way to get 'em outta them pants\". You can find the full lyrics [Here](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ludacris/standup.html)\n\n**1pm -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790064464357724451**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790064464357724451)\n\n**Description:** Some car scenes here: Firstly we have a car driving off into the sunset taken from the Wiz Khalifa - See you Again music video (part of the Furious 7 soundtrack), then we have a car chase with a car pulling off a highway (not sure where this is from or if its a highway (i'm a UK ape) and finally we have another car chase but this one the driver has beaten the police cars and is pulling up.\n\n**Speculation:** I like the take from u/ tajwriggly here where it could be that DFV is saying everyone thought he was driving off into the sunset for the life of ease... and who could blame him if he was? But no... he's right off the path and in the thick of things with the rest of us. I think all 3 scenes put together tell a short story, DFV seemingly riding off, then DFV giving it the big turn in a big chase and then DFV giving it the slip in his zen like state.\n\n**1.30pm -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790072011810812231**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790072011810812231)\n\n**Description:** First scene shows a woman on the verge of being beheaded before being spared at the last minute then we cut to a scene with 'Ain't no mountain high enough' coming in then finally Florence &amp; the Machine with Dog Days Are Over.\n\n**Speculation:** GME is going to run, there ain't no mountain high enough that's going to stop what this can reach and the DOG days are over, it's the days of the cat now.\n\n**2:00pm -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790079562866360327**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790079562866360327)\n\n**Description:** A beautiful cut scene of the avengers initiative charging as a team to save the world. All kinds of superheroes big and small.\n\n**Speculation:** Whilst we are all individual investors we all do share in one common interest, we love the stock. There could be a case here for basket theory but I won't speculate on that further as I'm personally only interested in one stock but take from that what you will.\n\n**2:30pm -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790087112282239085**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790087112282239085)\n\n**Description:** The first scene is taken from the final duel in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly only some crowd cheering has been dubbed into the background. Then we have Thor coming down hard to smash everyone.\n\n**Speculation:** There is a nervy standoff happening maybe between different short positions, who is going to blink first and close up knowing that making a move means bloodshed only...it doesn't matter because they are all going to get absolutely smashed anyway by the supreme hammer of Thor.\n\n**Edit\\*** As u/ JackTheBehemothKillr pointed out in the comments: *The Good The Bad The Ugly song is from the Metallica S&amp;M album, first song is Ecstasy of Gold from the movie. Transitions into Enter Sandman from the same album.*\n\n&gt;\n\n*Is the first verse. Rest follows along with what DFV has been saying*\n\n*Edit: \"Take my hand, off to neverneverland\"*\n\n*Edit edit: Metallica has opened every concert with that same song since the early 80s*\n\n**3:00pm -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790094668237259040**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790094668237259040)\n\n**Description:** First scene, \"make no mistake it's not revenge he is after it's a reckoning\", then we have a shotgun wielding man \"you tell him i'm coming, and hells coming with me you hear?\" and finally we have Narco with some baddass horse riders taking shots.\n\n**Speculation: A**s **u/ strikeeagle** points out, the Narco trumpets are synonymous with Mets fans as they bring in Edwin Diaz \"Narco\" to close up, usually when it's \"Game over\" for the opposing team. The reckoning is coming! Oh and Steve Cohen owns the Mets of course, trading is a tough game don't ya think?\n\n**3:30pm -** [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790102212619669909](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790102212619669909)\n\n**Description:** Pirates of the Caribbean scene where Captain Barbossa asks what has become of his precious and infamous ship, The Black Pearl. Then we have Men in Black where they press the red button and jet off.\n\n**Speculation:** The captain is back to take back the ship and he is pressing the red button to send this into the stratosphere.\n\n**4:00pm -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790109766389477525**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790109766389477525)\n\n**Description:** Peeky blinders, Tommy Shelby, leader of the Shelby crew is prepping his family to be on their best behaviour just before they fleece a load of the elite at the races then we have another Peeky Blinders scene in which Tommy has another plan up his sleeve but in the end keeps it simple to achieve their goals for revenge.\n\n**Speculation:** DFV has a plan and all that is required from GME loving people is just to keep your plums in order and enjoy the ride, don't make it more complicated than it needs to be, everything is already happening.\n\n**Edit:** Sorry i missed one (i was in bed by this time 1am in UK)\n\n**8pm: -** [**https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790170162265460831**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790170162265460831)\n\n**Description:** The scene from Snatch where the Gypsy takes revenge on the gang that killed his mother after a continuing conflict throughout the film by taking to them with shotguns then we have the music video of BANG! by AJR and finally the Glengarry Glen Ross speech by Alec Baldwin with \"oh, have i got your attention now?\"\n\n**Speculation:** Along the common theme here, Snatch is showing a big revenge with lots of shots fired and this is continued with lots more BANGS directed from Roaring Kitty. Finally the most interesting part of the video in my opinion, quoting the Glengarry Glen Ross Speech, I recommend you give it watch here but if you don't have time, ABC (ALWAYS BE CLOSING), **YOU CLOSE OR YOU HIT THE BRICKS.** Full scene [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQPY4LlbJ4).\n\nLet me know if you have anything to add below and hope you found this helpful. I really should do some work now.\n\nBuy - Hodl - DRS\n\nLove ya DFV x",

There could be a case here for basket theory but I won&amp;#39;t speculate on that further as I&amp;#39;m personally only interested in one stock but take from that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790087112282239085\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790087112282239085&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; The first scene is taken from the final duel in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly only some crowd cheering has been dubbed into the background. Then we have Thor coming down hard to smash everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a nervy standoff happening maybe between different short positions, who is going to blink first and close up knowing that making a move means bloodshed only...it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because they are all going to get absolutely smashed anyway by the supreme hammer of Thor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit\\&lt;/strong&gt;* As u/ JackTheBehemothKillr pointed out in the comments: &lt;em&gt;The Good The Bad The Ugly song is from the Metallica S&amp;amp;M album, first song is Ecstasy of Gold from the movie. Transitions into Enter Sandman from the same album.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the first verse. Rest follows along with what DFV has been saying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: &amp;quot;Take my hand, off to neverneverland&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit edit: Metallica has opened every concert with that same song since the early 80s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790094668237259040\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790094668237259040&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; First scene, &amp;quot;make no mistake it&amp;#39;s not revenge he is after it&amp;#39;s a reckoning&amp;quot;, then we have a shotgun wielding man &amp;quot;you tell him i&amp;#39;m coming, and hells coming with me you hear?&amp;quot; and finally we have Narco with some baddass horse riders taking shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation: A&lt;/strong&gt;s &lt;strong&gt;u/ strikeeagle&lt;/strong&gt; points out, the Narco trumpets are synonymous with Mets fans as they bring in Edwin Diaz &amp;quot;Narco&amp;quot; to close up, usually when it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Game over&amp;quot; for the opposing team. The reckoning is coming! Oh and Steve Cohen owns the Mets of course, trading is a tough game don&amp;#39;t ya think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:30pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790102212619669909\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790102212619669909&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Pirates of the Caribbean scene where Captain Barbossa asks what has become of his precious and infamous ship, The Black Pearl. Then we have Men in Black where they press the red button and jet off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; The captain is back to take back the ship and he is pressing the red button to send this into the stratosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:00pm -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790109766389477525\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790109766389477525&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Peeky blinders, Tommy Shelby, leader of the Shelby crew is prepping his family to be on their best behaviour just before they fleece a load of the elite at the races then we have another Peeky Blinders scene in which Tommy has another plan up his sleeve but in the end keeps it simple to achieve their goals for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; DFV has a plan and all that is required from GME loving people is just to keep your plums in order and enjoy the ride, don&amp;#39;t make it more complicated than it needs to be, everything is already happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry i missed one (i was in bed by this time 1am in UK)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8pm: -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790170162265460831\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790170162265460831&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; The scene from Snatch where the Gypsy takes revenge on the gang that killed his mother after a continuing conflict throughout the film by taking to them with shotguns then we have the music video of BANG! by AJR and finally the Glengarry Glen Ross speech by Alec Baldwin with &amp;quot;oh, have i got your attention now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation:&lt;/strong&gt; Along the common theme here, Snatch is showing a big revenge with lots of shots fired and this is continued with lots more BANGS directed from Roaring Kitty. Finally the most interesting part of the video in my opinion, quoting the Glengarry Glen Ross Speech, I recommend you give it watch here but if you don&amp;#39;t have time, ABC (ALWAYS BE CLOSING), &lt;strong&gt;YOU CLOSE OR YOU HIT THE BRICKS.&lt;/strong&gt; Full scene &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQPY4LlbJ4\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have anything to add below and hope you found this helpful. I really should do some work now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buy - Hodl - DRS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love ya DFV x&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I've built pretty complicated contract templates on Conga before and although it works, it's pretty brutal writing the queries and working out the tables.\n\nOR\n\nIs there a way for me to write up the customers into a record variable within a flow and then reference them in a visualforce page template directly from the flow? Would this even be possible or would it require me to use my rather limited dev skills in writing a load of code only for it to not really work? \n\nHas anyone had a similar solution to this where you are building a template of data that is essentially all of the child records of an object but ordered in a structure where you can separate out each child record's merge fields on the template? The template itself doesn't need to be particularly beautiful, it's just to allow for the client to print off all of the customers and hand them essentially a receipt that they can sign individually. \n\nReally appreciate the feedback!",

    "body": "Ok so this is my first attempt at trying to present some DD that i was reading up on last night after seeing the proxy information come in and trying to get my head around why we haven't seen the fabled share recall on either 15/04 or 20/04 or 22/04 or \\[insert other hype date here\\]. \n\nI came across this article [https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/borrow-dynamics-around-gamestop-proxy-vote.html](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/borrow-dynamics-around-gamestop-proxy-vote.html) and i will try to sum up parts of it alongside the academic paper it refers to for those who can't read. \n\nThis isn't financial advice, i'm just a crayon sniffing chump like the rest of you trying to get a few wrinkles by actually looking things up for myself and not just blinding accepting whatever i read on this glorious subreddit. \n\nThe article talks about an academic paper published last year ([https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3673531](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3673531)) **that actually uses Gamestop as it's example for the paper** (a bit of luck i know!) to demonstrate the relationship between interest rate of share lending and share voting/recalling rights. \n\n# Why would an institution vote?\n\nSo according to the academic paper, the role of Institutional investors in public trading companies governance has long been disputed. \n\nSome argue that such institutions lack economic incentives to oversee corporate insiders, while others argue that institutions have made substantial investments in monitoring the companies they own. \n\nWhat is not disputed, however, is that the remarkable recent increase in the size and influence of institutional investors—especially index funds—has rendered their choices critical to the future of American corporate governance.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2019, The SEC made it a **lot more friendly** to lend shares and profit from that meaning they are far more likely to keep lending than to actually vote ([https://www.klgates.com/SEC-Issues-New-Guidance-for-Investment-Advisers-on-Proxy-Voting-09-26-2019](https://www.klgates.com/SEC-Issues-New-Guidance-for-Investment-Advisers-on-Proxy-Voting-09-26-2019)) or the actual filing ([https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2019/ia-5325.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2019/ia-5325.pdf)) \n\nEssentially what it boils down to is the institution weighing up the money they make from lending shares against the power of being able to vote/steer, at a corporate level, their long term investment. \n\n# What is a Record Date and How does lending shares affect voting?\n\nFirstly a Record date is simply the date at which you record the number of shares you wish to allocate voting rights to. This just not mean you have to recall the shares at this time, this process happens between the record date and the AGM or meeting at which the record date is relevant to. \n\nIn ape terms; You own a share on the record date (this year it was 15/04/2021) - if you have the rights to vote passed from your broker or owner then you can enact that right. An institution may own 8 million shares, they may have lent these out and still continue to do so, but they have filed that 5 million of those are going to be used for voting. This gets **recorded** but they don't need to come up with the actual share or voting outcome until nearer the meeting. \n\nSo when a lending agent or broker decides to allocate shares for lending, this means that those shares no longer carry the rights to vote. Only the original share can be used for voting and this can be announced with the intention on the record date. Please note if i have understood this correctly, **a Blackrock or any other institution lending shares may still intend to vote come the AGM, they would only need to specify the amount of shares they are allocating to vote with, they wouldn't need to recall shares there and then.** It should be noted as i said above, these institutions are making big bucks from lending these shares so they are probably all looking at each other hoping the other will do it so they can keep making that lending money;\n\nFrom the paper;\n\n*Any institution considering whether to recall shares on loan for voting faces a free-riding problem: the gains from enhanced governance are shared with all shareholders, while the cost of foregone lending revenues are borne by the institution recalling shares. There is a powerful incentive to hold out and hope that another institution will recall shares on loan instead.*\n\nWhat's more, Blackrock are even mentioned by name in this paper as essentially building their investment model on this process; \n\n*In fact, according to a recent MorningStar analysis, BlackRock passes only 70% of their securities lending revenues back to the fund (MorningStar, 2018). As a result, institutions like BlackRock have powerful private incentives to minimize the costs of corporate oversight and maximize the benefits from share lending.*  \n\nOne thing that is implied by the paper though and perhaps makes sense considering how much begging George Sherman did last year to encourage people to enact their right to vote, is that Gamestop wouldn't have these huge votes for this AGM (big positions being decided that will shape the future of the company for many years!) if they didn't think that they would have sufficient voting power from the shareholders, it would be too risky! \n\n# Comparing this to last year and looking at lendable shares\n\nThere have been many theories that i have read that speculate on why the borrow fee is seemingly so low for GME, i mean these must be hard shares to get hold of right? \n\nWell that might not actually be the case just yet. Institutions could have easily set aside X amount to lend out (and in theory they could just buy them back again if a short borrowed a share, then they lend that out again and so on). \n\nThis would allow an institution to still make some money lending but also maintain enough for voting rights to ensure they can impact the outcome of the meeting to best suit their long interest. \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[Graph showing lendable shares over last year - This doesn't mean all of these shares were lent out - but they were allocated and available for lending.](https://preview.redd.it/69bs07mzgxu61.png?width=1606&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d703c5b751ae308893873cb936d3f82a0f4c26ce)\n\nThe jump in % outstanding (grey) you can ignore as i believe GME bought back shares itself in order to squeeze the float down and to try and bring down the amount of available shares and in turn the amount of lendable shares. \n\nNotice the steady decline in lendable shares as we approached the AGM in June 2020.\n\n[Short interest vs borrowed shares vs share price GME 2019\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/cbkts17xixu61.png?width=1602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=04ea54cdfe0ce0f069babd77edd34e2d4791cf51)\n\n# Looking at the 2021 Proxy statement and how the institutions line up.\n\nWell after i mentioned before - the institutions must show on the proxy statement how many shares they can make available to vote with. This does not say whether they will enact that right or not, it simply just says the shares are available. Here is what the proxy says;\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[Blackrock and RC have the rights to vote or dispose all of their shares](https://preview.redd.it/prbr95iqoxu61.png?width=1147&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ffa5a949ca3ad7a6d51883682799dbea8355dc14)\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[Vanguard how could you? Is this one of the big share lenders? ](https://preview.redd.it/jotf2fs2pxu61.png?width=1148&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=65eadfd5997370559c78cbbbd4e82f98ded2f200)\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[Maverick seem to be hiding their figures and Sus have about 3 different entities\\(of course they do\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/slodetbhpxu61.png?width=1156&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4b86467d09a347909cdd01b95a71cb0cc5ee34d5)\n\n# So in conclusion as I should really do some work now...\n\nJust because the record date has passed (15/04) does not mean that shares have to be recalled just yet. It's worth keeping an eye on the borrow rate and availability of lendable shares as these numbers should drop between now and the AGM quite dramatically. I still believe Blackrock have more reason to enact their rights on 8mil+ shares this year so this could further reduce available shares if they do decide to do that. \n\nTL:DR - Lending shares is probably more profitable than voting nowadays. Watch the borrow rates, look at the AGM last year and how it bounced the price despite many institutions not recalling/voting. Most of all just relax and don't do dates, enjoy the ride and trust the new board know what they are doing! Here is a 🚀 simply because i like the stock.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so this is my first attempt at trying to present some DD that i was reading up on last night after seeing the proxy information come in and trying to get my head around why we haven&amp;#39;t seen the fabled share recall on either 15/04 or 20/04 or 22/04 or [insert other hype date here]. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came across this article &lt;a href=\"https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/borrow-dynamics-around-gamestop-proxy-vote.html\"&gt;https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/borrow-dynamics-around-gamestop-proxy-vote.html&lt;/a&gt; and i will try to sum up parts of it alongside the academic paper it refers to for those who can&amp;#39;t read. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t financial advice, i&amp;#39;m just a crayon sniffing chump like the rest of you trying to get a few wrinkles by actually looking things up for myself and not just blinding accepting whatever i read on this glorious subreddit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The article talks about an academic paper published last year (&lt;a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3673531\"&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3673531&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;that actually uses Gamestop as it&amp;#39;s example for the paper&lt;/strong&gt; (a bit of luck i know!) to demonstrate the relationship between interest rate of share lending and share voting/recalling rights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why would an institution vote?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So according to the academic paper, the role of Institutional investors in public trading companies governance has long been disputed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some argue that such institutions lack economic incentives to oversee corporate insiders, while others argue that institutions have made substantial investments in monitoring the companies they own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is not disputed, however, is that the remarkable recent increase in the size and influence of institutional investors—especially index funds—has rendered their choices critical to the future of American corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in 2019, The SEC made it a &lt;strong&gt;lot more friendly&lt;/strong&gt; to lend shares and profit from that meaning they are far more likely to keep lending than to actually vote (&lt;a href=\"https://www.klgates.com/SEC-Issues-New-Guidance-for-Investment-Advisers-on-Proxy-Voting-09-26-2019\"&gt;https://www.klgates.com/SEC-Issues-New-Guidance-for-Investment-Advisers-on-Proxy-Voting-09-26-2019&lt;/a&gt;) or the actual filing (&lt;a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2019/ia-5325.pdf\"&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2019/ia-5325.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially what it boils down to is the institution weighing up the money they make from lending shares against the power of being able to vote/steer, at a corporate level, their long term investment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What is a Record Date and How does lending shares affect voting?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly a Record date is simply the date at which you record the number of shares you wish to allocate voting rights to. This just not mean you have to recall the shares at this time, this process happens between the record date and the AGM or meeting at which the record date is relevant to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In ape terms; You own a share on the record date (this year it was 15/04/2021) - if you have the rights to vote passed from your broker or owner then you can enact that right. An institution may own 8 million shares, they may have lent these out and still continue to do so, but they have filed that 5 million of those are going to be used for voting. This gets &lt;strong&gt;recorded&lt;/strong&gt; but they don&amp;#39;t need to come up with the actual share or voting outcome until nearer the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when a lending agent or broker decides to allocate shares for lending, this means that those shares no longer carry the rights to vote. Only the original share can be used for voting and this can be announced with the intention on the record date. Please note if i have understood this correctly, &lt;strong&gt;a Blackrock or any other institution lending shares may still intend to vote come the AGM, they would only need to specify the amount of shares they are allocating to vote with, they wouldn&amp;#39;t need to recall shares there and then.&lt;/strong&gt; It should be noted as i said above, these institutions are making big bucks from lending these shares so they are probably all looking at each other hoping the other will do it so they can keep making that lending money;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the paper;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any institution considering whether to recall shares on loan for voting faces a free-riding problem: the gains from enhanced governance are shared with all shareholders, while the cost of foregone lending revenues are borne by the institution recalling shares. There is a powerful incentive to hold out and hope that another institution will recall shares on loan instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more, Blackrock are even mentioned by name in this paper as essentially building their investment model on this process; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In fact, according to a recent MorningStar analysis, BlackRock passes only 70% of their securities lending revenues back to the fund (MorningStar, 2018). As a result, institutions like BlackRock have powerful private incentives to minimize the costs of corporate oversight and maximize the benefits from share lending.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that is implied by the paper though and perhaps makes sense considering how much begging George Sherman did last year to encourage people to enact their right to vote, is that Gamestop wouldn&amp;#39;t have these huge votes for this AGM (big positions being decided that will shape the future of the company for many years!) if they didn&amp;#39;t think that they would have sufficient voting power from the shareholders, it would be too risky! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Comparing this to last year and looking at lendable shares&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been many theories that i have read that speculate on why the borrow fee is seemingly so low for GME, i mean these must be hard shares to get hold of right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well that might not actually be the case just yet. Institutions could have easily set aside X amount to lend out (and in theory they could just buy them back again if a short borrowed a share, then they lend that out again and so on). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would allow an institution to still make some money lending but also maintain enough for voting rights to ensure they can impact the outcome of the meeting to best suit their long interest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/69bs07mzgxu61.png?width=1606&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=d703c5b751ae308893873cb936d3f82a0f4c26ce\"&gt;Graph showing lendable shares over last year - This doesn&amp;#39;t mean all of these shares were lent out - but they were allocated and available for lending.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The jump in % outstanding (grey) you can ignore as i believe GME bought back shares itself in order to squeeze the float down and to try and bring down the amount of available shares and in turn the amount of lendable shares. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice the steady decline in lendable shares as we approached the AGM in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cbkts17xixu61.png?width=1602&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=04ea54cdfe0ce0f069babd77edd34e2d4791cf51\"&gt;Short interest vs borrowed shares vs share price GME 2019/20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Looking at the 2021 Proxy statement and how the institutions line up.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well after i mentioned before - the institutions must show on the proxy statement how many shares they can make available to vote with. This does not say whether they will enact that right or not, it simply just says the shares are available. Here is what the proxy says;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/prbr95iqoxu61.png?width=1147&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ffa5a949ca3ad7a6d51883682799dbea8355dc14\"&gt;Blackrock and RC have the rights to vote or dispose all of their shares&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jotf2fs2pxu61.png?width=1148&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=65eadfd5997370559c78cbbbd4e82f98ded2f200\"&gt;Vanguard how could you? Is this one of the big share lenders? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/slodetbhpxu61.png?width=1156&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4b86467d09a347909cdd01b95a71cb0cc5ee34d5\"&gt;Maverick seem to be hiding their figures and Sus have about 3 different entities(of course they do) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;So in conclusion as I should really do some work now...&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just because the record date has passed (15/04) does not mean that shares have to be recalled just yet. It&amp;#39;s worth keeping an eye on the borrow rate and availability of lendable shares as these numbers should drop between now and the AGM quite dramatically. I still believe Blackrock have more reason to enact their rights on 8mil+ shares this year so this could further reduce available shares if they do decide to do that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR - Lending shares is probably more profitable than voting nowadays. Watch the borrow rates, look at the AGM last year and how it bounced the price despite many institutions not recalling/voting. Most of all just relax and don&amp;#39;t do dates, enjoy the ride and trust the new board know what they are doing! Here is a 🚀 simply because i like the stock.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
