That's until they don't anymore so I am desparate for your sorcery!\n\nSo far, I've had internet through DSL and used a AVM 7590 Router with another AVM 7530 Router and two AVM 1200 Repeaters set up in a mesh network. (I'm in Europe)\n\nDue to the low speeds and other issues with the only available ISP, I decided to test if 5G could be my new source but I wanted to do it in a way that still leverages my existing setup.\n\nI bought a (not ISP branded) ZTE MC801a 5G Router, quickly set it up, and had DL speeds up to 1Gbps, UL up to 50Mbps and a very low ping of ~ 20 by connecting directly to the 5G Router via Wifi. I then turned on bridge mode, disabled DHCP &amp; Wifi, connected the 5G Router from LAN 1 to the WAN port of my AVM 7590 and set it to regular Router Mode.\n\nEverything seems to work normal and I can access all routers and repeaters if I am connected to the network. However, when I tested the speed on my PC via Wifi (both the ZTE and AVM are at the same location), the speed is 70% slower than if I connect to the ZTE via Wifi directly. I also realized I don't have an IPv6 address when connected to the AVM, but have both IPv4 and IPv6 when connected to the ZTE. Also, the WAN IPv4 of the ZTE is 192.0.0.2? I know that my carrier uses CGNAT, which is the first NAT. I think the ZTE Router is introducing another NAT, and the AVM Router another one. \n\nI tried testing things that apprently are impacted by NAT issues (like joining Discord voice chats), but didn't have issues. My only issue is network speed. Btw, the two routers are connected by a short (1m, that's around 3ft) CAT6 cable and I also ensured there's no energy saving shenanigans causing this throttled speed.\n\nI actually have no idea if this NAT thing is even related to network speed so any help is GREATLY appreciated ",

Btw, the two routers are connected by a short (1m, that&amp;#39;s around 3ft) CAT6 cable and I also ensured there&amp;#39;s no energy saving shenanigans causing this throttled speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually have no idea if this NAT thing is even related to network speed so any help is GREATLY appreciated &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

There's a process called a self-test (or -check), where the bike checks if all systems are clear - basically - and it is precisely here where ABS, TC and the quick shifter get initiated. The OEM dash communicates SOMETHING to or from the ECU (or other components) that we have not managed to \"sniff\" out yet. This is a major road block that takes time and commitment which is hard because both of us work fulltime on our jobs or own other businesses.\n\nIn the meantime we did have some updates in other areas (new tools, updated UI from Dom who's a design genius!). We are trying something new currently and have sunk quite a bit of money too in consulting experienced engineers in this field and buying expensive equipment - to no success so far. If we can't get through this within the next few weeks, we will post log files and corresponding tools to let the community help us analyse the data.\n\nPS: Excuse me for my late response times in the DMs and comments, I haven't been on Reddit much lately\n\n*Check the comments for a other close up video*",

The clutch does not fully disengage even when pulled to the bar. When the bike is in first and the clutch is fully pulled, the bike still moves forward. It stalled on me quite a few times on that first ride until I realized what's wrong. The lever felt way softer than I remember too. I replaced my clutch fluid and bleed it properly to make sure there's no air in it, but now it's even worse. Can't turn on the engine in first, and if I do in neutral it stalls immediately when shifting to first. \n\nI believe that the bike's clutch cylinder got swapped during that recall a few years ago so it shouldn't be that? Might this be a symptom for stuck clutch plates maybe? I also tried letting it idle in Neutral while I zip-tied my clutch lever to the bar as someone had suggested but nothing worked.\n\n",

We did reverse engineer the physical buttons on the dash to turn those off manually, but they don''t work for turning them back on.\n\n2) Very likely related to the first issue, the quick shifter doesn't work when we connect our custom dash. So that's issue #2.\n\nAs some of you may know, there are a few other folks working on similar projects and we've decided to work on this project together with one of them (Fred) with the hope of solving those major issues.\n\nIf any of you has substantial knowledge and/or a degree in electrical engineering, ideally in an automotive context, and you want to help get this project forward, please reach out! \n\nIf you have experience with C or C++, and have some basic reverse engineering experience, this might be helpful too - reach out through DMs!",

This would give me a lot of flexibility in terms of setting up the height of everything amd saving a lot of space as well.\n\nWhat do you think about this and can you recommend a cockpit for this?

While planning this huge trip, I checked out what the foreign ministry of my country has to say about Algeria, and it sounded a bit troublesome. Knowing how these reports are usually extremely exaggerated, I came here to ask you.\n\nPart of my trip would be to drive all the way from Tunis to Gibraltar which of course includes driving through a big chunk of Algeria. I want to go as far south as permitted and safe, and visit as many places as I can from East to West. My plan for crossing Algeria would give me about a week or more for it so I hope that's plenty of time to explore. \n\nSo my questions:\n- Is it safe to travel to and between more remote areas?\n- How is the road quality on the main streets / highways?\n- I read that crossing from Algeria to Marocco might be trouble, any info on this?\n\nI am male and will travel alone",

Slow because I decided to overhaul the whole software behind the logic that gets the data from the bike. I initially wanted to get the data using the OBD port, which worked fine for a lot of stuff, but after a while I found that it is very limited and does not store data such as the odometer, gear, indicator and light symbols among many other things. Instead, I am now tapping directly to the CAN BUS and can read literally all data. \n\nNow, most of that data does not yet make a lot of sense because it's formatted using a proprietary table that Husqvarna/KTM will never share with anyone - and there's no way to extract that table from the original dash (if you are some hacker genius that can reverse engineer software from microchips, let me know! Lol). \n\nAs you can see on the picture, I've jerry-rigged my tooling device to my bike and had it running a program that I've written. The program basically reads the whole network in various states of the bike (ignition on, engine on) without me doing anything, and then prompts me to do certain things like turn on the left indicator etc. My program then listens to the messages and tries to give me the messages that have been sent during that specific prompt - which ultimately narrows down the code that stands for the left indicator in this particular example. \n\nThe user interface software hasn't changed a lot because I focused on the back end for now, and the UI was almost done anyway. \n\nFeel free to ask questions!",

I followed the manual accurately and replaced both oil filters, and all necessary o-rings (also on those thinner sticks I don't know the english word). As per the manual, I did the oil change while on the side stand. I did not tilt the bike to the right side during the draining (I probably should have), but left it drip for quite some time - it was a bit messy to be honest but I tried to clean all areas before reassembling. I also did a quick ride before and left it cool down just a bit before I started. The oil tank fits 2L, but as per the manual I only filled in 1.7L. When I look at the oil level while on the side stand, it obv. showing nothing, when I tilted it to center, it showed over max. I then stared the engine while on the side stand, to check the oil level and then there was quite a bit of very watery oil dripping from one of the two drain plugs (the center one, facing the front wheel). I stopped the engine, cleaned it up, sat on the bike upright and started the engine again and let it idle: Now I was getting a very small oil drip. I checked the oil level while center and with the engine running again, and now it showed to be above middle but below max. There is zero leakage anywhere else beside that drain plug.\n\n1. Is there too much oil? Even if I did not drain it properly, I have not put in the whole 2L and after the second attempt it somewhat looks fine?\n2. Do I have an oil leak or could it be that I simply did not clean it enough? Could it be that I overtightened the drain plug nut?\n\nImages\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DCQF5Lq",

Anyways, I hate the speedometer/dashboard so much that it motivated me enough to try and build a custom one. I know that Bad Winners sells Custom Dashboards for the Vit for about 800 bucks, but if you look at comments of people who've ordered one, most have been waiting for almost a year. Those who did get theirs, report that it's not working well enough. \n\nBecause I don't have the bike yet, I focused on all the software bits and pieces. Here's a summary of the technical details if you're interested:\n\n1. Using an Arduino Uno 3, a CAN BUS Shield, and a DB9&lt;-&gt;OBDII adapter, I can sniff out \"custom\" PIDs. I am doing this on my car for practice and testing\n2. I have a Raspberry Pi 4 connected to my car's OBDII port\n3. I have written Python which through the OBD library reads from the OBDII port, and exposes the data through basically a local websocket (using Flask and SocketIO) to a locally hosted webpage (build with HTML, CSS and JS). All of this runs in Kiosk Mode on the Raspberry Pi 4\n\n**Screenshot of my current (pre-alpha) speedo design:** (this is the EASIEST part to change, so don't be harsh on it lol):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qhj0ca2247a1.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e7bc9ad315a59edd31381785276f0d420f0d82\n\n**What's missing:**\n\n1. Screen: It will very likely be an 5\" AMOLED screen (960Ã—544) or 5\" IPS (800Ã—480), both touch\n2. Case/Housing: 3d print\n\n**Where I need your help:**\n\n*Case*\n\nThe case will need a mount which fits perfectly into the backplate of the original husky speedo. This part basically: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqybkr63247a1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e10a31b5cf4a91299ce6a6a7e1820a7c5735fcc\n\nIf anyone has this laying around and could measure it, I'd appreciate it. I guess nobody will want to disassemble it though, so if you can measure the front of it, that'd be beneficial for the selection of the screen too! \n\n**Also, if you are familiar with 3D priting, designing STL files, everything CAN related, or a RPI geek and want to participate - please let me know!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Feedback**\n\nLet me know which things you would like to see displayed, and I'll incorporate them! **All of the parts, code, instructions, will be shared once this thing get's going properly!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For folks driving something other than Vit/Svartpilen** but interested in a custom dashboard: Once we get this working, all you need is a different mount (and maybe a few more PIDs) for it to work on your bike too!",

    "body": "Hey Folks,\n\nso I absolutely fell in love with the Vitpilen 701 and have been looking to buy one these past few weeks. Where I live its winter, so no pressure! Anyways, I hate the speedometer/dashboard so much that it motivated me enough to try and build a custom one. I know that Bad Winners sells Custom Dashboards for the Vit for about 800 bucks, but if you look at comments of people who've ordered one, most have been waiting for almost a year. Those who did get theirs, report that it's not working well enough. \n\nBecause I don't have the bike yet, I focused on all the software bits and pieces. Here's a summary of the technical details if you're interested:\n\n1. Using an Arduino Uno 3, a CAN BUS Shield, and a DB9&lt;-&gt;OBDII adapter, I can sniff out \"custom\" PIDs. I am doing this on my car for practice and testing\n2. I have a Raspberry Pi 4 connected to my car's OBDII port\n3. I have written Python which through the OBD library reads from the OBDII port, and exposes the data through basically a local websocket (using Flask and SocketIO) to a locally hosted webpage (build with HTML, CSS and JS). All of this runs in Kiosk Mode on the Raspberry Pi 4\n\n**Screenshot of my current (pre-alpha) speedo design:** (this is the EASIEST part to change, so don't be harsh on it lol):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hab9f4b9147a1.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9fb839bd0f8dbe1ed712cf2ccc2a9d72ce6b3c5\n\n**What's missing:**\n\n1. Screen: It will very likely be an 5\" AMOLED screen (960Ã—544) or 5\" IPS (800Ã—480), both touch\n2. Case/Housing: 3d print\n\n**Where I need your help:**\n\n*Case*\n\nThe case will need a mount which fits perfectly into the backplate of the original husky speedo. This part basically: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llydyy5w047a1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2fdfd29a8d2755286a5b0fb67914bd7b8a0efba\n\nIf anyone has this laying around and could measure it, I'd appreciate it. I guess nobody will want to disassemble it though, so if you can measure the front of it, that'd be beneficial for the selection of the screen too! \n\n**Also, if you are familiar with 3D priting, designing STL files, everything CAN related, or a RPI geek and want to participate - please let me know!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Feedback**\n\nLet me know which things you would like to see displayed, and I'll incorporate them! **All of the parts, code, instructions, will be shared once this thing get's going properly!**",

    "communityName": "r/1899",
    "parsedCommunityName": "1899",
    "body": "Hi. A german podcast called \"StreamgestÃ¶ber\" had Bo and Jantje on their show and released the episode today. I listed to it and made notes in English to share with you. I found it highly interesting! It's not a word by word translation but me paraphrasing what they said. I clustered it into different overall topics for a better reading experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Origins of 1899**\n\nThe idea came before Dark in roughly 2014. It was sparked by an old photograph Bo and Jantje have seen, of a man covered in blood, holding a hammer, in what appeared to be an old boat. So they started thinking, who this man was and where he came from. After the initial idea, the refugee crisis in Europe started, at some point Brexit was decided, and those among other world events inspired them to make it about European refugees who have to survive together despite being different and not understanding each other. The first season of 1899 is part of the original deal Bo and Jantje made with Netflix. There is a short reference to the guy with a hammer in one of the bursts, which Jantje did not disclose what it meant, but she implied that it will means something (in the future).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Inspiration for 1899**\n\nDuring Season 2 and 3 of Dark, 1899 got formed. They are of course big fans of Lost, but the main inspiration was a big philosophical idea that they stumbled upon which they found very interesting - because it asks a question that Bo and Jantje ask themselves often too. So there is a lot of science and philosophical inspiration. They did watch a lot of short YouTube videos to get introduced into some of the philosphical and scientific ideas and were impressed by the content. They always look for symbolic stuff. Jantje reads a lot of scientific books, and Bo only watches short youtube videos and thinks (jokingly) that he might have ADHD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Main Theme of 1899**\n\nThe main theme of the series is simulation theory and quantum mechanics. The question of what is reality, and how to know what reality is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What should fans take away from 1899**\n\nBo and Jantje are seekers - they ask a lot of questions. The series should motivate people to ask themselves questions and get out of the everyday loop. Ask themselves where am I, why am I? Why do we exist, and why does our planet exist? What is reality? Bo referenced Plato's Cave Allegory again. They also talked briefly about a theory of Nick Bostrom, who is a scientist from Norway, which describes that we might actually be in a simulation right now. They don't dive into these topics to find an answer to it, but to play with it in their series. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Future of 1899**\n\nJantje knows exactly where the characters are planned to go emotionally, and also where the overall plot is going. During development, new stuff (like scenes) might be added. What they don't know yet though is the order of things. Jantje mentioned that originally they planned to introduce the other paralel universe of Dark (Martha's World) in S2, and then decided to do it in S3. Bo and Jantje are constantly talking about 1899 and dynamically developing new stuff. The little stuff they lay out (like stories being told by characters) are there for a reason though, and meant to be picked up later on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About twists, and their favorite moments**\n\nBo says that Episode 1 already tells and shows you everything. There is one hint, that according to Bo no one has realized yet, which was put in there to show that all of this makes no sense / can't be real. Jantje's favorite moment is when Maura goes through the shaft for the first time, and drops into her memory through the little square. She finds the idea of deconstructing reality to be touching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**about language selection vs. dubbed**\n\nIt was a long discussion about how to handle the dubbed versions of the show and if they should even do that. They tested the first episode in English and German dubbed, and felt that its good in its own right. It is intentional that the dubbed versions focus more on the mystery and exploration of that, and less (or almost none at all) on the language aspect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**music**\n\nThe ending/outro songs are meant to fit lyrically and melodically from a mood and plot perspective (ideally all of it, but not all words of the lyrics always fit) - the songs were already written into the scripts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Season 2?**\n\nThe triangles and other symbols will be explained in Season 2. Maura's brother will be a main character. Bo and Jantje treat their series as films. Meaning each season is one act, hence three seasons of three acts. The first season was about introducing and establishment, asking a big question. The second season/act is about fun &amp; games - playing with the themes, getting even bigger and crazier and wild, and then the third season is about resolution. IF there is a second season.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**various topics**\n\nThey saw the volume technology first through Mandolorian. Both Bo and Jantje play video games. Bo was VR-scouting a virtual location, when a bug happened and he was thrown into a matrix-looking waiting room and felt dead. That also pushed him to incorporate that feeling of dread more into 1899. Bo and Jantje are fans of Hong Kong, and their films. The Captain (Eyk) was meant to be Danish in the very beginning. They couldn't take all european languages because it would have been too much (hence no Italian or Greek for example). It was not a wish from Netflix to have so many actors known from other Netflix shows, they were a bit reluctant because they thought it might be confusing. Bo and Jantje did brutal casting with multiple rounds. The best performances won. Jantje is a big fan of reality tv. She watched The Mole but found it intriging. Bo was surprised by the Dahmer series, because he thought it was highly intelligently shown. Bo is obsessed with serial killers. Bo recommends watching Andor (the new Star Wars series), despite not being a huge fan of the recent Star Wars stuff. Loves the performance and the way it was told. Jantje laughingly recommends Love is Blind Japan (lol), because she finds it interesting how people from other cultures fall in love. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe podcast moderator told them that they can now chill out and have a look at how Reddit explodes with theories, to which Bo said \"Hopefully\". \n\n# SO WE KNOW THEY ARE LURKING THE SUB.",

If I disable it, I get more frames so I don't get how it works. I set the bitrate to 700 and SS to 1.5 ... I have the latest CSP Version installed and that new VR rendering option enabled.\n\n2.

    "body": "Hi Everyone,\n\na few years ago I had an iPhone 6 which fell down from a decent height and thus broke apart. It did turn on and the screen did turn on as well, but the screen was completely destroyed and the touch wasn't really working, I didn't have the funds to get it repaired back then and left it in a drawer because I had photos on it that were very important to me. Life happened and I forgot about it until I found it again a few days ago after it had been sitting in its original packaging for roughly three years. I ordered a new screen, battery and dock (the part where lightning connection and headphone jack is) and installed the parts very diligently. \n\nUnfortunately it won't turn on. I know it may have been naive to think it would but I really want to try everything I can before I accept that it probably won't ever turn again.\n\nSo my question is, can you help me troubleshoot and find out which part is malfunctioning? The screen heats up a little on the upper side, so I guess there is at least some power going through the phone. Any ideas how to check the logic board with a multimeter? Or maybe its just the power button that isn't working haha!\n\nI would highly appreciate if you could help me narrow down the issues, it would mean the world to me!\n\nEdit: First of all, massive thanks to everyone trying to help! I took out the logic board and found that it was bent on the backside (didn't see that before) and I think this may be the issue. The area around the NAND gets hot too when I connect the logicboard to power. \n\nImgur Album of bent logic board: https://imgur.com/a/Ymh9GG2\n\nCan someone explain if and how I could check which part exactly is causing this by using a multimeter? I want to try to pin point it to be 100% sure its the CPU or whatever so I know if there's a realistic chance of fixing it. Worst that can happen is that I think its an unfixable issue while in reality it may be a minor issue. Any help would be appreciated!",

I already know how to rig the vehicle, import it, set the collision, create the blueprints etc. and have successfully done it with a simple model. \n\nI am now trying to do the same thing with a much more complex model that has 4M vertices and 4,5M tris. The reason its so complex is because its a whole vehicle CAD from an engineerig project. I got everything done and imported in UE4, but I am struggling with the collision.\n\nWhat I usually do is open the physical asset, select the vehicle body and turn the Primitive Type to Single Convex Hull which creates a fairly nice collision for low complex vehicles or even the wheels of my complex model. If I try to do that for the body though, UE does not respond and I have to kill the process. \n\nBeside creating a low poly model, is there a quicker way to get this working? I tried V-HACD in Blender to directly create the collision in Blender, but couldn't get it running. I would even be okay with a box collision shape, but can't find how to move the box in UE, because it is sitting to low and preventing the wheels from touching the ground.\n\nThanks!\n\nPS: [Screenshot for reference](https://i.imgur.com/40A2CDC.png)",
