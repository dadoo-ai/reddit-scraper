    "body": "Hello Yard-Yoga practitioners (that's what i call sprinkler work),\n\nI wonder if you can give me some hints to get me going in the right direction. I have a Hardie Sprinkler valve that came with the house. The valve won't open all the way when the solenoid is activated.\n\nWhen the solenoid is activated, I can feel and hear it click open, and I can hear water running, just a little. When I test the solenoid alone with a 9v battery, the solenoid piston retracts about 1/8\".\n\nI have opened the valve (taken off the 6 screws), and verified that there is a clear passage between the main chamber of the valve and the miniature \"solenoid chamber\". The diaphragm does not seem to be broken, and seems flexible.\n\nWhat almost works:\n\nWith the solenoid on, if I unscrew the flow control knob on the valve, the water starts to hammer, and water trickles out of the 4 heads to about a 1' radius.\n\nIf I unscrew the solenoid 1/4-1/2 turn, the valve opens all the way. But there is water leaking from where the solenoid meets the valve body.\n\nWhat else should I check? Thanks!",
