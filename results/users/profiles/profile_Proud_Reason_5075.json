I was up to 25 gpd by 2017/2018, sometimes more but mostly 25 gpd. I started tapering here and there since. About 4 months ago, I was down to about 15 gpd and had this horrible feeling of extremely dry skin on my face especially, but all over, eyes were dry, mouth was dry. Drank lots of water with trace minerals and even electrolyte powder, which you do want to limit.\n\nFor this reason, I decided to accelerate my taper. I wanted nothing more to do with this sh\\*t. I'm not taking it now and haven't for a few days, but I was down to 3 gpd a day, so it was like not taking it anyway. And I feel the same as when I was taking 3 gpd.\n\nOver the last couple months, I have developed burning, tingling skin, sometimes itchy spots, it gets worse as the morning progresses, especially when I eat. It's gone when I wake up, but then it starts and stays, and increases in waves.\n\nI've searched high and low to see if this was a withdrawal symptom and I did find some posts here stating they had something similar but none that seemed to have it as long as I have. Mine is everywhere, but my arms and legs, face are the worst, feet too. Torso. OK, everywhere.\n\nI did a search not in this sub but in all of reddit and I found that people are experiencing this issue from withdrawing from a variety of substances such as:\n\n* Benzodiazepine\n* Gabapentin\n* SSRIs - Lyrica, Lexapro\n* JUUL\n* Topical Steroids\n* Clonidine\n* Opiates - ALL\n* Rinvoq - eczema treatment\n* And of course, Kratom\n\nI do wonder if it's a symptom of a variety of substances that numb you out and when you stop, the nerves begin to wake up, but I don't know that for sure. When will my own dopamine kick in?!\n\nAnyway, has anyone here experienced this issue after stopping Kratom for at least a few months but it eventually subsided? Thank you",

    "body": "UPDATE: for anyone experiencing the same, it is getting better. \n\nI first discovered Kratom back in 2009. I didn't start using it regularly until around 2015. I was up to 25 gpd by 2017/2018, sometimes more but mostly 25 gpd. I started tapering here and there since. About 4 months ago, I was down to about 15 gpd and had this horrible feeling of extremely dry skin on my face especially, but all over, eyes were dry, mouth was dry. Drank lots of water with trace minerals and even electrolyte powder, which you do want to limit.\n\nFor this reason, I decided to accelerate my taper. I wanted nothing more to do with this sh\\*t. I'm not taking it now and haven't for a few days, but I was down to 3 gpd a day, so it was like not taking it anyway. And I feel the same as when I was taking 3 gpd.\n\nOver the last couple months, I have developed burning, tingling skin, sometimes itchy spots, it gets worse as the morning progresses, especially when I eat. It's gone when I wake up, but then it starts and stays, and increases in waves.\n\nI've searched high and low to see if this was a withdrawal symptom and I did find some posts here stating they had something similar but none that seemed to have it as long as I have. Mine is everywhere, but my arms and legs, face are the worst, feet too. Torso. OK, everywhere.\n\nI did a search not in this sub but in all of reddit and I found that people are experiencing this issue from withdrawing from a variety of substances such as:\n\n* Benzodiazepine\n* Gabapentin\n* SSRIs - Lyrica, Lexapro\n* JUUL\n* Topical Steroids\n* Clonidine\n* Opiates - ALL\n* Rinvoq - eczema treatment\n* And of course, Kratom\n\nI do wonder if it's a symptom of a variety of substances that numb you out and when you stop, the nerves begin to wake up, but I don't know that for sure. When will my own dopamine kick in?!\n\nAnyway, has anyone here experienced this issue after stopping Kratom for at least a few months but it eventually subsided? Thank you",

    "body": "UPDATE: for anyone experiencing the same, it is getting better. \n\nI first discovered Kratom back in 2009. I didn't start using it regularly until around 2015. I was up to 25 gpd by 2017/2018, sometimes more but mostly 25 gpd. I started tapering here and there since. About 4 months ago, I was down to about 15 gpd and had this horrible feeling of extremely dry skin on my face especially, but all over, eyes were dry, mouth was dry. Drank lots of water with trace minerals and even electrolyte powder, which you do want to limit.\n\nFor this reason, I decided to accelerate my taper. I wanted nothing more to do with this sh\\*t. I'm not taking it now and haven't for a few days, but I was down to 3 gpd a day, so it was like not taking it anyway. And I feel the same as when I was taking 3 gpd.\n\nOver the last couple months, I have developed burning, tingling skin, sometimes itchy spots, it gets worse as the morning progresses, especially when I eat. It's gone when I wake up, but then it starts and stays, and increases in waves.\n\nI've searched high and low to see if this was a withdrawal symptom and I did find some posts here stating they had something similar but none that seemed to have it as long as I have. Mine is everywhere, but my arms and legs, face are the worst, feet too. Torso. OK, everywhere.\n\nI did a search not in this sub but in all of reddit and I found that people are experiencing this issue from withdrawing from a variety of substances such as:\n\n* Benzodiazepine\n* Gabapentin\n* SSRIs - Lyrica, Lexapro\n* JUUL\n* Topical Steroids\n* Clonidine\n* Opiates - ALL\n* Rinvoq - eczema treatment\n* And of course, Kratom\n\nI do wonder if it's a symptom of a variety of substances that numb you out and when you stop, the nerves begin to wake up, but I don't know that for sure. When will my own dopamine kick in?!\n\nAnyway, has anyone here experienced this issue after stopping Kratom for at least a few months but it eventually subsided? Thank you",

    "body": "UPDATE: for anyone experiencing the same, it is getting better. \n\nI first discovered Kratom back in 2009. I didn't start using it regularly until around 2015. I was up to 25 gpd by 2017/2018, sometimes more but mostly 25 gpd. I started tapering here and there since. About 4 months ago, I was down to about 15 gpd and had this horrible feeling of extremely dry skin on my face especially, but all over, eyes were dry, mouth was dry. Drank lots of water with trace minerals and even electrolyte powder, which you do want to limit.\n\nFor this reason, I decided to accelerate my taper. I wanted nothing more to do with this sh\\*t. I'm not taking it now and haven't for a few days, but I was down to 3 gpd a day, so it was like not taking it anyway. And I feel the same as when I was taking 3 gpd.\n\nOver the last couple months, I have developed burning, tingling skin, sometimes itchy spots, it gets worse as the morning progresses, especially when I eat. It's gone when I wake up, but then it starts and stays, and increases in waves.\n\nI've searched high and low to see if this was a withdrawal symptom and I did find some posts here stating they had something similar but none that seemed to have it as long as I have. Mine is everywhere, but my arms and legs, face are the worst, feet too. Torso. OK, everywhere.\n\nI did a search not in this sub but in all of reddit and I found that people are experiencing this issue from withdrawing from a variety of substances such as:\n\n* Benzodiazepine\n* Gabapentin\n* SSRIs - Lyrica, Lexapro\n* JUUL\n* Topical Steroids\n* Clonidine\n* Opiates - ALL\n* Rinvoq - eczema treatment\n* And of course, Kratom\n\nI do wonder if it's a symptom of a variety of substances that numb you out and when you stop, the nerves begin to wake up, but I don't know that for sure. When will my own dopamine kick in?!\n\nAnyway, has anyone here experienced this issue after stopping Kratom for at least a few months but it eventually subsided? Thank you",
