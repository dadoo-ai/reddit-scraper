I stayed up all night playing after I finally 'got it.' \n\nI found a really nice balance in running missions while I waited for cash flow to catch up after building stuff or taking stock and improving my passive income when autopiloting across long distances or shoving off some annoying delivery missions to my trader ships because I didn't feel like flying to 5 different places to do a single delivery mission. Also learning that travel speed is one of the single most important things for when you want to do things yourself was a huge help. I love the Mako for that and am probably going all in on the BOR ships because I think they look cool.\n\nI'm saving up for my first large ship. I like spending my down time in Hatikvah blowing up Xenons but my party gets pooped on when they eventually send a destroyer in. I am looking forward to that one. \n\nAs for fleets, I was curious if there were any mods/strats that make a personal fleet....useful? It feels like right now the AI for my ships just isn't good enough at all. I just assign them as subordinate to me in the fleet and set their mode to 'defend commander', so maybe I am telling them to go die and not realizing it. I've also only flown with 3-4 ships at a time but they very often end up getting damaged or totally wiped out in regular dog fights. I don't need them to be ace pilots or anything, I just need them to quick blowing up my expensive ships!",

    "body": "In my 10 years so far with tech, I have had the absolute pleasure to work alongside some brilliantly talented and well educated programmers. However, I have seen those same developers have their arguments and perspectives fall flat, despite their technical prowess, while less technically gifted minds withhold tremendously valuable ideas for fear of being caught on a technicality or unknown detail.\n\nTL;DR - We are taught that cleanliness and efficiency of code is the earmark of a quality solution. While important, we fail to educate programmers on the importance of factors beyond the code and how to navigate the complexity and priorities of a real application. This post is for anyone who is truly curious about what \"good code\" really means, and for those who suspect the answer has more to do with the problems you solve than the language you use to do it.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGoodhart's Law - \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\"\n\nI think most of us have experienced those often frustrating debates between programmers where one is claiming the other has an inferior approach because \"I could write it faster by doing x.\" or \"I could write it with less complexity by doing y.\"\n\nMy goal with this post is to primarily open up discussion around this topic and hopefully provide something valuable from my 10 years of doing software development.\n\nBefore I dig in, I think it's only fair to say where I come from. I have worked the last 10 years in cloud development, working with a lot of different SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS technologies. I have dabbled a LITTLE in hardware and lower level languages - but never really had to do much in terms of deploying code for a new piece of hardware and have, admittedly, been a bit spoiled on not having to deal with things like managing pointers or resolving memory errors at a lower level. However, what I want to talk about should be a fair bit removed from that level of granularity and speaks more to how we as programmers approach a problem. That being said, I have worked as an admin using declarative tools, managed code bases of several million lines, and successfully implemented several medium and large scale system architectures in my time. That is to say, I've seen a lot of shit in the last decade.\n\n**Conflating personal skills with solution quality**\n\nWith the preface out of the way, let me put my assertion straight. I see a lot of programmers conflating their proficiency with coding (speed to write code, initial resilience of code, complexity mitigation, readability, testability, etc.) as a reflection of solution quality. It is a frequent and concerning problem that many programmers are taught or conclude that the quality of how the code is written is above the functionality of the existing application.\n\nFor clarity, I am not saying that things like readability are irrelevant to the measurement of a solution's quality. Of course, all other things equal, a solution with more readable code is a better solution than the same with less readable code. What I am saying is that the actual influence of these metrics varies depending on the environment and context of the implemented solution.\n\nFor example, a small scale and local utility (such as a simple script for managing files in a folder) does not gain nearly as much proportional benefit from more readable code as a large scale ETL job managed by multiple people from multiple teams working in multiple frameworks. We could deliberate endlessly on what the \"correct\" weighting of these metrics are for any given project, but the real issue is when these metrics become surrogates for the strategic goal of the application.\n\nThe reality is that, when it comes down to the application running and doing its job, the only thing that matters is how well it does its job: How efficiently does it succeed when it is provided valid inputs, how effectively does it recover from unexpected inputs/results, and how safely does it fail in the event of an unrecoverable error?\n\nNobody cares that you made it super readable if it doesn't work. Nobody cares that you wrote it faster if it's laden with bugs. No one is happy that you reduced 30 lines to 2 lines if it makes the application a total resource hog. Similarly, nobody cares if it runs 500ms faster UNLESS that 500ms makes a difference in the grand scheme of the tech.\n\nSimply put, there is an important and clear distinction between your skills as a programmer, and the quality of the solution you produce. While your technical skills as a programmer are EXTREMELY important, they do not necessarily ensure that the solutions you produce are quality solutions. It's a mistake I have seen a lot of developers make, and it leaves them bewildered because they felt they did everything right. It reminds me of the classic Indiana Jones scene when Jones simply shoots the guy showing off all his fancy moves. It looks cool, super impressive, but totally useless in the wrong context.\n\n**Programming and solution quality is impacted by the real world and supporting relationships.**\n\n\"I would've never written it this way. They could've easily done x to make this better.\"\n\nWe've all felt that way at least once. You are SO blessed to finally work on that bit of code that hasn't been touched in 25 years just to find it is such a convoluted mess of outdated checks, redundant assignments, tightly coupled classes, et al. The feat of the developers goes from \"This is really nice and sensible code that I can work with.\" to \"How the hell did the last guy keep this thing running at all?\"\n\nThis sentiment that you would've done it better by doing it your way is almost always a lie you're telling yourself. Here's why:\n\nProgramming, as we all hopefully understand by now, is an iterative process. That means to reach your ideal state, you necessarily cannot jump from step 0 to the final step. There are checkpoints you must cross in order to get there. However, these checkpoints are marked by the application's functionality, and the structure/ease of the code is loosely implied by the business/client at best.\n\nIn other words, the developer will always be pressured to produce functional code over \"clean\" code. I am not referring to the actual principles of Clean Code necessarily, just whatever your idea of the \"right way to write the code\" is.\n\nThis means that leading into these checkpoints, there are always unanswered questions and missing pieces of context that we wish we would have had in the beginning. I just recently was working on a report generation tool for a friend when, just a week before we needed it to be done, they decided to clarify that certain parts of the report needed to have dynamic labeling and columns when we had already understood them as static elements. As you can imagine, that's a totally different approach than I had originally planned for. With not enough time to totally rewrite the program, I had a choice:\n\n1. Quickly refactor the code, accept that it'll be a bit messy, defer proper restructuring, happy client because it works.\n2. Ask for an extension to the deadline, customer misses their reporting window, blame them for not being clear and not knowing that information at the beginning?\n\nI, of course, asked for the extension. They, of course, denied the request. So, I went with option 1. Why? Because the relationship was more valuable to me than the structure of my code. I will absolutely take on a bit of a messier solution on the backend to secure another future project and ensure the client is happy **in this scenario**.\n\nThat's not to say it's always the right answer. I have refused to deploy changes that were of security or regulatory concern because not going to jail was more important than winning another project. I'm not even saying I am always right in which options I take for these situations. My point, as highlighted by the title of this section, is that the world around the application matters a LOT. Assuming you would have done it better without knowing all of the context for why those decisions were made is not only unfair to the previous developers, but is simply a conclusion driven by ego.\n\nTying this back to our main theme, you are measuring the quality of the solution based on metrics which are not the goal. The goal was a functional app that satisfied the defined requirements within the allotted timeline. That's it.\n\n**Programmers have limitations. It's okay to not be a superhuman.**\n\nI'm going to pivot the focus a bit and talk more about you - the programmer. I'm not going to say that every programmer is an antisocial basement dweller who would never suffer the presence of another human being or (God-forbid) a team building exercise. We know that already (jk).\n\nSeriously, though, there are some INCREDIBLE programmers out there. I've seen people who have mastered a multitude of frameworks, seem to 100x processing times every time they touch something, and can build a decent MVP, if given all the info up front, at a break-neck pace.\n\nBut, I have also seen programmers who are incredible in a different way. They may be slower on the keyboard, but they do a much better job at diagnosing issues and getting to the root cause of a problem. Some of them are incredible at interpersonal relationship building (very valuable in tech as a programmer, just saying). Some can understand a seemingly limitless amount of complexity and boil things down to a simple direction that everyone understands. I've met and managed a few that seemed to be able to do all of it and more entirely on their own (usually 25+ YoE on those guys/gals).\n\nWe say this all the time, but I think we forget to take our own advice: Programming is so much more than the code. For every rockstar programmer I have had the pleasure of working with, I could identify several issues working with them. Even the guy who does it all tends to be a victim of their own success and struggles to not dominate the room when collaboration is a must. Everyone has their gaps in knowledge and that's okay. Programming is an absurdly broad, dense, and deep discipline.\n\nI say this, because I still see it as a big issue in tech today. I think AI has really inflamed the issue too (I won't be getting into that) because of how many different ways there are to use this, frankly, very powerful tool. Please, for the sake of your sanity and enjoyment of programming, do not measure yourself OR OTHERS on a single dimension. It is my belief that a pillar of a good programmer is the ability to appreciate solutions and strengths which they do not possess nor understand, and the ability to keep the big picture in mind when addressing a potential weakness in themselves, the solution, or another programmer. Remember, comparison is the thief of joy.\n\n**What leads to the surrogation of goals in software?**\n\nI think it takes a lot of tolerance for uncertainty to work in tech. After all, your job is to essentially invent things that don't exist yet. Sure, there's a million pdf parsers out there, but there isn't one that does EXACTLY what you need the EXACT way you need it. There are 1000s of security camera models out there, but your new camera design (hopefully) taps into something the market is being starved of.\n\nBut, what the hell do you do when something like blockchain hits it big? What if you're required to use a library you've never even heard of? What if Maggie in accounting can't so much as find the damn Windows start button, yet she's the VP of your project and wants to know every little technical detail just to ridicule things she doesn't understand? Dammit Maggie, it's a REST call! IT'S JUST A....\n\nOn top of that, we hardly have much consensus on what \"good code\" even is - or the \"right\" way to do it. We had waterfall for some 30 years, then Agile happened, but we still have waterfall and now we have hybrid Waterfall/Agile teams with varying adherence to either paradigm. Sometimes they just make up their own rules and call it Agile because they do stuff on a bi-weekly cadence.\n\nPlus, you have Scrum and Kanban muddying the waters. But, you also have standards like TOGAF and ITIL. Let's also not forget how SaaS providers like Jira have their own rules to abide by. Honorable mention to the books and onslaught of professionals saying \"I have figured it out! Buy my shit.\" That's all before you even get to the framework you're going to be working in. It's a freaking mess!\n\nThe reality is, we just don't know what perfect code is. We can generally approximate when code is written poorly or well, and we can loosely articulate the reasons and speculations around that approximation, but we don't \\*know\\* if it's right except for very specific cases (of which there are still many examples). Nearly everything is up to debate, and it can be really hard to be certain that the code we write is good. Except, it doesn't need to be.\n\n**Preventing surrogation of goals.**\n\nIronically, one of the most important lessons I have learned in tech has been from the least technical users I have encountered. I learned that there are two questions that should always be guiding a solution.\n\n1. Why does this work?\n2. Why doesn't this work?\n\nIf you're underwhelmed, you probably should be. If you're enraged because of questions like -\n\n1. What about the code structure and efficiency?\n2. What about security?\n3. How does this help me implement design patterns into my work?\n\n\\- bear with me.\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I have seen many programmers prioritize the quality of the code over the functionality of the app. I've seen it in practice as well as in conversations/debates amongst programmers. These questions still matter, but their relevance is predicated on how it answers the question of \"Why does this work,\" and/or \"Why doesn't this work?\"\n\nWhat about structure and efficiency? Is that why it does/doesn't work? If the current code structure does not significantly impact the solutions ability to work or not work, then it's a moot question. It's moot, because it has no meaningful bearings on how well the app does its job (or fails to do its job).\n\nFor a personal utility script where the focus is on development efficiency and functionality, not raw execution speed, a few seconds' difference in runtime is inconsequential. So the practical value of a faster script is diminished if it sacrifices development efficiency. Ultimately, **the script's success is defined by whether or not it works as intended.** In that regard, a 'slower' script developed in one hour can be a more pragmatic solution than a 'faster' one that took three hours to build.\n\nNow, I said a lot about strengths and weaknesses of a programmer. So let's take it a step further and address the speed at which coding is done. I, frankly, am not a super fast coder. I'm not the slowest in the room, but I was never the guy who could just churn code like a factory (pattern).\n\nI know, way to show my ass to the crowd. The thing is, I am simply stronger in analysis and communication than I am in writing code. I'm cool with being that guy. I love working with developers who are code factories and don't want to deal with people as much, because that's a complementary counterpart to what I bring to the table. So, while I focus on drafting demos and POCs and diagrams and all of these things about the application, they can focus on the real meat of the application, preventing backdoors, scaling efficiency, obscure mathematical theorems, etc.\n\nHowever, since we are talking about a collaborative environment, it is important to note that this is not a siloed effort. I NEED to write production code because I NEED to understand what goes into it, pitfalls, and tricks. I may be subordinate to the code master next to me, but I cannot circumvent the necessity of actually doing the work. The same goes for the code master. They NEED to create diagrams and explain concepts because they NEED to understand how the customer feels, whether or not their idea can conceptually make sense to another person, and so on. Just like they bail me out if I back myself into a corner, I bail them out if they start fumbling the presentation. It goes both ways, and we both become exceptional for it.\n\n**The True Programmer, and respecting your colleagues**\n\nI know advocating for respect on an internet forum is a quintessential example of \"screaming into the void,\" but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.\n\nJust like how I said we don't know a lot of things, we (as a society) don't know what a true programmer is. Something to do with writing code, something to do with building applications. I'm not here to claim that I have the be-all-end-all answer to what a true programmer is. Quite the opposite.\n\nThe literal definition of a programmer is pretty vague when you look at it from a technical perspective. There's a lot of nuance and layers to writing a computer program that we could spend a long time deliberating over. That is precisely why we must be very careful, or downright avoid, the argument that \"someone who does x\" or \"someone who doesn't know y\" is or is not a \"true programmer.\" Fans of the True-Scotsman fallacy will know exactly what I mean here. It's an argument that leads to nowhere.\n\nThe reality is technology is a part of everyone's life, and everyone's perspective on it matters. We need non-technical users to break our apps and force us to come up with more resilient and intuitive designs. We need semi-technical users to help translate the real world to technical ideas with new and creative inspirations outside of the conventional walls. We need deeply technical users to navigate the gritty details of building the applications when they're 9 layers removed from the original problem. Most importantly, we need all of them to work together to build anything meaningful.\n\nEveryone gets into tech with their own perspective for their own reasons. But what technology is, fundamentally, doesn't change. Whether it's writing a new business integration or starting a SaaS company or building robots or even developing new devices that don't require a plug - the whole idea of technology is rooted in discovery. We take the chaos the world presents us, and learn how to contain it and use it to achieve our goals. Fire became torches, circuits became software, and Maggie became a great lesson for me in what really matters in software.\n\nI hope this post serves as a valuable reminder of all the things we still don't know in software and technology as a whole. I hope it reassures newcomers that it's okay to feel like everything is a hot mess - because it is. I also hope it helps to soothe some of the hardened veterans who know things and learned lessons that the vast majority of society could hardly understand, let alone be expected to know. Finally, I hope it helps everyone make better applications by focusing on what really matters. Whether it's an actual project, or just discussing ideas with a stranger, we should always focus on why it does or doesn't work first, and remember that what is most valuable to us as programmers is not always what's most valuable to the applications themselves.\n\n**P.S. Counter arguments and the importance of taking different approaches**\n\nI am acutely aware that there are many software that are vastly different than the cushy business applications I have come to know. Even banks have a higher tolerance of failure than, say, the technology responsible for safely landing your aircraft. Furthermore, there is a very real snowball effect poorly written code has where tech debt and developer morale go in the wrong directions quickly.\n\nThis is not me advocating for haphazardly writing code and being complacent with what we do not know. If you've got 30 layers of if statements in your method, I'm inclined to believe that you did something wrong and should have fixed it a long time ago. Getting the job done tomorrow matters as well as getting it done today, usually. You'll never solve for everything, so you always try to solve what matters the most first, and there are times that your application can \"get the job done\" today, but should absolutely not see the light of production until it is completely reworked into a sensible architecture.\n\nThe answer to \"Why doesn't this work?\" can very likely be \"Because it's so impossible to understand that we won't know why it fails.\" or \"Because this bug introduces a 0.1% chance that the plane slams into the ground upside down and kills everyone on board.\"\n\nThis is a bit more philosophical, but I am of the mind that you should always have unresolved reasons for why something doesn't work. If you don't, you probably don't know your application very well. This ultimately gets into risk assessment and whether or not the risk/reward is worth it. A tiny risk of a minor issue, like a script running a few seconds slow, may not be worth hours of work. However, a tiny risk of a major disaster, like a plane crash, is unacceptable and must be addressed. Deciding what risks to tackle is a judgment call based on the severity of the potential outcome.\n\nRemember, the definition of what does and does not work varies. You need to be aware of it and set your own standards (at least, as much as you're able to) to ensure that the software you produce is to the quality it needs to be. Knowing the implications of not following a best practice, and accurately determining if it's a meaningful risk, is an extremely delicate decision. You need to know the rules and respect the rules before you go off deciding to intentionally break them.",

I just recently was working on a report generation tool for a friend when, just a week before we needed it to be done, they decided to clarify that certain parts of the report needed to have dynamic labeling and columns when we had already understood them as static elements. As you can imagine, that&amp;#39;s a totally different approach than I had originally planned for. With not enough time to totally rewrite the program, I had a choice:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quickly refactor the code, accept that it&amp;#39;ll be a bit messy, defer proper restructuring, happy client because it works.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ask for an extension to the deadline, customer misses their reporting window, blame them for not being clear and not knowing that information at the beginning?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, of course, asked for the extension. They, of course, denied the request. So, I went with option 1. Why? Because the relationship was more valuable to me than the structure of my code. I will absolutely take on a bit of a messier solution on the backend to secure another future project and ensure the client is happy &lt;strong&gt;in this scenario&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say it&amp;#39;s always the right answer. I have refused to deploy changes that were of security or regulatory concern because not going to jail was more important than winning another project. I&amp;#39;m not even saying I am always right in which options I take for these situations. My point, as highlighted by the title of this section, is that the world around the application matters a LOT. Assuming you would have done it better without knowing all of the context for why those decisions were made is not only unfair to the previous developers, but is simply a conclusion driven by ego.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tying this back to our main theme, you are measuring the quality of the solution based on metrics which are not the goal. The goal was a functional app that satisfied the defined requirements within the allotted timeline. That&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmers have limitations. It&amp;#39;s okay to not be a superhuman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to pivot the focus a bit and talk more about you - the programmer. I&amp;#39;m not going to say that every programmer is an antisocial basement dweller who would never suffer the presence of another human being or (God-forbid) a team building exercise. We know that already (jk).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, there are some INCREDIBLE programmers out there. I&amp;#39;ve seen people who have mastered a multitude of frameworks, seem to 100x processing times every time they touch something, and can build a decent MVP, if given all the info up front, at a break-neck pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, I have also seen programmers who are incredible in a different way. They may be slower on the keyboard, but they do a much better job at diagnosing issues and getting to the root cause of a problem. Some of them are incredible at interpersonal relationship building (very valuable in tech as a programmer, just saying). Some can understand a seemingly limitless amount of complexity and boil things down to a simple direction that everyone understands. I&amp;#39;ve met and managed a few that seemed to be able to do all of it and more entirely on their own (usually 25+ YoE on those guys/gals).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We say this all the time, but I think we forget to take our own advice: Programming is so much more than the code. For every rockstar programmer I have had the pleasure of working with, I could identify several issues working with them. Even the guy who does it all tends to be a victim of their own success and struggles to not dominate the room when collaboration is a must. Everyone has their gaps in knowledge and that&amp;#39;s okay. Programming is an absurdly broad, dense, and deep discipline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say this, because I still see it as a big issue in tech today. I think AI has really inflamed the issue too (I won&amp;#39;t be getting into that) because of how many different ways there are to use this, frankly, very powerful tool. Please, for the sake of your sanity and enjoyment of programming, do not measure yourself OR OTHERS on a single dimension. It is my belief that a pillar of a good programmer is the ability to appreciate solutions and strengths which they do not possess nor understand, and the ability to keep the big picture in mind when addressing a potential weakness in themselves, the solution, or another programmer. Remember, comparison is the thief of joy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What leads to the surrogation of goals in software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it takes a lot of tolerance for uncertainty to work in tech. After all, your job is to essentially invent things that don&amp;#39;t exist yet. Sure, there&amp;#39;s a million pdf parsers out there, but there isn&amp;#39;t one that does EXACTLY what you need the EXACT way you need it. There are 1000s of security camera models out there, but your new camera design (hopefully) taps into something the market is being starved of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, what the hell do you do when something like blockchain hits it big? What if you&amp;#39;re required to use a library you&amp;#39;ve never even heard of? What if Maggie in accounting can&amp;#39;t so much as find the damn Windows start button, yet she&amp;#39;s the VP of your project and wants to know every little technical detail just to ridicule things she doesn&amp;#39;t understand? Dammit Maggie, it&amp;#39;s a REST call! IT&amp;#39;S JUST A....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we hardly have much consensus on what &amp;quot;good code&amp;quot; even is - or the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; way to do it. We had waterfall for some 30 years, then Agile happened, but we still have waterfall and now we have hybrid Waterfall/Agile teams with varying adherence to either paradigm. Sometimes they just make up their own rules and call it Agile because they do stuff on a bi-weekly cadence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, you have Scrum and Kanban muddying the waters. But, you also have standards like TOGAF and ITIL. Let&amp;#39;s also not forget how SaaS providers like Jira have their own rules to abide by. Honorable mention to the books and onslaught of professionals saying &amp;quot;I have figured it out! Buy my shit.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s all before you even get to the framework you&amp;#39;re going to be working in. It&amp;#39;s a freaking mess!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is, we just don&amp;#39;t know what perfect code is. We can generally approximate when code is written poorly or well, and we can loosely articulate the reasons and speculations around that approximation, but we don&amp;#39;t *know* if it&amp;#39;s right except for very specific cases (of which there are still many examples). Nearly everything is up to debate, and it can be really hard to be certain that the code we write is good. Except, it doesn&amp;#39;t need to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventing surrogation of goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ironically, one of the most important lessons I have learned in tech has been from the least technical users I have encountered. I learned that there are two questions that should always be guiding a solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why does this work?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why doesn&amp;#39;t this work?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re underwhelmed, you probably should be. If you&amp;#39;re enraged because of questions like -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What about the code structure and efficiency?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What about security?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How does this help me implement design patterns into my work?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I have seen many programmers prioritize the quality of the code over the functionality of the app. I&amp;#39;ve seen it in practice as well as in conversations/debates amongst programmers. These questions still matter, but their relevance is predicated on how it answers the question of &amp;quot;Why does this work,&amp;quot; and/or &amp;quot;Why doesn&amp;#39;t this work?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about structure and efficiency? Is that why it does/doesn&amp;#39;t work? If the current code structure does not significantly impact the solutions ability to work or not work, then it&amp;#39;s a moot question. It&amp;#39;s moot, because it has no meaningful bearings on how well the app does its job (or fails to do its job).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a personal utility script where the focus is on development efficiency and functionality, not raw execution speed, a few seconds&amp;#39; difference in runtime is inconsequential. So the practical value of a faster script is diminished if it sacrifices development efficiency. Ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;the script&amp;#39;s success is defined by whether or not it works as intended.&lt;/strong&gt; In that regard, a &amp;#39;slower&amp;#39; script developed in one hour can be a more pragmatic solution than a &amp;#39;faster&amp;#39; one that took three hours to build.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I said a lot about strengths and weaknesses of a programmer. So let&amp;#39;s take it a step further and address the speed at which coding is done. I, frankly, am not a super fast coder. I&amp;#39;m not the slowest in the room, but I was never the guy who could just churn code like a factory (pattern).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know, way to show my ass to the crowd. The thing is, I am simply stronger in analysis and communication than I am in writing code. I&amp;#39;m cool with being that guy. I love working with developers who are code factories and don&amp;#39;t want to deal with people as much, because that&amp;#39;s a complementary counterpart to what I bring to the table. So, while I focus on drafting demos and POCs and diagrams and all of these things about the application, they can focus on the real meat of the application, preventing backdoors, scaling efficiency, obscure mathematical theorems, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, since we are talking about a collaborative environment, it is important to note that this is not a siloed effort. I NEED to write production code because I NEED to understand what goes into it, pitfalls, and tricks. I may be subordinate to the code master next to me, but I cannot circumvent the necessity of actually doing the work. The same goes for the code master. They NEED to create diagrams and explain concepts because they NEED to understand how the customer feels, whether or not their idea can conceptually make sense to another person, and so on. Just like they bail me out if I back myself into a corner, I bail them out if they start fumbling the presentation. It goes both ways, and we both become exceptional for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The True Programmer, and respecting your colleagues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know advocating for respect on an internet forum is a quintessential example of &amp;quot;screaming into the void,&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;d be remiss if I didn&amp;#39;t mention it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like how I said we don&amp;#39;t know a lot of things, we (as a society) don&amp;#39;t know what a true programmer is. Something to do with writing code, something to do with building applications. I&amp;#39;m not here to claim that I have the be-all-end-all answer to what a true programmer is. Quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The literal definition of a programmer is pretty vague when you look at it from a technical perspective. There&amp;#39;s a lot of nuance and layers to writing a computer program that we could spend a long time deliberating over. That is precisely why we must be very careful, or downright avoid, the argument that &amp;quot;someone who does x&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;someone who doesn&amp;#39;t know y&amp;quot; is or is not a &amp;quot;true programmer.&amp;quot; Fans of the True-Scotsman fallacy will know exactly what I mean here. It&amp;#39;s an argument that leads to nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is technology is a part of everyone&amp;#39;s life, and everyone&amp;#39;s perspective on it matters. We need non-technical users to break our apps and force us to come up with more resilient and intuitive designs. We need semi-technical users to help translate the real world to technical ideas with new and creative inspirations outside of the conventional walls. We need deeply technical users to navigate the gritty details of building the applications when they&amp;#39;re 9 layers removed from the original problem. Most importantly, we need all of them to work together to build anything meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets into tech with their own perspective for their own reasons. But what technology is, fundamentally, doesn&amp;#39;t change. Whether it&amp;#39;s writing a new business integration or starting a SaaS company or building robots or even developing new devices that don&amp;#39;t require a plug - the whole idea of technology is rooted in discovery. We take the chaos the world presents us, and learn how to contain it and use it to achieve our goals. Fire became torches, circuits became software, and Maggie became a great lesson for me in what really matters in software.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this post serves as a valuable reminder of all the things we still don&amp;#39;t know in software and technology as a whole. I hope it reassures newcomers that it&amp;#39;s okay to feel like everything is a hot mess - because it is. I also hope it helps to soothe some of the hardened veterans who know things and learned lessons that the vast majority of society could hardly understand, let alone be expected to know. Finally, I hope it helps everyone make better applications by focusing on what really matters. Whether it&amp;#39;s an actual project, or just discussing ideas with a stranger, we should always focus on why it does or doesn&amp;#39;t work first, and remember that what is most valuable to us as programmers is not always what&amp;#39;s most valuable to the applications themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. Counter arguments and the importance of taking different approaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am acutely aware that there are many software that are vastly different than the cushy business applications I have come to know. Even banks have a higher tolerance of failure than, say, the technology responsible for safely landing your aircraft. Furthermore, there is a very real snowball effect poorly written code has where tech debt and developer morale go in the wrong directions quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not me advocating for haphazardly writing code and being complacent with what we do not know. If you&amp;#39;ve got 30 layers of if statements in your method, I&amp;#39;m inclined to believe that you did something wrong and should have fixed it a long time ago. Getting the job done tomorrow matters as well as getting it done today, usually. You&amp;#39;ll never solve for everything, so you always try to solve what matters the most first, and there are times that your application can &amp;quot;get the job done&amp;quot; today, but should absolutely not see the light of production until it is completely reworked into a sensible architecture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer to &amp;quot;Why doesn&amp;#39;t this work?&amp;quot; can very likely be &amp;quot;Because it&amp;#39;s so impossible to understand that we won&amp;#39;t know why it fails.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Because this bug introduces a 0.1% chance that the plane slams into the ground upside down and kills everyone on board.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a bit more philosophical, but I am of the mind that you should always have unresolved reasons for why something doesn&amp;#39;t work. If you don&amp;#39;t, you probably don&amp;#39;t know your application very well. This ultimately gets into risk assessment and whether or not the risk/reward is worth it. A tiny risk of a minor issue, like a script running a few seconds slow, may not be worth hours of work. However, a tiny risk of a major disaster, like a plane crash, is unacceptable and must be addressed. Deciding what risks to tackle is a judgment call based on the severity of the potential outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, the definition of what does and does not work varies. You need to be aware of it and set your own standards (at least, as much as you&amp;#39;re able to) to ensure that the software you produce is to the quality it needs to be. Knowing the implications of not following a best practice, and accurately determining if it&amp;#39;s a meaningful risk, is an extremely delicate decision. You need to know the rules and respect the rules before you go off deciding to intentionally break them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "communityName": "r/RocketLeague",
    "parsedCommunityName": "RocketLeague",
    "body": "Since I think hitting C2 or C3 I have made it a point when I rank up to come in and try to share something useful I learned in each rank. However, as the rank goes up, so too does the difficulty of distilling information down so that others can take something useful into their games. While I am not as confident in what I can share from my GC1 experience, I will still do my best!\n\n  \n**Lesson 1 - Get used to rank variance until it doesn't matter.**\n\nLook, the reality is that on a good day I am GC2. On a bad day, I'll probably still get smooshed in C2/C3 gameplay because players are just that good. I will drop back to GC1, and probably back to C2/C3 again - and then I'll climb back up, and then it's like \"uh-oh\" because I want to shake up the gameplay a bit and learn some new stuff. It's gonna happen, it's part of the process, it never stops, get used to it. \n\nYou're not playing to win every game, you're playing to win more games than you lose over 1000+ hours of gameplay if your goal is GC+ and you're not a freak of nature that just naturally gets the game in a few hundred hours. That means you want to lose more games sooner, setting good habits and learning good skills, than you lose by just being silly or tilting or what have you. Worry about if your time is productive, not if you are winning or losing so much. Winning or losing is a symptom of good practice and discipline.\n\n**Lesson 2 - Take breaks. They're not that bad.**\n\nI just got off a few weeks of little to no play not too long ago. I sucked for about a week before I remembered how to do things. I have been on breaks that lasted several months. Just take a break every now and then. Focus more on life, have other hobbies, be a person. I neck-beard this game a lot, but it's a dedicated hobby in my day in which I only have a few hobbies, so I can do that. \n\n**Lesson 3 - Be healthy.**\n\nThis is athletics and competition 101. Take care of yourself. Parlay that with lesson 1 and 2.\n\n  \nAlright, onto the more \"in-game\" stuff.\n\n  \n**Tip 1 - Remain flexible.**\n\nIt's very easy to cement yourself in the \"right\" and \"wrong\" ways to play. Try to be a bit more flexible in what you consider \"right\" or \"wrong\" in a situation. Every decision has its risks and its opportunities. You need to know how to interpret these decisions FOR BOTH in the game. \n\nThat means if you look at your tm8 whiffing and go \"gg we lost\" or start autopiloting back to net, then you failed to read the play. Your tm8 whiffed. What's the ball doing? What's the opponent doing? How can you use the unpredictable touches of your tm8 to your advantage? Be resourceful and don't rely on your tm8. \n\n**Tip 2 - Don't rely on your tm8.**\n\nJust in case you missed it in tip 1. Don't do it. That doesn't mean always play safe. That doesn't mean go for a freaking air dribble flip reset every time you touch the ball. That means be your own player. Play around your tm8. Yes, they can be so bad that you don't win. Whatever, gg, move on. That'll be 1 maybe 2 out of 10 games on average. \n\nHere's the cold water. If it's higher than 1 or 2 out of 10 games where you are getting bad tm8s that are so bad you can't win - you probably just aren't playing well enough. Doesn't matter if you're on a 15 loss streak \"because of tm8s\", I have been there. I get the frustration, I really do. It's not your tm8.\n\n**Tip 3 - Be focused and confident.**\n\nAvoid playing with distractions. I am a musician, I love music, can't play with it though. I pay too much attention to the song and not the game. Don't get caught up on mistakes. Get that ball. \n\nDouble commit? Okay, get that ball. \n\nScored on? Okay, get that ball next play.\n\nLose game? Okay, get that ball next game.\n\nI like affirmations personally. \n\n\"Get that ball.\" - You can't outplay me - I'm beating/dunking you right now.\n\n\"Brick wall.\" - You can't score on me - I'll block every shot.\n\nThese two work for me but you can cope-I MEAN-manage your mental game however you like. Do what works for you.\n\nIt's drastically exaggerated in his content as comedy, but go look at CaseOh play some games. He is relentlessly overconfident no matter how much he loses. Don't go that extreme with it, but be that consistent with it.\n\n**Tip 4 - Just play the damn game.**\n\nFinishing out a 1 to 7 game, even if your tm8 is throwing, is not a waste of time unless you make it one. I don't care if you forfeit (though, I would recommend against it because it's the best way to guarantee a loss), but until the game is done you keep playing your best. \n\nIf you're not playing the game, consider playing the game. Don't shy away from ranked when you hit a new PB, go get that ball dude. \n\n**Tip 5 - Have as much fun as you possibly can.**\n\nI am putting this at the bottom because that's how these things have been written by whole life. But it's not a floaty \"remember to have fun ;D\" tip. I'm dead serious about this.\n\nThe whole point of my affirmations, the biggest improvement I have made since starting coaching, and the best part of my gameplay as a whole since hitting GC1 is I am having so much fun, even when I lose. I still get frustrated, blame my tm8s, whiff easy shots, the whole gambit. I have been doing it for over 1500 hours. \n\nMy least favorite rank was C2. Not because I stayed there for like 5 seasons, but because I had forgotten how to have fun with the game at that point and took things way too seriously. I still take my skill in the game seriously, but the game itself is fun.\n\nThe biggest reason I go for the ball in my games is not because it's the highest % optimal play or because I see some dope vision of a double tap on your forehead. It's because I am sick of waiting and I WANT TO HIT THE F#\\*\\^ING BALL DUDE! It's fun to go for the ball, it's fun to laugh at silly mistakes, and it's fun to watch a tm8 work overtime to carry my heavy ass on my off days (or tilt if they can't). It's also fun to block shot after shot. The game is really fun if you like it and you let it. \n\nAnd, look, if you can't have fun the bottom line remains - go do something else. You're going to suck in the game if you're grumping about anyways because you'll be too fixated on how you feel to focus on what is happening in the game. If that means you play 5 hours a week or less, that's perfect. That may also mean you don't rank up as quickly or as high as you potentially could with more time. That's also just fine. \n\nThis game requires that you think and act quickly and precisely. Each exchange is decided by milliseconds of difference, even in the lower ranks. You need to have fun with it, or you're going to be slow, distracted, and inconsistent. \n\n  \n**Random FAQs for the curious:**\n\nHrs/week - \\~20\n\nTraining - Some training packs. Coaching. Some custom maps. Nothing too concrete. 3hrs a week.\n\nCar - Fennec (it doesn't matter as long as the car feels good to you)\n\nTotal hours - a little less than 2k.\n\nTotal time in GC1 - \\~1 year",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I think hitting C2 or C3 I have made it a point when I rank up to come in and try to share something useful I learned in each rank. However, as the rank goes up, so too does the difficulty of distilling information down so that others can take something useful into their games. While I am not as confident in what I can share from my GC1 experience, I will still do my best!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 1 - Get used to rank variance until it doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, the reality is that on a good day I am GC2. On a bad day, I&amp;#39;ll probably still get smooshed in C2/C3 gameplay because players are just that good. I will drop back to GC1, and probably back to C2/C3 again - and then I&amp;#39;ll climb back up, and then it&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;uh-oh&amp;quot; because I want to shake up the gameplay a bit and learn some new stuff. It&amp;#39;s gonna happen, it&amp;#39;s part of the process, it never stops, get used to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re not playing to win every game, you&amp;#39;re playing to win more games than you lose over 1000+ hours of gameplay if your goal is GC+ and you&amp;#39;re not a freak of nature that just naturally gets the game in a few hundred hours. That means you want to lose more games sooner, setting good habits and learning good skills, than you lose by just being silly or tilting or what have you. Worry about if your time is productive, not if you are winning or losing so much. Winning or losing is a symptom of good practice and discipline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 2 - Take breaks. They&amp;#39;re not that bad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just got off a few weeks of little to no play not too long ago. I sucked for about a week before I remembered how to do things. I have been on breaks that lasted several months. Just take a break every now and then. Focus more on life, have other hobbies, be a person. I neck-beard this game a lot, but it&amp;#39;s a dedicated hobby in my day in which I only have a few hobbies, so I can do that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 3 - Be healthy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is athletics and competition 101. Take care of yourself. Parlay that with lesson 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, onto the more &amp;quot;in-game&amp;quot; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 1 - Remain flexible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very easy to cement yourself in the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; ways to play. Try to be a bit more flexible in what you consider &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; in a situation. Every decision has its risks and its opportunities. You need to know how to interpret these decisions FOR BOTH in the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means if you look at your tm8 whiffing and go &amp;quot;gg we lost&amp;quot; or start autopiloting back to net, then you failed to read the play. Your tm8 whiffed. What&amp;#39;s the ball doing? What&amp;#39;s the opponent doing? How can you use the unpredictable touches of your tm8 to your advantage? Be resourceful and don&amp;#39;t rely on your tm8. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 2 - Don&amp;#39;t rely on your tm8.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just in case you missed it in tip 1. Don&amp;#39;t do it. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean always play safe. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean go for a freaking air dribble flip reset every time you touch the ball. That means be your own player. Play around your tm8. Yes, they can be so bad that you don&amp;#39;t win. Whatever, gg, move on. That&amp;#39;ll be 1 maybe 2 out of 10 games on average. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the cold water. If it&amp;#39;s higher than 1 or 2 out of 10 games where you are getting bad tm8s that are so bad you can&amp;#39;t win - you probably just aren&amp;#39;t playing well enough. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re on a 15 loss streak &amp;quot;because of tm8s&amp;quot;, I have been there. I get the frustration, I really do. It&amp;#39;s not your tm8.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 3 - Be focused and confident.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Avoid playing with distractions. I am a musician, I love music, can&amp;#39;t play with it though. I pay too much attention to the song and not the game. Don&amp;#39;t get caught up on mistakes. Get that ball. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Double commit? Okay, get that ball. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scored on? Okay, get that ball next play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lose game? Okay, get that ball next game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like affirmations personally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get that ball.&amp;quot; - You can&amp;#39;t outplay me - I&amp;#39;m beating/dunking you right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Brick wall.&amp;quot; - You can&amp;#39;t score on me - I&amp;#39;ll block every shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These two work for me but you can cope-I MEAN-manage your mental game however you like. Do what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s drastically exaggerated in his content as comedy, but go look at CaseOh play some games. He is relentlessly overconfident no matter how much he loses. Don&amp;#39;t go that extreme with it, but be that consistent with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 4 - Just play the damn game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finishing out a 1 to 7 game, even if your tm8 is throwing, is not a waste of time unless you make it one. I don&amp;#39;t care if you forfeit (though, I would recommend against it because it&amp;#39;s the best way to guarantee a loss), but until the game is done you keep playing your best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not playing the game, consider playing the game. Don&amp;#39;t shy away from ranked when you hit a new PB, go get that ball dude. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 5 - Have as much fun as you possibly can.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am putting this at the bottom because that&amp;#39;s how these things have been written by whole life.

I have played \\~20 games since then and noticed the vast majority of my tm8s were actually quite defensive. HOWEVER, I did observe many cases where they were defensive but inconsistent - meaning they'd go for a really risky shot, miss touches, or just not do anything super productive with the ball. \n\nI got serious with RL right when Flakes did his classic \"Road to GC with no mechs\" series and carried the sentiment that most RL players in C3 and below (even reaching into GC, honestly) are just ball chasers. This really held me back because I would often play MORE defensive to try and balance the aggression, when in reality I was just totally off on reading my tm8 and actually needed to ramp up the aggression and solo play because the opponents were using the extra space for their counter attacks.\n\nThis does NOT mean you should go into your games and start ballchasing, even if you notice your teammate is playing defensively. It's still a situational game and you have to make your decisions based on the situation.

I'm finding that most players at C3+ are actually trying to read the play and think things through, they're just hesitant or inconsistent. That's OKAY. We can play around inconsistent teammates by recognizing their behaviors, what they are playing for, and adjust our approach to try and feed into their playstyle while mitigating risk of a counter attack. \n\nStill no magic bullet, still impossible to win a game if your tm8 can't find some impact and you're not popping off.

    "body": "Alright I have spent about 6 hours on this app but I did this all today using Gemini. I'll try to give a comprehensive breakdown of what you're seeing, how it works, and how I intend to use this. Hopefully it inspires others out there to think of more ideas like this one.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\n**What is this? -** This is an application for my personal use. I am able to take receipts and order details from grocery stores I shop at and update a persisting inventory of items I have. I am then able to \"checkout\" items as I consume them and be alerted when I am low in stock or when items are about to expire (based on last ordered date).\n\n**Why is this? -** I hate managing my groceries and remembering what I have, how much, and when it was ordered. Plus, I intend to get a cheap tablet that I can put the application on and use as a home tablet.\n\n**Was this necessary? -** Probably not. But I'm excited about it. \n\n# Technical Stuff\n\n**Overall Architecture -**\n\n* A single html file (oh yeah, baby...just bear with me) for front-end. This file can be used on mobile and desktop devices with a browser.\n* 1 n8n workflow - connects the html file to the \"database\"\n* 1 Google App Script (GAS) - handles any updates to the inventory (process order, process checkout, et al.) every minute\n* 1 google sheet with \\~6 tabs - the \"database\"\n\n  \nOkay, you stuck with me this far. This architecture sounds like total trash, but I intentionally made it this trash for a reason.\n\n  \nI wanted to restrict my application's complexity to a level where it was as easy as possible to modify with Gemini and avoid hallucinations. This is not \"vibe\" coding. I am actively reviewing the code and ensuring the AI remains between the lines. However, I wanted an architecture that was dirt cheap and used elements that were familiar even to people who were not from a developer background. That meant no SQL databases and, due to how canvas works, using a single html file.\n\nThe \"developer\" tools I used for this process were VS Code to easily review and update code, and Python to host a local server when testing. \n\nI developed the n8n workflow using all standard elements. This part was super easy to anyone familiar with the tool. \n\nGAS and HTML/JS/CSS were all drafted and updated by Gemini 2.5. \n\n# The Experience\n\nI'll be honest, I work with Salesforce in my day-to-day work. This kind of app with this kind of architecture was the most mind-bending experience I have gone through since I began developing 10 years ago. \n\nThe original design started with just the html file and GAS. However, I learned that GAS has issues with CORS and burned about an hour in that rabbit hole. This was the only issue where Gemini wasn't clearly indicating to me that it may be a platform issue and got stuck desperately changing the code to try and fix the problem. Once I realized the issue was with GAS and Gemini would not find a suitable workaround, I transitioned to n8n as the middleware between the html and google sheet.\n\nVisual design was surprisingly easy. It wasn't \"accurate\" per se. The original visual design I had in mind was a more glassy UI. But I was very happy with how this turned out.\n\nFunctionality in GAS and the HTML file were pretty easy - save for the CORS issue I mentioned. 2.5 is significantly better at handling code than all previous models. This was a great part of the experience.\n\nOne caveat I need to point out is that, because I come from a technical background, I was able to quickly understand and navigate issues faster than someone who is not comfortable with code and technical jargon. While this process was relatively easy for me - I would not expect someone who is non-technical to have nearly as easy a time. \n\n# The Result\n\nLet's be clear. This is NOT an application I would be able to put on the internet or distribute to others safely/easily. Anything beyond me and only me running this application would have some pretty real security questions involved. \n\nBut, I am happy enough with it to put it on my own personal devices and use it that way. With this app I am able to\n\n  \n1. See my current stock of food/ingredients\n\n2. Take note of any items that are nearing expiration or are low in stock\n\n3. Checkout items which are consumed or discarded\n\n4. Process online orders and receipts into the inventory\n\n5. Filter the display by tags (either clicking on the tags in the displayed items or typing them in)\n\n\n\n# What's Next\n\n  \nThis is the first fully functional integrated app I have been able to produce with this approach. My hope is to build a suite of personal applications for myself that make life easier. However, this one still needs some refinement in how it processes orders (still a bit manual) and it is yet to be seen how well expanding the app's functionality will work in the future. I am particularly interested in how I can use this to generate shopping lists automatically.",

    "body": "I just recently saw a demonstration of Manus in a news update style video. The person in the video explained that Manus \"hands control of the VM over to (the user) to login.\"\n\nThis immediately raised some red flags in my head. My understanding is that, when I input my password into Manus, they are necessarily storing and processing that password. Even if Manus stays on the up-and-up, it bothers me that my unmasked password is being sent outside of my local machine, especially if it's at all unencrypted for that portion of the transaction. That's before we get to the standard data retention questions.\n\nIt's totally possible that Manus had already considered and handled these gaps - but it's new tech and I worry that, if this experience becomes the norm, it will open a LOT of people up to Manus competitors who just build a barely functioning app as a phishing attempt.\n\nIf someone has more information on how exactly Manus handles this, I'd be curious to know. And, in the larger scope of AI technology, I think the Manus UX raises some important considerations for how future cyber attacks and scams could manifest. I'd be curious to hear what others think.\n\n  \nEDIT: Wasn't sure if links were allowed. Here's the YT video I mentioned in the beginning of my post - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwTMuFvSQtw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwTMuFvSQtw) he shows a tech stack breakdown (high level) at minute 5",

(mandatory)\n* Replaceable button AND trigger/bumper modules (preferred)\n* Comfortable\n* Performance (Accurate inputs, minimal delays, etc.)\n* Adapative Triggers (preferred)\n\n&gt;Games you'll be playing\n\n* Rocket League (vast majority of gameplay)\n* Hell Let Loose\n* Helldivers 2\n* RPGs\n\n&gt;Other controllers you're comparing to\n\nMy last purchase was a Victrix Pro BFG. It was pretty great for the first couple months. Stick drift eventually hit and I ordered the replacement modules. Then things turned south pretty quick.\n\nFirst, the package was rejected because the post office found nothing in the package. I gave Victrix benefit of the doubt, because who knows what happened, and just opened a support ticket explaining the issue and asking for my options to fix the issue. \n\nWithout any prior communication, other than an automated acknowledgement, they processed a full refund and instructed me to reorder the product. The email with the instructions to reorder I, admittedly, missed. \n\nHowever, I did not find this very satisfactory either way. At no point did I approve a refund, nor did I find the solution of waiting another 4 days very fair as a consumer, especially when you didn't even talk to me before assuming you knew what I wanted. \n\nTo their credit, they escalated my request, immediately responded to all of my questions clearly, and offered expedited shipping (literally worth more than the modules themselves), but a good faith discount on my next purchase. Frankly, that's pretty great customer service. Sure, it would've been nice to start there, but I believe everyone deserves a fair chance and I think this was plenty to give them a pass, in my opinion.\n\nBut, sadly, the left bumper had also worn out and there was no replacing it. I did have the option, at this point, to submit for repair under warranty. But, frankly, I was pretty fed up with the process. I would rather void the warranty and try to fix it myself, than open another ticket, ship the controller to them, have them ship it back 4 weeks later (or however long it takes), when I could just buy a replacement controller at Wal-Mart in 20 minutes. Long story short, there was no way that button was getting fixed on my time. \n\nI suppose the other option I should have considered was a backup controller. But, overall, I just wasn't impressed with my Victrix experience. Hats off to the woman in customer support that handled my case, but the rest was meh. The controller was comfy but an absolute pain to clean because of how the palm pads were designed (little tiny ridges in a checkered pattern). It worked....fine? Obviously, the durability was far less than what I desired for the price (\\~$200 all in). \n\nI am really clueless when it comes to the controller market, and don't have much time these days to try and learn quickly. Even now I am writing this while on my lunch break at work haha. But, I would like to find a suitable controller - as I have heard of many options and would think there is a better alternative than stock Sony controllers.\n\nHopefully my experience with Victrix will also help inform others if they happen to consider that route. Overall, wouldn't recommend unless you have some patience with customer service and highly recommend buying a backup controller in case one breaks early. Had I done that, I may have been less frustrated with the outcome of my experience.",

I learned how to dip out of a bad situation when I accidentally chose a contract that put my MkIII up against an anaconda. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The play cycles are really nice too. A solid 30 minute session and a little bit of luck on the mission board and you can clear out 8-12 contracts and make some really good progress on the hangar which feels so rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far, I have stayed comfortably within ~100Ly area. With my Vulture more-or-less maxed out pre-engineering wise, my next plan is to get an ASP Explorer and get to work on engineering while I save up for something around the 50m range to add to my collection.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "communityName": "r/domesticviolence",
    "parsedCommunityName": "domesticviolence",
    "body": "**----Leaving the Abuse----**\n\nWhen I was 21 I left my abusive relationship. I was hospitalized in the psych ward during the relationship after an argument had me shoeless and dissociating to a point I was very scared for what I might do. They put me on Zoloft which helped stabilize my emotions enough to not dissociate during her outbursts.\n\nI left after an argument where I knew she was gaslighting me turned into her throwing me onto the ground, the fall breaking my wrist. Thankfully, it was a clean break and no surgery was required. Her case was dismissed by the grand jury. I'll never forget the prosecutor saying, \"You did great. It's the system that failed you. Just because they dismissed the case, doesn't mean it didn't happen. I'm sorry.\"\n\nThis was only a month-ish after the incident and it still didn't really click what exactly had happened to me. I remember calling my sister for the first time and relearning what it was like to see the trees move in the wind, because I hadn't left the house in 2 years except for work and groceries. I drank my first beer alone at a bar, said about 3 words to the bartender but she made me smile which was nice. \n\nThe entire first 3 months was just a blur. I had no money so my house got foreclosed. Well, the filed foreclosure 3 days before the contract for sale was executed. Another horseshit gotcha in the system but at least I got it sold. I wrote a lot of music in this time, dove into another relationship with a childhood friend, and allowed my career to consume me entirely. Looking back, I think I was so overwhelmed and stunned I just never quite found the right footing.\n\nThis relationship was marginally better, but quickly deteriorated into a similar pattern. No physical violence but the drinking and adultery grew over time. This went on for 4 years. I ended it when she aggressively banged on the bedroom door. My mother, who lived nearby, came to pick me up and I gave her a week. This one was easier than the first, but only because my brain never really left that space. It was just like a loop, an instant replay. But this time, I didn't hit pause, I hit stop.\n\n**----Descending into Hell----**\n\nA few weeks later she had moved out and was working towards recovery. We remained friends and I kept hope that she would recover. But, I also knew I had slipped back into the same pattern myself and needed to figure it out. I had just landed a really good job so I invested every dollar I could into my diet/fitness/mental health. This started 9 months of utter hell for me.\n\nEvery day I was bedlocked. I averaged \\~1200-1500 calories a day. Some days as low as 500 or even skipping the day. I had depressive episodes that would tie my stomach into knots and last up to 6 hrs. I don't remember working in that time, but I was. I don't know really know how. I lost my pets, 3 dogs, but I got to keep my cat. My house became infested with gnats to the point that I could no longer sleep in my bedroom (it was making me sick) and I could feel the gnats hitting the blanket I was under on my couch. 2-4pm was the worst time for it. I slept when I could, but I didn't have a schedule for it. \n\nEvery single day it just got worse for those 9 months. I stopped even going to the drive-thru to get food because I just couldn't suffer the act of moving to the car and back. I was too occupied digging through layer after layer of horrible memory, unresolved trauma, every insult and strike. My mantra was \"there has to be a bottom to this.\" That was the hope I clung to every day for 9 months. It fucking sucked. \n\nI could write a book about my experiences, and maybe one day I will. But for now, that much detail will hopefully suffice. At the end of the 9 months I woke up one day and it wasn't worse. I didn't have another \"layer\" of misery to discover. It was just as bad that day as it was yesterday. Now, you need to be pretty low for a long time to see \"it's not worse\" as that great of a thing but to me it was everything. I finally got proof that there is indeed a bottom to this massive web of trauma and confusion. I called up my therapist and we got to work.\n\nIt took me a whole month to take a shower. I had no clean clothes, no towels, no soap. So we started there. It took me a few weeks but I got the nerve to hit the store. I was still experiencing daily depressive episodes, and some days I did find another layer which totally knocked me out for the day. But I kept waking up the next day, and if I felt the ability to do ANYTHING other than lay in bed I did it. Hell, some days I would stand up randomly just to lay back down because that's what I had in me.\n\nOnce the shower hit, I zeroed in on my diet. I have ADHD and my flavor includes the \"picky eater\" DLC where I can't eat a lot and I usually have to eat what I crave. But I found a smoothie recipe that worked with my diet and 2 months after the pivot I consumed 2,000 calories in a single day for the first time in almost a year. I cried like a little baby. To me, this was the next proof, I was getting better.\n\n**----Licking The Wounds----**\n\nProgress afterwards was mostly steady. Some days were harder than others, but slowly the depressive spells began to ease and my sense of reality became more stable. I moved to a better job and while work still consumed most of my time - it wasn't nearly as bad as before. I also refused to seek any commitments in this time. It took another whole year for it to happen, but eventually my depression went into remission and has stayed there since. \n\nThere were some challenges too. I did become interested in a few people, but I kept firm lines and leaned on my therapist to help stay rational about the situation. I am proud to say I did not commit to either of them and recognized the same red flags that I wish I had seen in the prior relationships. I was able to take a friend in and help him out as well. I started going out and making friends again. Slowly but surely I was resembling my true self again.\n\n**----Today----**\n\nIt's not all gone today. My habits are still pretty jacked up, work is a bit of an obsession, and I have lingering anxiety issues all over the place. They did reduce my CPTSD to PTS which is another great sign, and I am going to keep tackling habits and anxiety with the same ferocity. \n\nIt's been really, really hard. Even the good things can hurt a lot. I have become more sentimental in this time, relearning that it's okay to care. It comes out in things like recently when I heard a song my sister plays on piano a lot. Took me back to before it all when we were sitting in the living room listening to her play. It's good stuff, man. But it's still a bit confusing and painful at times. I'll never trade that again.\n\nI've also met a wonderful lady. Been since May, and she treats me really well. She's got her shit together, good family, compassionate, she's what I want. I continue to approach with caution, and she's been nothing but understanding and supportive. \n\n**----Reflection----**\n\nI don't really know why I was compelled to write this today, or why I chose here. One of the things I learned in this time is that I want to take my experiences with abuse and help others who are in it to get out, and those who are not in it to avoid it. \n\nI don't hate my abusers - I think that kind of mentality actually interfered with my recovery because I never had any animosity or desire to see them as anything but people. I have learned to recognize that they are people I loved who are mentally ill. And sometimes, mental illness means we need to hold them at a distance. Sometimes, that means for life. And that's okay. I'm not responsible for them, I can't be. They need to heal their own way, just like I healed my own way.\n\nIf I could go back to myself before these relationships, I'd reassure myself that it's okay to leave if you're worried about abuse in the relationship. You don't need to wait for proof or wait for it to make sense. It's your brain and your instinct trying to tell you something isn't right. It's really good at that stuff, so trust yourself.\n\nIf I could go back to myself during these relationships, I'd say it's okay to leave. No, you can't guarantee what it looks like and yes it's terrifying. You don't know what's gonna happen when you leave. But you DO know what will happen if you stay - and you deserve better than that. So love yourself enough to leave.\n\nI hope this message reaches someone in a meaningful way. And I hope regardless of this message, if you need help, I hope you find it. Much love.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;----Leaving the Abuse----&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 21 I left my abusive relationship. I was hospitalized in the psych ward during the relationship after an argument had me shoeless and dissociating to a point I was very scared for what I might do. They put me on Zoloft which helped stabilize my emotions enough to not dissociate during her outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left after an argument where I knew she was gaslighting me turned into her throwing me onto the ground, the fall breaking my wrist. Thankfully, it was a clean break and no surgery was required. Her case was dismissed by the grand jury. I&amp;#39;ll never forget the prosecutor saying, &amp;quot;You did great. It&amp;#39;s the system that failed you. Just because they dismissed the case, doesn&amp;#39;t mean it didn&amp;#39;t happen. I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was only a month-ish after the incident and it still didn&amp;#39;t really click what exactly had happened to me. I remember calling my sister for the first time and relearning what it was like to see the trees move in the wind, because I hadn&amp;#39;t left the house in 2 years except for work and groceries. I drank my first beer alone at a bar, said about 3 words to the bartender but she made me smile which was nice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire first 3 months was just a blur. I had no money so my house got foreclosed. Well, the filed foreclosure 3 days before the contract for sale was executed. Another horseshit gotcha in the system but at least I got it sold. I wrote a lot of music in this time, dove into another relationship with a childhood friend, and allowed my career to consume me entirely. Looking back, I think I was so overwhelmed and stunned I just never quite found the right footing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This relationship was marginally better, but quickly deteriorated into a similar pattern. No physical violence but the drinking and adultery grew over time. This went on for 4 years. I ended it when she aggressively banged on the bedroom door. My mother, who lived nearby, came to pick me up and I gave her a week. This one was easier than the first, but only because my brain never really left that space. It was just like a loop, an instant replay. But this time, I didn&amp;#39;t hit pause, I hit stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;----Descending into Hell----&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later she had moved out and was working towards recovery. We remained friends and I kept hope that she would recover. But, I also knew I had slipped back into the same pattern myself and needed to figure it out. I had just landed a really good job so I invested every dollar I could into my diet/fitness/mental health. This started 9 months of utter hell for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day I was bedlocked. I averaged ~1200-1500 calories a day. Some days as low as 500 or even skipping the day. I had depressive episodes that would tie my stomach into knots and last up to 6 hrs. I don&amp;#39;t remember working in that time, but I was. I don&amp;#39;t know really know how. I lost my pets, 3 dogs, but I got to keep my cat. My house became infested with gnats to the point that I could no longer sleep in my bedroom (it was making me sick) and I could feel the gnats hitting the blanket I was under on my couch. 2-4pm was the worst time for it. I slept when I could, but I didn&amp;#39;t have a schedule for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every single day it just got worse for those 9 months. I stopped even going to the drive-thru to get food because I just couldn&amp;#39;t suffer the act of moving to the car and back. I was too occupied digging through layer after layer of horrible memory, unresolved trauma, every insult and strike. My mantra was &amp;quot;there has to be a bottom to this.&amp;quot; That was the hope I clung to every day for 9 months.

    "body": "\\*\\*For context - this is a project I was called in to as an emergency resource. Basically, come fix our mistakes...anyways...\n\n\n\nOh yeah. Just found this one recently. One transaction runs 170 lines of code to verifying the creation of a single record across 3-4 classes.\n\nThe total line count of those classes and their corresponding test class is just over 8,300 lines of code. One of the classes on its own is over 2400. I saw a method that had over 300 lines just on its own. What a trooper.\n\nThe first kicker (maybe not, there's a lot of great stuff in here....8 layer if else statements....) \n\nOkay, one of my favorites is that the big mama class is a global class and is integrated with an external system. This system, as evident by dozens of unnecessary permission checks, can have multiple users hitting this class at the same time.\n\nThat's a real problem because -every- -single- -method- is static and \\*\\*THE SOURCE RECORDS ARE STORED AS GLOBAL STATIC VARIABLES\\*\\*\n\nFor those who may be unaware or just unfamiliar, \"static\" means that there cannot be multiple instances of that variable even if multiple \"things\" are referencing that method/variable. In other words, if you have two requests come in at the same time - you could very easily end up swapping the source records mid process and corrupting the data on one or both sets of data. And you would never know because, while corrupted, all the data is likely still in a valid format and will pass through the system without a system error. Kind of a big deal when it's directly associated to every deal in your sales process.\n\nBut the thing that really prompted me to post this was such a level of \"I don't care about the next guy\" that I am actually stunned.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;**For context - this is a project I was called in to as an emergency resource. Basically, come fix our mistakes...anyways...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah. Just found this one recently. One transaction runs 170 lines of code to verifying the creation of a single record across 3-4 classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The total line count of those classes and their corresponding test class is just over 8,300 lines of code. One of the classes on its own is over 2400. I saw a method that had over 300 lines just on its own. What a trooper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first kicker (maybe not, there&amp;#39;s a lot of great stuff in here....8 layer if else statements....) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, one of my favorites is that the big mama class is a global class and is integrated with an external system. This system, as evident by dozens of unnecessary permission checks, can have multiple users hitting this class at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a real problem because -every- -single- -method- is static and **THE SOURCE RECORDS ARE STORED AS GLOBAL STATIC VARIABLES**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who may be unaware or just unfamiliar, &amp;quot;static&amp;quot; means that there cannot be multiple instances of that variable even if multiple &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; are referencing that method/variable. In other words, if you have two requests come in at the same time - you could very easily end up swapping the source records mid process and corrupting the data on one or both sets of data. And you would never know because, while corrupted, all the data is likely still in a valid format and will pass through the system without a system error. Kind of a big deal when it&amp;#39;s directly associated to every deal in your sales process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the thing that really prompted me to post this was such a level of &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care about the next guy&amp;quot; that I am actually stunned.

    "body": "Looking for a quick collection on getting a good first touch. I think it's easy to plan for first touches in Freeplay because there's no one to pressure the ball, but in a game you could have a lot more speed and craziness which makes it pretty difficult to not smack the ball away or play too slowly and get beat. Also happy to hear feedback on what I've learned and where I can improve my approaches. \n\nA few I can contribute:\n\n1. If going fast, use the wheels for a softer touch. Usually one of the front wheels is pretty good for maintaining control. Necessary for air catches especially when going at speed. \n\n2. Use walls to keep the ball close and hard to read. You can get a lot of one touch outplays by simply hitting the ball against the wall and turning with it. Can be a bit risky though, if they get a good read it's an easy dunk. \n\n3. Pay attention to the orientation of the opponents cars if they're close to the play. Ideally, if you have to hit the ball towards an opponent you send it high over them, behind them, or at least beside them. Anything to make it hard for them to catch and regain possession. Essential for outplays as well. \n\n4. A heavy touch on defense is great in dangerous situations. If rotation gets awkward or boost gets low just send the ball. BUT DONT PUSH TOO FAR! The opponent will likely still have possession after. Just grab boost and position defensively. Only follow hard if it beats the second man, is awkward for the opponent, or you know you're getting a clean follow up. \n\n5. If the opponents are rotating back and you can't get a quick shot on net, slow it down. Play to steal and drain their boost. A hard \"test\" shot may go in but it'll be saved at higher levels. A lot of times it's better to let the ball slow down and take a light touch to force one of the defenders out. \n\n6. Shoot fast. If your first touch is a shot, just take the shot. Be wary of shooting as second man, a bad shot can be an easy counter for them with no one back. \n\n7. Keep visibility. A lot of players touch the ball in a way that turns the camera from the opponent. This is fine if you use your right stick to check, but you need to be wary. Often times, if you lose visibility, just going for a quick follow up touch is good enough. \n\n8. If they're challenging and you have the beat, take the beat. Yes if you get a soft touch passed them it's better but the timing can be very difficult and I see a lot of players losing their chance because they tried too hard to keep control. Just beat the one and move the play down the field as quickly as possible to pressure the 2nd. Be mindful of fakes though.\n\n9. Hitting the ball to the side, unless there's an opponent positioned there, is often safer than towards the center. You may not see them challenging or mistake how much boost they have. A hit to the side makes it harder for them to turn a dunk into a shot. Centering the ball anywhere is a gamble, remember that it is centered for both nets. Whoever gets the ball first very well may score. \n\n10. If you're low boost with possession, keep the ball in a position where you can quickly 50 the ball. Going for a dribble can be risky as the flip from a flick will likely over commit you. If you're confident in your ability to get a good flick, by all means. But there's a period of time where a good opponent with good positioning can easily take you out of the play. Also, it's usually pretty easy to read because you have to cut the ball first. Anytime their first man sees you cut the ball they're probably going to challenge and try to shut down the flick as quickly as possible. ",

I don't see any dramatic differences in my gameplay, and I have tried several different play styles to see if anything gets knocked loose - but to no avail.\n\nThe 2 common issues I am seeing in my gameplay (at least, ones that I don't know the answer to) are shadow defense and a dead ball. \n\nOn shadow defense, it feels like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Opponent will carry the ball on top of their car and simply flick on my net. I am like...brain dead on how to stop this when the opponent clearly has a first touch and makes it a good one. If I challenge, it goes over me. If I fake challenge, they don't flick, unless I overcommit on the fake. It feels like I consistently make the wrong decision in the scenario and I am totally lost on how to make the right decisions here.\n\nOn a dead ball, it feels like they just out position me I guess? It feels like after a 50 I am always the slowest back to the ball. And we run into a similar theme. If I fake, they fake, if I go left, they cut and go right. \n\nI realize they're just playing offense. But it feels like I literally cannot make the right decisions on defense and they can just hit it around me however they like.\n\nNot to be that guy who blames his problems on other things - but I am also wondering if this is partly a tech issue. I consistently have moments where the ball goes through my car, is hovering in front of the opponent's car, and lags around during a fifty. Strangely, the game has also started \"jumping\" during my matches. It looks like a rubber banding type of issue where things hang for just a split second and then jump forward. It's almost unnoticeable until I notice it then it's incredibly annoying.\n\nI also usually see a packet loss indicator momentarily during the game. This is newer behavior to me and I am wondering if I am playing further behind the game. My ping is usually 45-65 though, so I am not sure.",

It feels like I consistently make the wrong decision in the scenario and I am totally lost on how to make the right decisions here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a dead ball, it feels like they just out position me I guess? It feels like after a 50 I am always the slowest back to the ball. And we run into a similar theme. If I fake, they fake, if I go left, they cut and go right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize they&amp;#39;re just playing offense. But it feels like I literally cannot make the right decisions on defense and they can just hit it around me however they like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to be that guy who blames his problems on other things - but I am also wondering if this is partly a tech issue. I consistently have moments where the ball goes through my car, is hovering in front of the opponent&amp;#39;s car, and lags around during a fifty. Strangely, the game has also started &amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot; during my matches. It looks like a rubber banding type of issue where things hang for just a split second and then jump forward. It&amp;#39;s almost unnoticeable until I notice it then it&amp;#39;s incredibly annoying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also usually see a packet loss indicator momentarily during the game. This is newer behavior to me and I am wondering if I am playing further behind the game. My ping is usually 45-65 though, so I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Solo Q'ed into the rank.\n\n**Hrs per week -** 10-20, most of it in ranked games and playing in free play while waiting.\n\n**Warm up routine -** none unless I feel like it. I just hit the ball around a little waiting for queue and warm up in the game.\n\n**Coaching -** Minimal. I did a defensive seminar from an SSL and watched a lot of youtube over the years. Once I hit champ it was more about getting better at doing the right thing, not learning what the right thing is. But I try to pay attention to any shifts in the meta.\n\n**Playstyle -** Passive/Defensive primarily. \n\n**Thoughts...**\n\nWell, I'm 27 this Friday and I finally did it. I hit that ol' GC rank. I probably won't stick around for long, the games are hardcore to say the least but I at least know I have it in me now. I wanted to take a bit to talk about the game and hopefully give some tips to others reaching for the big red from the perspective of someone who just freshly got it. I want to try and talk mostly about champ gameplay since I haven't played a game yet as a GC.\n\nFirst bit of advice is you don't need to stop soloing your journey, but you need to accept what soloing means. You will have more diverse teammates. Some are better and will carry the whole game, some are worse and can't hit the ball to save their life. The fix for this is absolute humility. You have had games when you were getting beat and whiffing easy hits. You know it. Let them have theirs. If you want the next rank while soloing you need to be able to carry enough that the teammates on bad days don't tank you rank. \n\nSecond, mechanics are important. I've all but avoided mechanical play until champ when I realized **why** mechanics are important. I can't flip reset and I'm lucky to get a double tap in game (I'm really good at missing the tap by a hair though). Even my ground game isn't super consistent. The reason I think mechanics are important is because the game is often decided by the touches BEFORE a play starts. To hit GC you need to be able to aim the ball (not just slam it anywhere) and you need to pay more attention to the opponents than the ball itself. You will be punished 8/10 times if you accidentally pop the ball or bang it off your corner. These aren't just routine shots in high champ, they're flat out giveaways. C3s are decent enough to put the ball where a defender can't reach them most of the time. \n\nNot only do you need to avoid the whiffs and bad touches, you need to make your good touches at speed. That means knowing which part of the car to use, the angle to hit the ball for a follow up, etc. All of this is too much to think about while you're playing, so you need to get so good at it that you don't think about it. Again, you're going to be looking at the opponent and reacting to their movement. You don't have time to whip out your protractor and calculate the best touch.\n\nThird, mistakes and bad touches will happen all the time. A bit contradictory to my last statement, but even at this level I'd say most touches are pretty pointless. That doesn't mean the player isn't capable of slamming that ball top right if you give them time to correct after their bad touch, but giving away the ball, missing the shot, and having the ball fly god knows where after you accidentally scoop it is just part of the game. Don't get mad at yourself (or your teammate) if it's happening a lot. It's going to happen a lot. Laugh it off and move on.\n\n**Experience with Smurfs and boosted accounts**\n\nI don't follow the narrative that the game is absolutely riddled with smurfs. I play plenty, and there have definitely been days when it felt like every other game had a little blue guy in one of the cars. But, honestly, it's not that bad in my experience. I can't speak for any of the lower ranks since I have been at least c2 for 3-4 seasons now. But, I found most games I played were pretty well balanced. There's a stark difference between a champ having a bad game and someone who was boosted from a lower rank. The champ is usually there for the play and just accidentally back flips or misses by a little bit. A boosted diamond simply isn't there for the play half the time. Likewise, a smurfing GC2 is way different than a champ having a good game. Their positioning is going to be so far ahead of your play that you can't get anything started, meanwhile a champ having a good game is likely going to have to fight for the ball and simply win their 50s and outplays more.\n\nIn any case, I would recommend a perspective which I recently adopted. Instead of thinking of your rank as people who are exclusively your rank, think of it like a distribution. 70-80% are probably in the right rank, with 20% boosted/smurfing. There isn't a way right now which guarantees everyone is the rank they're supposed to be, but for the most part it does well. Your goal isn't to beat every &lt;insert rank here&gt; every time. If you get a smurf in your game or a boosted teammate, play it out first. A high champ can beat a GC2 sometimes. I usually let the game go 4-5 goals behind and less than 2 minutes before I even consider FF. I can't count how many times I was down 3 goals in the first minute and came back to win. Most of those games, I got the early FF notification and it's just routine now for me to ignore them.\n\n**Toxicity in the community**\n\nThis will influence your gameplay and enjoyment of the game. While I think it's absolutely ridiculous to get upset over car ball, especially as a grown ass man....hell I think it's a bit ridiculous for a grown ass man to play the game as much as I do BUT ANYWAYS...\n\nI do get annoyed very easily by toxic chat in the game. I can get confrontational so I just turned off chat. I can still tell if they're tilting through car language but you learn to not let that get to you. I highly recommend turning off the chat. There's just not enough moderation in the current state to make it meaningful to the grind. It's a distraction at best, and a hinderance at worst.\n\n**Getting better at the game**\n\nThere's probably 100 different things I could recommend to any given player. I'm working on a ton of things myself. But, I think the same pillars remain true for gold players that are true for champ players. Play the game and focus on your gameplay. Every single game I verbally call out what I did wrong when I get scored on. Force of habit, but it's what I do. I also call out what my teammate did wrong to myself, so I can be sure I am aware of what's happening. Whatever works for you is great. Acknowledge, adjust, and move on. If your adjustment doesn't work, try something else until it does work. Remember what worked, and next time you're in that situation see if it still works. Over time, you'll learn what you need to do to adjust to players who are faster, more mechanical, and teammates who are slower, chasier, etc. It takes time and focus, so keep at it.\n\n**Mentality**\n\nA lot of people say Rocket League is a mental game and that's true to an extent. I don't think you need to have a hyper confident attitude to win, but I do think you need to have a strong resolve when you're losing and avoid cockiness when you're winning. If you're winning, win more. Don't slow down 2 goals ahead, keep going until they're ground into the dust and not playing anymore. Then you can chill. If they start playing again, crush them again. If you're losing and your teammate is tilting, remain neutral. It might be an L, so start experimenting. Can you get to those challenges faster? Can you dodge your teammate's bump and still get the save? Your games are all made of those little moments, so if you're going to lose you might as well practice and keep getting better. Eventually, you'll be good enough that it doesn't happen as much and you can pull your tilted teammate out of the gutter with a sick solo play.\n\n**The most important skill**\n\nIn my experience, the absolute most important skill by far is your ability to read the play. Again, most of the time nothing important is happening so you don't need to challenge. But, when you do decide to challenge you need to recognize that, in the higher ranks, you're likely challenging while they still have control. You need to challenge in a way that doesn't over commit you and you need to predict what their reaction is going to be to cover options. There's a lot of nuance to challenges that I don't see discussed very often. It's a bit hard to articulate for me, so maybe it is for the coaches out there as well. \n\nDon't overthink it though, as you drive up look at what your opponent could do and challenge somewhere between their option to do nothing and their option to outplay you. Lastly, expect them to absolutely thrash you and prioritize your recovery over anything. I would say the vast majority of my challenges are fakes anyways, most challenges just aren't worth it and it's a lot easier to disrupt them in the corner, clear off the backboard, or go for a goal line save. \n\nReading also includes reading bounces. You gotta be able to get up for that ball before it hits the wall if you want to beat the opponent in the higher ranks. Jump at where you think the ball will be approximately and adjust as you figure it out. You'll get better in time.\n\nLast note on challenging and reading the play and getting better in general. Make the mistakes in ranked. It's a non-linear progression. You need to understand the difference between \"right decision, poor execution\" and \"wrong decision\" in your games. If you're making the wrong decisions, you're going to hit a ceiling at some point and make it way harder for yourself. If you're making the right decisions and just whiffing the ball, that's fine. Keep making that decision and practicing that decision. \n\n**Final Thoughts...**\n\nI still enjoy the game and am having fun playing it. I'm not super active in the community and don't totally care to be. I think a lot of people overthink their rank issues when the baseline is and always will be the same. If you want a higher rank, get better at the game. I know that's super crass and underwhelming, and I don't want to minimize the real issues the game has. But, that's really it at the end of the day. This game is really hard and, especially in higher ranks, players will absolutely punish you for small mistakes. The only way to win is to play a better game than your opponent. The only way to do that is to practice and enjoy the journey of getting better.\n\nThat's all I've got. I hope this long post is helpful to someone out there. Knowing my playing, I'll see you back in c2 in just a day or two haha!",

Solo Q&amp;#39;ed into the rank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hrs per week -&lt;/strong&gt; 10-20, most of it in ranked games and playing in free play while waiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm up routine -&lt;/strong&gt; none unless I feel like it. I just hit the ball around a little waiting for queue and warm up in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coaching -&lt;/strong&gt; Minimal. I did a defensive seminar from an SSL and watched a lot of youtube over the years. Once I hit champ it was more about getting better at doing the right thing, not learning what the right thing is. But I try to pay attention to any shifts in the meta.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playstyle -&lt;/strong&gt; Passive/Defensive primarily. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m 27 this Friday and I finally did it. I hit that ol&amp;#39; GC rank. I probably won&amp;#39;t stick around for long, the games are hardcore to say the least but I at least know I have it in me now. I wanted to take a bit to talk about the game and hopefully give some tips to others reaching for the big red from the perspective of someone who just freshly got it. I want to try and talk mostly about champ gameplay since I haven&amp;#39;t played a game yet as a GC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First bit of advice is you don&amp;#39;t need to stop soloing your journey, but you need to accept what soloing means. You will have more diverse teammates. Some are better and will carry the whole game, some are worse and can&amp;#39;t hit the ball to save their life. The fix for this is absolute humility. You have had games when you were getting beat and whiffing easy hits. You know it. Let them have theirs. If you want the next rank while soloing you need to be able to carry enough that the teammates on bad days don&amp;#39;t tank you rank. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, mechanics are important. I&amp;#39;ve all but avoided mechanical play until champ when I realized &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; mechanics are important. I can&amp;#39;t flip reset and I&amp;#39;m lucky to get a double tap in game (I&amp;#39;m really good at missing the tap by a hair though). Even my ground game isn&amp;#39;t super consistent. The reason I think mechanics are important is because the game is often decided by the touches BEFORE a play starts. To hit GC you need to be able to aim the ball (not just slam it anywhere) and you need to pay more attention to the opponents than the ball itself. You will be punished 8/10 times if you accidentally pop the ball or bang it off your corner. These aren&amp;#39;t just routine shots in high champ, they&amp;#39;re flat out giveaways. C3s are decent enough to put the ball where a defender can&amp;#39;t reach them most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only do you need to avoid the whiffs and bad touches, you need to make your good touches at speed. That means knowing which part of the car to use, the angle to hit the ball for a follow up, etc. All of this is too much to think about while you&amp;#39;re playing, so you need to get so good at it that you don&amp;#39;t think about it. Again, you&amp;#39;re going to be looking at the opponent and reacting to their movement. You don&amp;#39;t have time to whip out your protractor and calculate the best touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, mistakes and bad touches will happen all the time. A bit contradictory to my last statement, but even at this level I&amp;#39;d say most touches are pretty pointless. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean the player isn&amp;#39;t capable of slamming that ball top right if you give them time to correct after their bad touch, but giving away the ball, missing the shot, and having the ball fly god knows where after you accidentally scoop it is just part of the game. Don&amp;#39;t get mad at yourself (or your teammate) if it&amp;#39;s happening a lot. It&amp;#39;s going to happen a lot. Laugh it off and move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience with Smurfs and boosted accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t follow the narrative that the game is absolutely riddled with smurfs. I play plenty, and there have definitely been days when it felt like every other game had a little blue guy in one of the cars. But, honestly, it&amp;#39;s not that bad in my experience. I can&amp;#39;t speak for any of the lower ranks since I have been at least c2 for 3-4 seasons now. But, I found most games I played were pretty well balanced. There&amp;#39;s a stark difference between a champ having a bad game and someone who was boosted from a lower rank. The champ is usually there for the play and just accidentally back flips or misses by a little bit. A boosted diamond simply isn&amp;#39;t there for the play half the time. Likewise, a smurfing GC2 is way different than a champ having a good game. Their positioning is going to be so far ahead of your play that you can&amp;#39;t get anything started, meanwhile a champ having a good game is likely going to have to fight for the ball and simply win their 50s and outplays more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case, I would recommend a perspective which I recently adopted. Instead of thinking of your rank as people who are exclusively your rank, think of it like a distribution. 70-80% are probably in the right rank, with 20% boosted/smurfing. There isn&amp;#39;t a way right now which guarantees everyone is the rank they&amp;#39;re supposed to be, but for the most part it does well. Your goal isn&amp;#39;t to beat every &amp;lt;insert rank here&amp;gt; every time. If you get a smurf in your game or a boosted teammate, play it out first. A high champ can beat a GC2 sometimes. I usually let the game go 4-5 goals behind and less than 2 minutes before I even consider FF. I can&amp;#39;t count how many times I was down 3 goals in the first minute and came back to win. Most of those games, I got the early FF notification and it&amp;#39;s just routine now for me to ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxicity in the community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will influence your gameplay and enjoyment of the game. While I think it&amp;#39;s absolutely ridiculous to get upset over car ball, especially as a grown ass man....hell I think it&amp;#39;s a bit ridiculous for a grown ass man to play the game as much as I do BUT ANYWAYS...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do get annoyed very easily by toxic chat in the game. I can get confrontational so I just turned off chat. I can still tell if they&amp;#39;re tilting through car language but you learn to not let that get to you. I highly recommend turning off the chat. There&amp;#39;s just not enough moderation in the current state to make it meaningful to the grind. It&amp;#39;s a distraction at best, and a hinderance at worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting better at the game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s probably 100 different things I could recommend to any given player. I&amp;#39;m working on a ton of things myself. But, I think the same pillars remain true for gold players that are true for champ players. Play the game and focus on your gameplay. Every single game I verbally call out what I did wrong when I get scored on. Force of habit, but it&amp;#39;s what I do. I also call out what my teammate did wrong to myself, so I can be sure I am aware of what&amp;#39;s happening. Whatever works for you is great. Acknowledge, adjust, and move on. If your adjustment doesn&amp;#39;t work, try something else until it does work. Remember what worked, and next time you&amp;#39;re in that situation see if it still works. Over time, you&amp;#39;ll learn what you need to do to adjust to players who are faster, more mechanical, and teammates who are slower, chasier, etc. It takes time and focus, so keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people say Rocket League is a mental game and that&amp;#39;s true to an extent. I don&amp;#39;t think you need to have a hyper confident attitude to win, but I do think you need to have a strong resolve when you&amp;#39;re losing and avoid cockiness when you&amp;#39;re winning. If you&amp;#39;re winning, win more. Don&amp;#39;t slow down 2 goals ahead, keep going until they&amp;#39;re ground into the dust and not playing anymore. Then you can chill. If they start playing again, crush them again. If you&amp;#39;re losing and your teammate is tilting, remain neutral. It might be an L, so start experimenting. Can you get to those challenges faster? Can you dodge your teammate&amp;#39;s bump and still get the save? Your games are all made of those little moments, so if you&amp;#39;re going to lose you might as well practice and keep getting better. Eventually, you&amp;#39;ll be good enough that it doesn&amp;#39;t happen as much and you can pull your tilted teammate out of the gutter with a sick solo play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most important skill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the absolute most important skill by far is your ability to read the play. Again, most of the time nothing important is happening so you don&amp;#39;t need to challenge. But, when you do decide to challenge you need to recognize that, in the higher ranks, you&amp;#39;re likely challenging while they still have control. You need to challenge in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t over commit you and you need to predict what their reaction is going to be to cover options. There&amp;#39;s a lot of nuance to challenges that I don&amp;#39;t see discussed very often. It&amp;#39;s a bit hard to articulate for me, so maybe it is for the coaches out there as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t overthink it though, as you drive up look at what your opponent could do and challenge somewhere between their option to do nothing and their option to outplay you. Lastly, expect them to absolutely thrash you and prioritize your recovery over anything. I would say the vast majority of my challenges are fakes anyways, most challenges just aren&amp;#39;t worth it and it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to disrupt them in the corner, clear off the backboard, or go for a goal line save. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reading also includes reading bounces. You gotta be able to get up for that ball before it hits the wall if you want to beat the opponent in the higher ranks. Jump at where you think the ball will be approximately and adjust as you figure it out. You&amp;#39;ll get better in time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last note on challenging and reading the play and getting better in general. Make the mistakes in ranked. It&amp;#39;s a non-linear progression. You need to understand the difference between &amp;quot;right decision, poor execution&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wrong decision&amp;quot; in your games.

If you&amp;#39;re making the right decisions and just whiffing the ball, that&amp;#39;s fine. Keep making that decision and practicing that decision. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still enjoy the game and am having fun playing it.

Maybe it&amp;#39;s just a perception thing but it honestly feels like if a pro boosts from stop they could get to supersonic faster than me even if we agreed to not jump/flip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that&amp;#39;s technically not true since all the cars accelerate the same, just curious what I might be missing in my play that would make such a dramatic difference in boost usage and speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "I think the last and only AC game I played was 3. It was...alright. Didn't totally love it but didn't hate it either. It just gave me a headache to play it. With all the hype around 6 I figured \"what the hell\" and on a bit of a hard-game high from Remnant 2 it felt right. \n\nOverall, I had a blast with this game. Designing my mech was hella fun and I'm constantly doing little tweaks to my primary mech both cosmetically and functionally to dial in my playstyle and maximize its capabilities. I run a close-range reverse-joint build with some plasma missiles, a shotgun, and the lance. Building and tweaking, as expected, was easily the best part of this game.\n\nI also felt the difficulty of the game was satisfactory for the most part. Most bosses got me at least once or twice before I sorted them out and killed them. There weren't a lot of cheesy losses to missions like overly rushed time segments or dying to poor camera angles which was great. If I lose, I like it to be because I got outplayed and not cheesed by the game.\n\nThat being said, there were some really bogus moments in this game I hope to see them dial in a bit more. I'll wrap these in the spoiler tag to be safe.\n\n&gt;!Balteus, CEL 240, and Balteus AGAIN. These 3 bosses were not fun. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!The first Balteus fight I was prepped for because I watched some gameplay before I purchased it. I knew it'd be kinda booty so I just toughed it out and got through it in a little under an hour. It wasn't an awful fight but I definitely felt a little annoyed that the game so suddenly demanded me to have mastered my understanding of the dodge mechanics and how enemies can track and react to your inputs. 6/10 on this one just for the beginner punishment. Not too bad.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!CEL 240 was a -insert every insult in the book here-. Okay, they got me with the phase 1 to phase 2. That was really well executed, I almost never fall for that shit but he was hard and phase 1 felt on par with the previous few bosses in difficulty. REALLY well done there. But phase 2 and this guy's constant running away with pinpoint timing required to counter him was absolutely maddening. It seemed like he was the perfect counter to my build and I was only able to beat him after 2 hours and getting lucky enough to pin him against the wall. I found his large laser beam attack pretty frustrating but at least manageable after 30 minutes of practice. But the sword attacks I could not and still do not understand. I could dodge them at medium-long range just fine but he had an uncanny ability to use them when I was at close range which, I am pretty sure, makes them unstoppable. This goes double for the x-sword attack he does. Tack on that he'll often follow one sword combo with another if it connects and it's basically a stun-lock kill for him. Really frustrating boss. The visuals were pretty dope though. 4/10!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The second Balteus fight was probably my least favorite of the whole game. I already dislike reusing bosses in games for the most part. I think there was good potential here because that \"Oh fuck this guy again\" moment is sort of entertaining. But, once the fight starts, any hope of that entertainment persisting is dashed. He's even spongier than the first time, and the alert sound of his laser attack is off. Normally, the two beeps get off with a half second before the attack fires. With this attack, the attack comes just barely after the second beep. Unless you have really good vision on him (which can be impossible at times) you're essentially left without any warning and the attack will hit because dodging here is very precise. It also messes with the muscle memory of that audio queue which I don't like. I have to imagine this is a bug/oversight and would be corrected in the future. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!His second phase is even more ridiculous. The stream of electric shock therapy behind him basically rendered my normal build useless. I don't have the AP to spare and his circular motions really hindered any approach angles for a close-range build. I didn't like doing it, but at this point and so shortly after the CEL 240 battle I was out of patience. I tanked up, put on the shoulder plasma shotguns, double triggered the miniguns, and just DPS raced him. 3 tries later I (barely) won. Not fun. 2/10!&lt;\n\n&gt;!There's some other not so amazing parts of the game. Arena was really fun but felt a bit too easy compared to the main story. I think only one or two mechs gave me trouble throughout it and it didn't feel very linear in difficulty. The S rank was a bit of a joke but that may have just been how my build works. Online play looks pretty dead and underwhelming. Would've loved to see some co-op online play as well but I think that's a generally underexplored game mode. I also didn't notice the little box that indicates a decision in the story line or that I could hear the briefing of a mission before committing until I was most of the way through the game.

You quickly get enough to fund any build of any kind you want if you're willing to resell and rebuy equipment.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the last and only AC game I played was 3. It was...alright. Didn&amp;#39;t totally love it but didn&amp;#39;t hate it either. It just gave me a headache to play it. With all the hype around 6 I figured &amp;quot;what the hell&amp;quot; and on a bit of a hard-game high from Remnant 2 it felt right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a blast with this game. Designing my mech was hella fun and I&amp;#39;m constantly doing little tweaks to my primary mech both cosmetically and functionally to dial in my playstyle and maximize its capabilities. I run a close-range reverse-joint build with some plasma missiles, a shotgun, and the lance. Building and tweaking, as expected, was easily the best part of this game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also felt the difficulty of the game was satisfactory for the most part. Most bosses got me at least once or twice before I sorted them out and killed them. There weren&amp;#39;t a lot of cheesy losses to missions like overly rushed time segments or dying to poor camera angles which was great. If I lose, I like it to be because I got outplayed and not cheesed by the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, there were some really bogus moments in this game I hope to see them dial in a bit more. I&amp;#39;ll wrap these in the spoiler tag to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Balteus, CEL 240, and Balteus AGAIN. These 3 bosses were not fun. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;The first Balteus fight I was prepped for because I watched some gameplay before I purchased it. I knew it&amp;#39;d be kinda booty so I just toughed it out and got through it in a little under an hour. It wasn&amp;#39;t an awful fight but I definitely felt a little annoyed that the game so suddenly demanded me to have mastered my understanding of the dodge mechanics and how enemies can track and react to your inputs. 6/10 on this one just for the beginner punishment. Not too bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;CEL 240 was a -insert every insult in the book here-. Okay, they got me with the phase 1 to phase 2. That was really well executed, I almost never fall for that shit but he was hard and phase 1 felt on par with the previous few bosses in difficulty. REALLY well done there. But phase 2 and this guy&amp;#39;s constant running away with pinpoint timing required to counter him was absolutely maddening. It seemed like he was the perfect counter to my build and I was only able to beat him after 2 hours and getting lucky enough to pin him against the wall. I found his large laser beam attack pretty frustrating but at least manageable after 30 minutes of practice. But the sword attacks I could not and still do not understand. I could dodge them at medium-long range just fine but he had an uncanny ability to use them when I was at close range which, I am pretty sure, makes them unstoppable. This goes double for the x-sword attack he does. Tack on that he&amp;#39;ll often follow one sword combo with another if it connects and it&amp;#39;s basically a stun-lock kill for him. Really frustrating boss. The visuals were pretty dope though. 4/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;The second Balteus fight was probably my least favorite of the whole game. I already dislike reusing bosses in games for the most part. I think there was good potential here because that &amp;quot;Oh fuck this guy again&amp;quot; moment is sort of entertaining. But, once the fight starts, any hope of that entertainment persisting is dashed. He&amp;#39;s even spongier than the first time, and the alert sound of his laser attack is off. Normally, the two beeps get off with a half second before the attack fires. With this attack, the attack comes just barely after the second beep. Unless you have really good vision on him (which can be impossible at times) you&amp;#39;re essentially left without any warning and the attack will hit because dodging here is very precise. It also messes with the muscle memory of that audio queue which I don&amp;#39;t like. I have to imagine this is a bug/oversight and would be corrected in the future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;His second phase is even more ridiculous. The stream of electric shock therapy behind him basically rendered my normal build useless. I don&amp;#39;t have the AP to spare and his circular motions really hindered any approach angles for a close-range build. I didn&amp;#39;t like doing it, but at this point and so shortly after the CEL 240 battle I was out of patience. I tanked up, put on the shoulder plasma shotguns, double triggered the miniguns, and just DPS raced him. 3 tries later I (barely) won. Not fun. 2/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;There&amp;#39;s some other not so amazing parts of the game. Arena was really fun but felt a bit too easy compared to the main story. I think only one or two mechs gave me trouble throughout it and it didn&amp;#39;t feel very linear in difficulty. The S rank was a bit of a joke but that may have just been how my build works. Online play looks pretty dead and underwhelming. Would&amp;#39;ve loved to see some co-op online play as well but I think that&amp;#39;s a generally underexplored game mode. I also didn&amp;#39;t notice the little box that indicates a decision in the story line or that I could hear the briefing of a mission before committing until I was most of the way through the game. It was a pleasant surprise but I wish I would&amp;#39;ve known earlier. I might have missed a tutorial on that, admittedly, but it didn&amp;#39;t feel clear to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Lastly, the balance of money in the game felt a bit trivial after the first couple chapters.

Hopefully someone out there find this helpful!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Get to know cheesy openings and how to counter them -**\n\nWayward Queen, Fried Liver, Scholar's Mate. These are the three most common openings I see that try to go for an early mate or big material gain. They don't have the most intuitive responses for beginners but aren't that hard to learn and punish. If you memorize the first 3 moves and their defense then you'll be pretty well set to at least reach mid-game with some developed pieces and fight back with more \"real chess\". I don't see these less often at 800 than I did at 300.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chess is as much a game of strategy/calculation as it is pattern recognition**\n\nFor example, the fried liver attack uses the bishop and knight to attach the f or c pawn and attempt a fork to win the rook. This can also show up 10 moves into a game. There are some tricky mate in 1 scenarios as well that you need to learn the patterns for. Thankfully, there are plenty of tools which are free that help you learn these patterns. Though I play on chess(dot)com I found the Lichess training resources to be favorable (and free).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bots don't teach you how to punish mistakes**\n\nI played against bots for a while in the beginning because I was nervous to go into rated matches. It's basically a waste of time. They generally play solid chess and then all of a sudden are blundering a queen for no reason. Humans don't generally play that way. Most of the mistakes people make are not seeing the bishop can take a piece from across the board or miscalculating attackers/defenders. I would not advise practicing with bots very much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pick an opening for each color and run with it**\n\nI like the scotch game for white and a simple mirror and defend with the knight for black. Again, most people at this level don't know lines beyond the first few moves and won't know how to adjust an opening to counter your opening. You're both kinda just playing what you like until there's enough tension on the board for someone to do something or someone blunders a piece. Don't try to learn 20 different openings or stress over which one to play. Pick one and master it or until you get bored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Use the engine**\n\nNot in game, that's cheating. Use it after both wins and losses to see where you messed up and where you got lucky. Try not to mess up, try not to be lucky. I usually take 3-4 minutes every few games to poke around and see what happened and what I could have done better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This range is all about being familiar with chess**\n\nI don't know how to mate with a knight and bishop. I barely know any theory. I have a half decent recognition of simple mating patterns. That's really it. Most of what I have learned has been from experiencing games and getting punished for poor board vision, miscalculations, and general carelessness. I don't know that there's a specific lesson that could teach this better than just playing the game. Every now and then I get a cool strategy going or make an awesome move but really, the majority of the games I win are just punishing mistakes. Board vision is almost certainly the top of the list on beginner skills to learn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Play it out, always**\n\nI think this is both good for your elo and just a mark of good sportsmanship. If you blunder your queen, don't give up. I had one game recently where my opponent cleverly trapped my queen in the midgame. It was an excellent play and I thought for sure I'd lost but he blundered rook in the end game and I came away with a win. I've also had the reverse happen to me several times. Play it out. Go for the draw if you're really losing. If you can't win, you can still try not to lose.\n\nI'll add to this that your end game is an incredibly important skill to practice and you don't get many chances. Most games end by resignation or with early mates. Even if it's a for sure loss, getting some experience in the end game will be incredibly helpful when you play a close game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Have fun with the lower ranks. They're chaotic and hilarious**\n\nOverall, don't try too hard, and I think that goes for any level of any game. Just have fun with it. I still donate my queens to the opponent every now and then and laugh about how dumb of a move that was. That's how you'll learn not to do that and practice good awareness in the game.",

They&amp;#39;re chaotic and hilarious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, don&amp;#39;t try too hard, and I think that goes for any level of any game. Just have fun with it. I still donate my queens to the opponent every now and then and laugh about how dumb of a move that was. That&amp;#39;s how you&amp;#39;ll learn not to do that and practice good awareness in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "communityName": "r/ADHD",
    "parsedCommunityName": "ADHD",
    "body": "This is month 13 on a long and arduous journey to improve my mental and physical health. I was diagnosed with ADHD in January of last year alongside a re-diagnosis of CPTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and speculated ASD. I went through a tough breakup in March of '22 and have been living alone since. Today, I cleaned my whole house. It's not perfect, but it's a huge victory and I wanted to share my story thus far. The timeline starts immediately following my breakup because I knew I had to start prioritizing my health if I was going to survive the fallout.\n\n**0-3 Months**\n\nLots of depression. Total bedlock and only eating fast food (if I even ate). The house quickly became a mess. I'm talking 6-7 trash bags worth of garbage, old food waste and dirty dishes abound. I started therapy and was prescribed Strattera. I am someone who mostly avoids psychiatric medication but will resort to it if the bottom falls out beneath me. This was definitely that sort of time. I was not showering, no clean clothes, nothing. It marks one of the lowest points I have ever been in my life. Not the lowest, but top 5 for sure.\n\nIn this time, I worked with my therapist primarily on the smallest and simplest habits I possibly could. While I have had several years of CBT it felt like I was starting from a flat zero. It took me a month to get a shower. I got a nice haircut and journaled a little bit. I also began picking up one piece of trash a day. Lastly, I moved into my living room. My bedroom was too mangled to be remotely healthy to live in and I didn't have the fortitude to fix it just yet, so I relocated to the living room and began sleeping on the couch. While it was a mess in the living room, it was better and I could focus on throwing just one piece of trash away a day. \n\nAt the end of three months things were still pretty dire but I had the smallest bit of momentum to work with. I was able to socialize again and made a few friends. This was the greatest success in the first three months. I was deeply ashamed of my house and home life, but I felt pride in seeing my friends and singing karaoke every week. I had a light to hold on to and I was no longer bedlocked.\n\n**4-6 Months**\n\nStill a lot of depression. Sleeping on the couch isn't exactly the most fun. But, my cleaning habit was getting better. I called up on some family to support me and we did a run on the house together. It wasn't perfect, but a lot of the trash was picked up and the dirty dishes were put into the sink. The house was not clean, but it wasn't a living tragedy either. I pushed a few directions in my diet and made some progress but it didn't quite stick. This time period was a lot of pushing and falling back. Progress would be made and then quickly lost. My depression was no longer constant but still prominent and reliably cyclical - every 2 weeks.\n\nIn this time, I focused on coping skills and dealing with overwhelm. Everywhere I looked there was an overwhelming problem. I had to keep my job which required travel at the time. I had to keep up with the living room so I didn't compromise the only relatively clean space I had in my house. I had to keep my social life going. Everything was too much. \n\nAt the end of 6 months I was pretty low. It felt like everything I did kept getting wiped out. But I kept my shower habits and social habits. I didn't realize the progress I was making yet. Slowly, I was getting better at fighting back against the depression, anxiety, and overall resistance I felt with the world. Each victory was progress and I would soon realize that the list of ways I could be cut down by my problems was indeed finite - not limitless. But boy was I low. I had also come to realize that I was incredibly dependent on external validation and the pursuit of love. I won't dive into the details and stories of how that progressed over this time period, but I'll touch on it later.\n\n**7-9 Months**\n\nA notable shift in my awareness. Problems were happening just as often as before, but new problems weren't. It was usually the same story I had seen before. Anxiety about taking the trash out because the cold was intimidating. Distraction by video games and online videos. Exhaustion from a god awful sleep schedule. I was beginning to understand how all of these things were playing together and realizing how often I overthink my issues. This was the push to stop thinking and start doing.\n\nIn this time, I stopped taking Strattera. While I was still quite low I felt I had the clarity to see my problems and solve them. Since I had not been taking it for a long time, it wasn't really a problem to stop. The first week was rough but it quickly improved thereafter. I began pushing more against the resistance my mental illnesses were giving me. It was a brute force tactic that worked for a good bit of time. I got a lot of the dishes washed and redecorated my living room - the first bit of redecoration since my breakup. The living room was entirely clean, top to bottom. I implemented some house tricks to get things more friendly to my ever distracted mind. I was punching in all directions as hard as I could.\n\nHowever, it did come with a price. At the end of 9 months I got blasted with a major burnout episode. I suddenly couldn't do anything. My depression hit me like a freight train and I watched for weeks as I saw the cleanliness fade, the bedlock (or couchlock) return, and I started to isolate again. I just didn't have the energy to sustain everything I was doing. Thus, it all fell apart. At the end of 9 months, the house looked almost identical to the mess it was in month 0. I was mortified. I felt trapped and hopeless. Frustrated at myself. I didn't understand how I could fight so hard for 9 months just to end up back at square one.\n\n**10-12 Months**\n\nFeeling desperate and defeated, I spoke to my therapist about this. She's usually just there to reflect my thoughts back to me so I can sort them out but this time I really needed some guidance because I was lost. She encouraged me to, instead of try one coping mechanism as hard as I could, to try several and see if one works better in that moment than another. She also pointed out that I had very rigid thinking. What I thought were practical and rationalized thoughts were really quite negative perspectives. Around this time I had some timely conversations with a good friend who pointed out something very similar to me relevant to the dependency on others I had mentioned. He said \"You don't need to provide value or entertainment for us (our friends) to enjoy your company. You being here is enough.\" I still don't comprehend that statement. I really don't. But it woke me up a bit.\n\nIn this time, I focused on flexibility. Instead of pushing in one direction until I got the outcome I was looking for, I started pushing in different directions if for no reason than to challenge myself to move against the inertia of my own thoughts. I did things out of order because why not? I negotiated, bargained, sometimes pleaded with myself to get something done. I did things not because I wanted to or needed to, I did them because I wanted to do something other than what my brain wanted to do.\n\nThis was a whole different movement. It wasn't a bang of a revelation - but a slow burn that to this day I am cautious of. The house got cleaner, not because of some concerted effort to clean - but because I was just cleaning more. I was thinking less and doing more. I can't pinpoint any specific transition that caused it, it just started happening. I would feel the weight of shame hit me and know I needed to do something. Sometimes the impulse was to play video games and so I would say \"okay but clean first\" or \"take a shower first\" or \"take out the trash first\". I even started wanting to clean and I would say \"Okay but do some dishes first\". I would introduce small barriers between me and what I wanted to do so that the things I wanted to do were rewards, not impulses. The depression cycle shifted from 2 weeks to a month. Something was changing. While the house and habits had fallen down, my rebound was much faster. I got the house and habits stabilized in just 1.5 months instead of 6 like before. I wasn't back to square one, I was stronger as a person and more capable than before. It was working....I think? At least I was finally sleeping in my bed again.\n\n**13 Months**\n\nI got a text from my landlord offering a smaller living space near by. It's cheaper and easier to maintain so I said hell yes. While moving is an arduous process, I felt it was exactly what I needed. The catch was, it's in a month. Yikes. I kept pushing but not making a huge amount of progress. Rather, I wasn't making progress fast enough. Things were getting better, I was starting to exercise a bit and I wasn't eating takeout food anymore - but those things weren't directly preparing me to move and I needed the direct motion.\n\nThen, yesterday, she asked if she could come do a quick walkthrough since they had plans to do renovations after I move out. Oh fuck. There's 7-8 trash bags still on my porch. I missed garbage this week so the bins are full. There's trash and clutter inside the house still. Oh fuck. I felt the overwhelm kick in. This wasn't something I could just brute force - even with that ADHD hyperfocus it'd just be too much. There were logistical challenges that came from having to move all that clutter. \n\nI panicked a bit and called my mom. In part, I was hoping she could come out and help me brute force it but I wasn't going to ask. I really just needed to talk it out and center myself. She was supportive and helped me steel myself for the effort. I needed a plan. I didn't need perfectly clean, but clean enough. I needed to be flexible, but I needed to be unwavering as well. I won't lie I procrastinated most of the day. But in the evening, after a long nap, I knew I had to do something. \n\nFirst problem was the smell of messiness. I had to go to the store and get some candles. I didn't need every room to smell divine forever, just for the hour the landlord was here. I also needed some contractor bags to quickly pack away clutter and trash. \n\nSecond problem was the trash. This one took some creativity. The place I am moving into is a considerable (and welcomed) downsize from my current abode. I used the carpenter bags as cover, mixing stuff I am getting rid of with straight up trash and moved it all to the dilapidated garage that they'll be tearing down anyways. Mixing move out stuff with trash and concealing it in opaque black bags was good enough for me to pass as \"moving clutter\" and eek by.\n\nThird was the organization. Certain personal items should not be out in the open for the world, or your landlord, to see. It's not anything illegal or lease breaking, but appearing organized and well put together is important. The relationship matters. I basically turned into an 8 year old. Hide anything that isn't organized. Under the bed, under the couch, in a drawer, whatever. Flip the cutting board in the sink over the dishes to hide the build up of grime. She's not here to critique my lifestyle, she's here to plan her renovations. Use those hidden areas to my advantage.\n\n**Today**\n\nAfter throwing the last bag of garbage into the garage I did a quick run through. I remembered to close the door to the garage and on my way back inside I see her car in my driveway. With no time to spare, I had done the best I could. It was far from perfect, but I think it was passable. Didn't matter, the time had come whether I was ready or not. I just had to cross my fingers and hope for the best. \n\nI gave her a warm welcome and talked to her in the yard for a bit. This was good. If she had seen the porch yesterday it would've been a nonstarter. The fact that she hadn't flipped out on me was a good sign and bought me time to set a positive connotation for the walkthrough. While we waited for her contractor to arrive I preemptively struck at the weaknesses in my plan. I am using the garage to store things I am getting rid of explains the 8 bags of crap that are just inside the door. We complained about the basement together, which I had totally missed in my plan but at least we could say it was a tragedy together. I told her about the few small improvements I had made to the house to demonstrate commitment to the value of the home. Lastly, we talked about the door that likely needs to be replaced since my ex broke it in a fit of alcohol induced rage. So far so good.\n\nThe contractor arrives and they ask permission to go inside. I give my most confident invitation inside and pray the scented candles and febreeze air freshener spray held strong. We'd know the moment they walk in the door if they reel back from the stench of cat. I watched her open the door and cross the threshold. No pause, and a gentle smile. We did it boys. I walk in afterwards and confirm with my own nose that everything is looking and smelling good enough. Again, this house isn't perfect. There's still some small things here and there that are out of place but it's doing okay. She isn't pausing anywhere which is great. \n\nThey do their walkthrough and step outside to get to the attic. I see her meandering alone and take the moment to invite her back in to discuss if she wanted to keep the fan in the living room which I had replaced, or if she wanted me to hook up the original. This was her moment to say any \"Oh by the way, wtf\" things. None of that. Looking good.\n\nThey continue on, come back in once more and hit some of the weaker areas of the house. The mudroom (which is crap anyways) has some old garbage in it. The basement, as I said, not so great. The garage, well big pile of bags and crap. I don't know that she loved seeing it that way but I also know she isn't the type to quietly walk away from something which offends her. I apologize for the messiness and reiterate the move gently just to pad any expectations. They leave shortly after without incident. \n\n**Now**\n\nI am still quite anxious. Maybe there is something she saw that was bad enough to not offer the new place and I'll get an awful text later telling me how bad of a tenant I am. But, I can't stop it if it's coming now, only deal with it if it comes. But, above that I am fucking proud of myself. It took every day of trial and often misery to get to where I could do this but I fucking did it. I cleaned my whole house in a day. Yeah, it's not perfect. Plenty of work still to do. But I wasn't ashamed and it wasn't a flat out tragedy the moment they pulled up. I'm exhausted. But every bit of work paid off today. Even if I don't pass the test, I gave myself a damn good fighting chance. Something that just a year ago would have been absolutely impossible to do on my own. \n\n**Takeaways**\n\nI share this very long story of my journey towards a clean house to celebrate. But, more than that, I want to share the details of what learning to live with ADHD looks like for me and hope that others who are fighting this battle can find inspiration and encouragement in it. It doesn't happen overnight. I didn't have a \"see the light\" moment. Hell, my house is really only clean enough to make a shaky and temporary experience believable. This past year has been hard and there are many challenges, wins, and losses that I haven't shared which also took place in that time. But I did it. I fucking did it. There's a joke in my family that \"Vox can't clean\" because I quite literally didn't understand how to clean a space until I was at least 20. But today, I did it.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is month 13 on a long and arduous journey to improve my mental and physical health. I was diagnosed with ADHD in January of last year alongside a re-diagnosis of CPTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and speculated ASD. I went through a tough breakup in March of &amp;#39;22 and have been living alone since. Today, I cleaned my whole house. It&amp;#39;s not perfect, but it&amp;#39;s a huge victory and I wanted to share my story thus far. The timeline starts immediately following my breakup because I knew I had to start prioritizing my health if I was going to survive the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0-3 Months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of depression. Total bedlock and only eating fast food (if I even ate). The house quickly became a mess. I&amp;#39;m talking 6-7 trash bags worth of garbage, old food waste and dirty dishes abound. I started therapy and was prescribed Strattera. I am someone who mostly avoids psychiatric medication but will resort to it if the bottom falls out beneath me. This was definitely that sort of time. I was not showering, no clean clothes, nothing. It marks one of the lowest points I have ever been in my life. Not the lowest, but top 5 for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this time, I worked with my therapist primarily on the smallest and simplest habits I possibly could. While I have had several years of CBT it felt like I was starting from a flat zero. It took me a month to get a shower. I got a nice haircut and journaled a little bit. I also began picking up one piece of trash a day. Lastly, I moved into my living room. My bedroom was too mangled to be remotely healthy to live in and I didn&amp;#39;t have the fortitude to fix it just yet, so I relocated to the living room and began sleeping on the couch. While it was a mess in the living room, it was better and I could focus on throwing just one piece of trash away a day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of three months things were still pretty dire but I had the smallest bit of momentum to work with. I was able to socialize again and made a few friends. This was the greatest success in the first three months. I was deeply ashamed of my house and home life, but I felt pride in seeing my friends and singing karaoke every week. I had a light to hold on to and I was no longer bedlocked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4-6 Months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still a lot of depression. Sleeping on the couch isn&amp;#39;t exactly the most fun. But, my cleaning habit was getting better. I called up on some family to support me and we did a run on the house together. It wasn&amp;#39;t perfect, but a lot of the trash was picked up and the dirty dishes were put into the sink. The house was not clean, but it wasn&amp;#39;t a living tragedy either. I pushed a few directions in my diet and made some progress but it didn&amp;#39;t quite stick. This time period was a lot of pushing and falling back. Progress would be made and then quickly lost. My depression was no longer constant but still prominent and reliably cyclical - every 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this time, I focused on coping skills and dealing with overwhelm. Everywhere I looked there was an overwhelming problem. I had to keep my job which required travel at the time. I had to keep up with the living room so I didn&amp;#39;t compromise the only relatively clean space I had in my house. I had to keep my social life going. Everything was too much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of 6 months I was pretty low. It felt like everything I did kept getting wiped out. But I kept my shower habits and social habits. I didn&amp;#39;t realize the progress I was making yet. Slowly, I was getting better at fighting back against the depression, anxiety, and overall resistance I felt with the world. Each victory was progress and I would soon realize that the list of ways I could be cut down by my problems was indeed finite - not limitless. But boy was I low. I had also come to realize that I was incredibly dependent on external validation and the pursuit of love. I won&amp;#39;t dive into the details and stories of how that progressed over this time period, but I&amp;#39;ll touch on it later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7-9 Months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A notable shift in my awareness. Problems were happening just as often as before, but new problems weren&amp;#39;t. It was usually the same story I had seen before. Anxiety about taking the trash out because the cold was intimidating. Distraction by video games and online videos. Exhaustion from a god awful sleep schedule. I was beginning to understand how all of these things were playing together and realizing how often I overthink my issues. This was the push to stop thinking and start doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this time, I stopped taking Strattera. While I was still quite low I felt I had the clarity to see my problems and solve them. Since I had not been taking it for a long time, it wasn&amp;#39;t really a problem to stop. The first week was rough but it quickly improved thereafter. I began pushing more against the resistance my mental illnesses were giving me. It was a brute force tactic that worked for a good bit of time. I got a lot of the dishes washed and redecorated my living room - the first bit of redecoration since my breakup. The living room was entirely clean, top to bottom. I implemented some house tricks to get things more friendly to my ever distracted mind. I was punching in all directions as hard as I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it did come with a price. At the end of 9 months I got blasted with a major burnout episode. I suddenly couldn&amp;#39;t do anything. My depression hit me like a freight train and I watched for weeks as I saw the cleanliness fade, the bedlock (or couchlock) return, and I started to isolate again. I just didn&amp;#39;t have the energy to sustain everything I was doing. Thus, it all fell apart. At the end of 9 months, the house looked almost identical to the mess it was in month 0. I was mortified. I felt trapped and hopeless. Frustrated at myself. I didn&amp;#39;t understand how I could fight so hard for 9 months just to end up back at square one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10-12 Months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling desperate and defeated, I spoke to my therapist about this. She&amp;#39;s usually just there to reflect my thoughts back to me so I can sort them out but this time I really needed some guidance because I was lost. She encouraged me to, instead of try one coping mechanism as hard as I could, to try several and see if one works better in that moment than another. She also pointed out that I had very rigid thinking. What I thought were practical and rationalized thoughts were really quite negative perspectives. Around this time I had some timely conversations with a good friend who pointed out something very similar to me relevant to the dependency on others I had mentioned. He said &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t need to provide value or entertainment for us (our friends) to enjoy your company. You being here is enough.&amp;quot; I still don&amp;#39;t comprehend that statement. I really don&amp;#39;t. But it woke me up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this time, I focused on flexibility. Instead of pushing in one direction until I got the outcome I was looking for, I started pushing in different directions if for no reason than to challenge myself to move against the inertia of my own thoughts. I did things out of order because why not? I negotiated, bargained, sometimes pleaded with myself to get something done. I did things not because I wanted to or needed to, I did them because I wanted to do something other than what my brain wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a whole different movement. It wasn&amp;#39;t a bang of a revelation - but a slow burn that to this day I am cautious of. The house got cleaner, not because of some concerted effort to clean - but because I was just cleaning more. I was thinking less and doing more. I can&amp;#39;t pinpoint any specific transition that caused it, it just started happening. I would feel the weight of shame hit me and know I needed to do something. Sometimes the impulse was to play video games and so I would say &amp;quot;okay but clean first&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;take a shower first&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;take out the trash first&amp;quot;. I even started wanting to clean and I would say &amp;quot;Okay but do some dishes first&amp;quot;. I would introduce small barriers between me and what I wanted to do so that the things I wanted to do were rewards, not impulses. The depression cycle shifted from 2 weeks to a month. Something was changing. While the house and habits had fallen down, my rebound was much faster. I got the house and habits stabilized in just 1.5 months instead of 6 like before. I wasn&amp;#39;t back to square one, I was stronger as a person and more capable than before. It was working....I think? At least I was finally sleeping in my bed again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 Months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a text from my landlord offering a smaller living space near by. It&amp;#39;s cheaper and easier to maintain so I said hell yes. While moving is an arduous process, I felt it was exactly what I needed. The catch was, it&amp;#39;s in a month. Yikes. I kept pushing but not making a huge amount of progress. Rather, I wasn&amp;#39;t making progress fast enough. Things were getting better, I was starting to exercise a bit and I wasn&amp;#39;t eating takeout food anymore - but those things weren&amp;#39;t directly preparing me to move and I needed the direct motion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, yesterday, she asked if she could come do a quick walkthrough since they had plans to do renovations after I move out. Oh fuck. There&amp;#39;s 7-8 trash bags still on my porch. I missed garbage this week so the bins are full. There&amp;#39;s trash and clutter inside the house still. Oh fuck.

I had to go to the store and get some candles. I didn&amp;#39;t need every room to smell divine forever, just for the hour the landlord was here. I also needed some contractor bags to quickly pack away clutter and trash. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second problem was the trash. This one took some creativity. The place I am moving into is a considerable (and welcomed) downsize from my current abode. I used the carpenter bags as cover, mixing stuff I am getting rid of with straight up trash and moved it all to the dilapidated garage that they&amp;#39;ll be tearing down anyways. Mixing move out stuff with trash and concealing it in opaque black bags was good enough for me to pass as &amp;quot;moving clutter&amp;quot; and eek by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third was the organization.

It&amp;#39;s not anything illegal or lease breaking, but appearing organized and well put together is important. The relationship matters. I basically turned into an 8 year old.

    "body": "Honestly just a bit of a newbie venting post. I decided to try my hand at a 2D game because why keep wondering when I can just start doing?\n\nI have a background in software development (big surprise) mostly working with databases and monolithic systems like CRMs and marketing software.\n\nSuffice to say game development is a whole different beast of a challenge than large databases. Inputs and requests happen so quickly. I cringed at the idea of using the Update() command of Unity because 60 runs a second made my design brain spaz out.\n\nThankfully, I've gotten over it and continue to break down the assumptions my DB brain makes. Things like processing time per transaction are much more important than in the DB world where if a file is locked for a couple seconds then you just display a loading screen and go about your day.\n\nSo far, I have developed basic movement, animation, and interaction. It's nothing too crazy yet but I can click play, navigate some menus, and it feels kind of like a game.\n\nI went to start working on the battle system for the game which I was very excited for. This is where my software knowledge really helped me and modeling the different classes and how they are structured was super fun. But, I had one challenge to complete first - I wanted the player to have the option to say \"Yes\" or \"No\" when talking to the sprite that would trigger the combat sequence.\n\nOh.My.God\n\n**Dialogue v1.0**\n\nI started the dialogue system by following a tutorial. It was maybe the second thing I built in the whole project so I was very much following along and learning how things work in Unity. It was about as simple as it can get. \n\nA script on the object and a playerInteract script talked to each other. When Player was in the circle Collider the playerInteract script picked up the object and waited for the input trigger. Once triggered, it checked if the object talked and logged the message in the debug menu. Simple enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dialogue v2.0**\n\nAfter making some simple menus and getting used to the UI layer a bit, I decided it was time to display the text on the screen. Setting up the canvas and getting the script to open/close the canvas and display the message was simple enough. But I realized a single message per object was a rough limitation to build a game with and just slapping the dialogue on the screen felt really jarring. This is when the complexity really kicked off.\n\nI swapped the String variable for a List&lt;String&gt; so I can have characters with varying amounts of dialogue. Sweet. Update the functions to accept a list and we're good to go.\n\nBut wait, it needs to move to the next message after every input from the player. Okay, so we say once the message is displayed to remove that message from the list so the next one can pop up.\n\nBut wait, if the player leaves the Collider there's no object to reference, so we have to deactivate the dialogue box so they aren't confusing the system about which person they're talking to.\n\nBut wait, it's ugly as sin to just slap the full message up, I need to incorporate a typing effect to smooth out the experience\n\nBut wait, if the player doesn't want to wait for the dialogue to type out I need the ability to rush the text. But the message was registering as displayed so it would dismiss early.\n\nBut wait, but wait, but wait....\n\n**And it doesn't help the player can be smashing the button like a psychopath triggering more things to happen.**\n\n\\*sigh\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A Brief Intermission**\n\nI finally got the dialogue acceptably bad. The code was atrocious but it worked. It felt just like the games I loved playing as a kid. I even had chests and items sending alerts in the dialogue box. It was scuffed in some areas but damn it there was dialogue. \n\nI decided to take a break on the dialogue system and go back to the combat system. I may not be able to fight yet but I can at least start setting up things like player stats and moves. I learned what the hell Monobehavior meant, how to set up scripts that can be accessed globally without rendering a GameObject, and even set up the start of my global move list catalogue for moves that will be available in the game. This structure would be very similar to how I manage items in the game as well which was super exciting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dialogue v3.0**\n\nI pushed the battle system code as far as I could before it was time to start testing it. But, I had the same problem still, I needed the option to select options in my dialogue. I promised myself I would get that done to trigger the battle scene and I was set on doing so. \n\nI opened up the dialogue code and just about cried. It was only a few hundred lines of code across 3-4 scripts but it was DISGUSTING. One function had if statements 5 layers deep (it was 4am when I wrote it so give me a break). Not only that, I was still operating on the List&lt;String&gt; variable for my messages. My messages had no properties and the system had to handle all of the logic to determine what the various types and properties of a message could be. The variable names were of no help either. Even the comments were hard to follow. While the idea of \"all chests and items talk\" was cute, I knew what this meant.\n\nTime to refactor the code. \n\nApplying what I learned from the battle system work I had done I set up a Message class that would allow me to assign properties to messages. This immediately cut a solid 50 lines of conditional logic  out of the system. I also implemented a separate script for talking objects and put the ability to post system messages in a global utility script. These options gave me WAY more flexibility for how I can approach the system.\n\nFrom there, it was a matter of rejiggering the functions to look at the new properties, cutting out unnecessary variable assignments, and refining the remaining logic to happen in proper sequential order. A little bit of testing and find/fixing and the dialogue system was better than ever. \n\nI probably broke even on the total LoC count but I was able to add a bunch of new functionality to the system. System dialogue was now centered, I can tell the system when to slow down the text on the screen, and cleared up several graphical glitches along the way. Not only that, adding my menu system for dialogue should be much easier. Just a few properties and a bit of logic will sort out the system with the new feature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is easily the most challenging development experience I have ever had. There are still a few bugs to work out (like progressing dialogue with the inventory screen open) and of course the \"yes/no\" response feature. But I think the refactoring really set me up to bring this thing to the finish line and get a complete dialogue system for the game that can be reused consistently and easily.\n\nWhile it has been incredibly difficult, I am also having more fun than I have had in YEARS of software development. There's something about seeing the characters on the screen move and talk to you that is just so gratifying.",

Up to this point it was usually once every 7-8 games. Really not that influential. However, this rank has been pretty bad. I used rocket league tracker to track the opponents and teammates I play with and it's about every 3-4 games that a suspicious account is present in the game. That's not including the matches where I could not find anyone on the tracker. It's...pretty bad. \n\n**- Weird shift in playstyles -** \n\nC2 was pretty cool, albeit a bit hard to predict. But for some reason in C3 (which I have gone through all divisions of at least once) seems to be hyper aggressive. I generally play a pretty reserved game style and in C3 I am finding I need to be even more reserved. Just about every play my teammate is either on the opponent's backboard or right up on me when I approach the ball. Same on the opponent's side too. Way more double commits and trying to play really fast. Not to mention I probably see my teammate cut rotation an average of 2-3 times before I decide to go. \n\nThat's not to say my teammates suck. A lot of them have some pretty nifty shots. They made it to this rank so clearly they have some capabilities comparable to mine. But holy cow are players super aggressive in this rank. It's definitely challenging my abilities to defend. Hell, I don't even mind the cutting rotation really, but I think a lot of people at this rank don't realize that if you're going to cut, you need to have a plan to get boost and get back to net quickly because you're probably taking a disadvantaged 50 when you do.\n\n**- Some shots are simply impossible to save -**\n\nThis is the first rank I have seen this consistently appear. Up to c2 you can really sit and wait for most shots. Occasionally there would be a banger that's impossible to react to but not enough to decide most games. This rank, especially in the higher divisions, is way different. If you wait until they get positioned for a shot you have about a 50/50 chance of them shooting it in a way that you can save unless you predict the shot well. Most people have 2-4 shots they consistently do well with and some awareness of faking. If you're stuck in net, good luck.\n\n**- The rumors are true. Players tilt like mad in this rank -**\n\nTwo goals down has always been the number I see most people tilt at. But man, when C3s tilt they tilt hard. As if the added aggression to playing in this rank wasn't enough, when people tilt in this rank they really crank the aggression knob up. That, or they straight up throw but that's nothing new. \n\n**- I underestimated how tempting GC really is -**\n\nI'll admit, my sensitivity has gone up as well. I wouldn't say I am dying to get to GC but I noticed I am much more likely to tilt in this rank myself. Partly because GC is right there. Partly because I find aggressive playstyles aggravating to play with unless I have comms. I can say I definitely don't like this rank as much as C2 lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have chat enabled, so I can't speak to toxicity in this rank. I have zero intention of turning it on too. But, overall, I think I get why this rank is so infamous. I also think the path to improving is pretty clear for me so I am excited for that. I'm thankful that I can play slightly higher ranks in casual - those games are far more relaxing than C3 level comp.",

    "body": "\nWell it finally happened today. I've somehow stumbled my way into the top 6% of players in the game in just over 500 hrs of match time almost entirely solo q. I even grabbed my 4th high five. \n\nPer my personal tradition of documenting my most important lessons with each rank up here's a few things I've learned. \n\n1 - Stop playing when your rank begins to drop. Go to casual. \n\nCould be fatigue or an off day. I can usually do about 4 hrs of play before I need to reset with casual or free play. The mental strain of this game at the higher ranks is really intense. Shoot to break even or get at least 1 division each session. If you start underperforming then tap out. I generally will keep going until I get 2 games in a row where i didnt at least match my teammates performance. \n\n2 - Smurfs aren't as common as you may think. \n\nYes they happen. Yes I've had a few sessions where there were 3 or 4 in a row. That's extremely uncommon. I made a point to check every opponent I lost on the tracker, especially those with GC titles or explosions, and most of them were either GC for a very short period of time (likely boosted or lucky) or they've been on a steady decline for a while and are just now working their way back up. I know this may be a hot take but really, it's not as common as this sub often makes it seem. At least in my experience. \n\n3 - Don't tilt and don't quit (unless it's a blowout)\n\nThe most games I've conceded were due to me, my teammate, or both of us tilting. By far. My rule is 2 goals per minute can be made up. If you're quitting early you're losing more than you should. You're also being a douche to your teammates. Don't be a douche. \n\n4 - Use the 9 segments of the field to focus on weaknesses\n\nBack left, back mid, back right, mid left, mid, mid right, up left, up mid, up right. Where do you lose the ball the most? How do higher rank players do differently than you? Why? I've found viewing the game as situations that occur in zones both simplified the game and made it much clearer where I needed to focus. \n\n5 - Play style &gt; Meta rules\n\nThis is especially true in solo q. Some people like to constantly pressure the ball. Some people like deep rotations. Some are mechanical. Some like bumps. None of these tactics are necessarily bad. Mistakes and bad plays will happen constantly in the game so it's up to you to ensure the team is balanced and prepared for that. How you do that is what I would call your play style.\n\nFor example, two really mechanical and aggressive players can crush an opponent. But if I have an aggressive teammate I hang back because I don't really like playing super aggressive and am better on defense. Both are valid responses to having an aggressive teammate, so pick the one you like the most. Practice all options regardless. Sometimes the option you don't excel in is better and wins the game. \n\nThe meta is just a guideline to follow. If you follow it perfectly it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win. Sometimes following it too closely will actually cost you games.\n\n6 - Position ahead, watch the field before you touch the ball. \n\nYour goal with positioning should be able to control the ball next. However, that's not always the right move. Sometimes it's best to just let it go. I've found the posturing to outplay my opponents but always yielding to my teammate is a good balance. If my opponent goes I'll go for a 50 or an outplay. If my teammate goes, it's best I don't. \n\n7 - Relax and have fun\n\nI'm actually a bit embarrassed this took me so long to learn. I used to obsess over this game. 6 hrs a day every day at minimum. It was not good. If your goal is to go pro then start thinking of it like a business than a hobby. Make investments into content creation, coaching, and networking. Get involved in leagues and tournaments. Otherwise, quit fooling yourself. It's not like you hit SSL and suddenly orgs are trying to sign you. That's not even touching on the sheer skill gap between pros and typical players. Less than a year ago as a C2 I was getting absolutely handled by a c3. Dude made me look like I knew nothing about the game. That skill gap only widens between each rank as you go higher. If pro is your dream, it is attainable, but you've got to treat it like a profession if you want to reach it.\n\nOtherwise, just play the game and have fun. I love getting better and hitting the ball occasionally. Maybe I'll peak at c3. Maybe I'll continue going higher. I don't know, I don't care. I'm having fun with the game and that's the whole point for me. \n\n8 - Match the pace of the game\n\nPlaying too quickly or too slowly can be detrimental. I actually learned this initially from watching pro players in placement matches where they went up against GC2 and GC3 players. They complained that it was \"harder\" and they had to \"adjust\". If you've ever played Sekiro you'll know what I mean by paying attention to the rhythm of the game. Sometimes slower is better. Sometimes faster is better. You can also control the pace by how you handle your ball possession. Hopefully by GC I'll have a better way to explain this or maybe a commentor can do better than I. It's a lot like matching the speed of the ball. Abrupt changes which slow it down (faking) and speeding it up (flicking) are the basics of using it to outplay the opponent. But you've got to match first. \n\nGood luck and have fun!",

Go to casual. \n\nCould be fatigue or an off day. I can usually do about 4 hrs of play before I need to reset with casual or free play. The mental strain of this game at the higher ranks is really intense. Shoot to break even or get at least 1 division each session. If you start underperforming then tap out. I generally will keep going until I get 2 games in a row where i didnt at least match my teammates performance. \n\n2 - Smurfs aren't as common as you may think. \n\nYes they happen. Yes I've had a few sessions where there were 3 or 4 in a row. That's extremely uncommon. I made a point to check every opponent I lost on the tracker, especially those with GC titles or explosions, and most of them were either GC for a very short period of time (likely boosted or lucky) or they've been on a steady decline for a while and are just now working their way back up. I know this may be a hot take but really, it's not as common as this sub often makes it seem. At least in my experience. \n\n3 - Don't tilt and don't quit (unless it's a blowout)\n\nThe most games I've conceded were due to me, my teammate, or both of us tilting. By far. My rule is 2 goals per minute can be made up. If you're quitting early you're losing more than you should. You're also being a douche to your teammates. Don't be a douche. \n\n4 - Use the 9 segments of the field to focus on weaknesses\n\nBack left, back mid, back right, mid left, mid, mid right, up left, up mid, up right. Where do you lose the ball the most? How do higher rank players do differently than you? Why? I've found viewing the game as situations that occur in zones both simplified the game and made it much clearer where I needed to focus. \n\n5 - Play style &gt; Meta rules\n\nThis is especially true in solo q. Some people like to constantly pressure the ball. Some people like deep rotations. Some are mechanical. Some like bumps. None of these tactics are necessarily bad. Mistakes and bad plays will happen constantly in the game so it's up to you to ensure the team is balanced and prepared for that. How you do that is what I would call your play style.\n\nFor example, two really mechanical and aggressive players can crush an opponent. But if I have an aggressive teammate I hang back because I don't really like playing super aggressive and am better on defense. Both are valid responses to having an aggressive teammate, so pick the one you like the most. Practice all options regardless. Sometimes the option you don't excel in is better and wins the game. \n\nThe meta is just a guideline to follow. If you follow it perfectly it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win. Sometimes following it too closely will actually cost you games.\n\n6 - Position ahead, watch the field before you touch the ball. \n\nYour goal with positioning should be able to control the ball next. However, that's not always the right move. Sometimes it's best to just let it go. I've found the posturing to outplay my opponents but always yielding to my teammate is a good balance. If my opponent goes I'll go for a 50 or an outplay. If my teammate goes, it's best I don't. \n\n7 - Relax and have fun\n\nI'm actually a bit embarrassed this took me so long to learn. I used to obsess over this game. 6 hrs a day every day at minimum. It was not good. If your goal is to go pro then start thinking of it like a business than a hobby. Make investments into content creation, coaching, and networking. Get involved in leagues and tournaments. Otherwise, quit fooling yourself. It's not like you hit SSL and suddenly orgs are trying to sign you. That's not even touching on the sheer skill gap between pros and typical players. Less than a year ago as a C2 I was getting absolutely handled by a c3. Dude made me look like I knew nothing about the game. That skill gap only widens between each rank as you go higher. If pro is your dream, it is attainable, but you've got to treat it like a profession if you want to reach it.\n\nOtherwise, just play the game and have fun. I love getting better and hitting the ball occasionally. Maybe I'll peak at c3. Maybe I'll continue going higher. I don't know, I don't care. I'm having fun with the game and that's the whole point for me. \n\n8 - Match the pace of the game\n\nPlaying too quickly or too slowly can be detrimental. I actually learned this initially from watching pro players in placement matches where they went up against GC2 and GC3 players. They complained that it was \"harder\" and they had to \"adjust\". If you've ever played Sekiro you'll know what I mean by paying attention to the rhythm of the game. Sometimes slower is better. Sometimes faster is better. You can also control the pace by how you handle your ball possession. Hopefully by GC I'll have a better way to explain this or maybe a commentor can do better than I. It's a lot like matching the speed of the ball. Abrupt changes which slow it down (faking) and speeding it up (flicking) are the basics of using it to outplay the opponent. But you've got to match first. \n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\n\nEdit: forgot one lesson I learned just as I ranked up",

Improving coping skills and habits, taking better care of myself, etc. I've had depression for almost 10 years (diagnosed that is) and have really been hitting it hard for the last 4-5 months. \n\nBefore, I had a lot that I would ruminate on. Freshly broken up, house a mess, overwhelming responsibilities, illness in the family, poor self image, you name it. I'm proud to say that I've made progress in a lot of directions and most of my ruminating thoughts have been dealt with pretty well.\n\nWhat I did not expect and I am learning now is those are just catalysts for the depression. It's certainly better than it was but I am still fucking depressed. I don't have a reason! It's like when you have that general anxious feeling that isn't pointed at anything, but depression. \n\nThe kicker is that is depressing to me. So I am also depressed about still being depressed because I had a misguided expectation that when I resolve the depressing thoughts it would stop happening. But here I am, on a wonderful Saturday afternoon depressed over...nothing.\n\nI'd be open to hearing other people's experience with this. It's been going for a good 2 weeks now and I am a little lost. I can cope and manage it well enough to remain safe but I can feel the familiar hopelessness starting to creep in. \n\n\\---enter venting---\n\nIs this it? I have a good life and years of therapy trained me to cope with this. I'm doing great and feeling awful. Will nothing be enough for me? I don't want more from life. I have far more than I could ever have wished. I am so grateful for it all. But it feels like all I have done has just ensured that I emotionally bleed out on a comfortable bed from a wound I can't see. I've been successful despite my misery. But that wasn't the intent. I just don't want to be miserable anymore. \n\nThe therapy is great. My habits are improving and I feel it helping. But it doesn't fill this void within me. I feel good about myself despite my pain. The medications helped when I was at my worst, but they only make it easier to move despite the feeling. I've improved my diet tremendously, but the food doesn't fill me up where I feel the emptiest. \n\nThe tools they give me to redirect my thoughts only work when there are thoughts to redirect. I don't have thoughts that bother me right now. I have a feeling. The feeling of my life draining rapidly from my body. It's not sadness, nor anger. I feel those separately and not constantly in this state. I don't know if it's even an emotion. It's like there's a body within my body - maybe what you'd call a soul - and that inner body has been absolutely ravaged. The muscles and bones of my physical body are well enough.

This is just an issue I've noticed that keeps tripping me up in my games and I could use some advice.\n\nIt feels like my positioning is way off in most of my 2s games. Particularly when I am 2nd man. I do pretty well as first man (at least considering my rank) to hold the ball and get something set up. However, I feel like I am often very slow to the ball when I am second man. Most of the goals I concede are because I am too far back in the play and if my teammate doesn't get a good cut in rotation I'm stuck in a 2v1 which, while I sometimes defend, isn't always good.\n\nHowever, I find when I push up more to combat this I am on the wrong end of the 50s a lot and have to double back or commit to an unfavorable challenge. I try to keep the 1/3rds spacing rule in mind but I get so confused about whether my teammate is leaving the ball, where the 50 is going to go, whether someone is actually going to hit the ball, etc. I feel I read the play wrong way more often than I read it correctly.\n\nWhat's really confusing, and maybe this is the problem, is I often pair up with GCs in casual. I'm betting they're not going all out in casual so I don't think I'm necessarily playing at a GC level with them. However, they are much more consistent in hitting the ball so I don't have to play around the potential whiffs and weird plays as often. They're also better at accommodating for my mistakes so it's harder to tell if I am adjusting to them well or if they're doing most of the work adjusting to me. I also know they will rotate pretty quickly so I can be a bit more of a ham.\n\nAnyways, just looking for some advice for how I can improve here. I feel I could contribute a lot more to my teams if I had a better sense of what my teammate is trying to do and, more importantly, whether or not they're going to pull it off.\n\nEDIT: Just adding some common scenarios I find myself in.\n\n* Teammate goes for an aerial off the wall. Usually this gets cleared out since C2 isn't really the epitome of aerial control so I tend to follow in mid just a bit behind in case they get a bad clear. But I have no clue which direction the ball is about to clear to and am often slow to the follow up on these.\n* Ball dies somewhere on the field and everyone is flipping around it trying to make it move. I think my teammate is going to leave after a few seconds and begin to push but after a half second they turn around and then I have to try and scramble back. This gives the opponent a free clear and puts me rushing to make the save.\n* 50 occurs and the ball pinches out. I am usually the slower of the two to the ball regardless of where it goes. I'm really bad at reading 50s. \n* Teammate goes for aerial anything and misses...I don't know what the ideal position is when my teammate aerials across the map for something.",

For example -\n\n* I am a neurotypical (NT) person wanting to ask a question about ADHD and forgetfulness. So my post title would look something like this: \"NT asking ADHD: Do you really forget things all the time?\"\n* I am an autistic person asking NT people for advice on social cues. My post title could be: \"autistic asking NT: Did I miss a social cue here?\" OR \"ND asking NT: Did I miss a social cue here?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Please note:** We do not and will not require anyone to divulge information about their mental conditions. If you do not wish to state your specific conditions then please feel free to simply put \"ND\" or \"Neurodivergent\" in your post title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ---Responding To A Post---\n\nWhile posts are generally directed to a specific group (NT, ND, etc.) we recognize that sometimes you may be able to provide value and insight when you are not of the requested group. As a community, we encourage open communication between people of all neurostatuses.\n\nFor this reason, we encourage commenters to state their neurostatus in their comment or express it with a user flair before commenting. Doing this helps the OP understand from what perspective you are answering their question and helps clarify whether or not you are from their desired audience.\n\nPer rule 3 -  Please ensure that direct replies to posts (top level comments) are an honest attempt to answer the post's question. You may share personal experience and/or knowledge as you feel comfortable doing. Please do not reply to posts sarcastically or offensively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ---Feedback---\n\nWe are a new sub and looking to grow and improve!
