I started with Kim, moved to Ryu and settled with Gief in January.\n\nI made it to gold, then next was to get to diamond and be fine there. Breezed through 1-4 and 5 was a meat grinder for sure. I almost deranked back down to 4. Had a great night with a solid win over a Master which gave me an LP boost. Was so close at 1 LP until master! I lost the promo match and went on a win, lose, win, lose streak in addition to my kiddo crying so I had to get to her lol.\n\nFinally got back into the groove and was matched with JP for Promo. This is one of my hardest match ups as a Gief main but I did it!\n\nLike a lot of people here, I've been playing SF since 2. I didn't really learn how to actually play until SF6. I told myself I'm gonna learn and I still am! I have total of 325 hours of total play time between rank/training/casuals.\n\nAs a Dad, this game has been a god send. With the limited time I have, I can play matches when my kid sleeps and get to her when she wakes (sometimes frequent) and be back to playing. I love being able to put it down and pick it back up. Short or long sessions has been great. So if I one and done peeps, it's due to family stuff and I'm sorry haha! Kiddo #2 is coming soon so I am even more happy to get Master now...time is gonna be shorter haha\n\nTo all the FGC Dad's out there with little time, ya'll got this! Won my first Master set too! Time to learn from all the Masters out there!\n\nI DO THIS FOR THE LOYAL FANS",
