Just four fields: Entry Date, Section, Action, Display. This is handy in any case, given that the Setup Audit Traildownload only goes back six months. And although I keep notes as I work, I don't write down every little detail and this way I can retrace my steps if I need to troubleshoot something I did weeks ago. \n\nI have also started on a custom object to save AI-generated summaries for things like Apex and flows, but I'm getting mixed results. When I ask Agentforce Dev Assistant in VSCode to summarize a flow-meta.xml file, it's either very excellent or utter rubbish - more often utter rubbish. If I open a flow in Flow Builder in the Edge browser, MS Copilot actually does a reliably decent job of summarizing the flow sequence if all the elements have descriptive names, but it misses most of the underlying details. GitHub Copilot writes a nice summary of flow-meta.xml, but I only have a free account which limits how much I can do with it.\n\nThe nice thing about a custom object in Salesforce is that searching and reporting are a given, and you can easily add automation for notifications about changes made. And you can limit the scope to just want you want to document. I'm mainly concerned with documenting Apex and flows, but a wider scope would probably require something more sophisticated, such as tools mentioned elsewhere in comments.\n\nThe Flows tab that was introduced a couple of releases back is also handy.

But we switched to Jotform because our FA subscription only supported one Salesforce integration and we have multiple Salesforce orgs. We have the Gold plan and the cost is not much more than what we were paying for FA's rock-bottom plan. \n\nThe challenge with any Salesforce form integration is to make sure data types and picklist value sets match as much as possible at both ends - and that the form is constructed so that validation rules don't get triggered. The nice thing about Jotform is that when the Salesforce integration part fails, for what ever reason, the user isn't presented with an error message. Instead, the submission is saved in Jotform and the error is logged. The logs are available for 30 days so you can find the submissions that never made it into Salesforce, review the error messages, correct the problem, and re-submit. You can also configure an email notification for when Salesforce integration fails. It's still work for you to keep up with, but at least as far as the user is concerned, their submission is accepted and they can go on with their day instead of having to shoot someone an email to say the form isn't working.\n\nWhat FA DOES handle better is complex logic, conditional display and formulas. There are also some form elements that Jotform does not directly support for Salesforce integrations, such as matrix elements, which is a pain point for us - but it was more important that we have the capability to integrate with multiple Salesforce orgs. FA also allows you to easily inactivate a form and display a message. In Jotform, it's not as straightforward.\n\nJotform has a free version that's easy to try.\n\nFinally, whichever form building/hosting tool you use to push data to Salesforce, it's a favor to everyone to keep forms as short and simple as possible :)",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used FormAssembly for several years and it was fine for us. But we switched to Jotform because our FA subscription only supported one Salesforce integration and we have multiple Salesforce orgs. We have the Gold plan and the cost is not much more than what we were paying for FA&amp;#39;s rock-bottom plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The challenge with any Salesforce form integration is to make sure data types and picklist value sets match as much as possible at both ends - and that the form is constructed so that validation rules don&amp;#39;t get triggered. The nice thing about Jotform is that when the Salesforce integration part fails, for what ever reason, the user isn&amp;#39;t presented with an error message. Instead, the submission is saved in Jotform and the error is logged. The logs are available for 30 days so you can find the submissions that never made it into Salesforce, review the error messages, correct the problem, and re-submit. You can also configure an email notification for when Salesforce integration fails. It&amp;#39;s still work for you to keep up with, but at least as far as the user is concerned, their submission is accepted and they can go on with their day instead of having to shoot someone an email to say the form isn&amp;#39;t working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What FA DOES handle better is complex logic, conditional display and formulas. There are also some form elements that Jotform does not directly support for Salesforce integrations, such as matrix elements, which is a pain point for us - but it was more important that we have the capability to integrate with multiple Salesforce orgs. FA also allows you to easily inactivate a form and display a message. In Jotform, it&amp;#39;s not as straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jotform has a free version that&amp;#39;s easy to try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, whichever form building/hosting tool you use to push data to Salesforce, it&amp;#39;s a favor to everyone to keep forms as short and simple as possible :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
