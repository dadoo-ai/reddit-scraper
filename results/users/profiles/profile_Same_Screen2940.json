IF you live at home with no rent/bills/food expenses and IF you spend fuck all money for 4 whole years, you still need an income of about 80k annually to cover this. This gives a pretty small allowance for petrol, clothes etc\n\nEven then, having your 10%, you would need a 1.7m mortgage (im not even going to bother including stamp duty and initial purchasing expenses)\n\nTo be able to afford this kind of mortgage you would need to earn 300k+ - and that is just based of the standard HEM living expenses calculations and assuming a 30 year loan. This is also assuming it’s a couple without kids\n\nSo to be honest, no you can’t just live at home and work 60 hours weeks to save a house deposit and snap your fingers and have a house. \n\nThe only people who think this already own a house and have no idea what the market really looks like",
