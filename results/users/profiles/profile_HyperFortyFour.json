I need to have an org-wide ‘flag’ that can essentially be used as an indicator that a specific custom object is in ‘maintenance mode’. The turning on and off of this flag must send a custom platform event. The flag itself if not enabled must prevent any updates occurring to records in the custom object. However, when the flag is enabled, edits can be made to the custom object. Finally, if the flag has been turned on and 12 hours passes and the flag is not turned off, the system admins of the org should be alerted to the fact the flag is still on. How would you achieve this, and there is a preference for a declarative solution over programmatic, however Apex development can be performed where needed.”",

The important event really is the flag going from on to off which is a signal to the external client to perform a GraphQL query on the custom object to retrieve latest state of all records. No point using Change Data Capture or platform events for record changes in the custom object because during the maintenance window, records take on temporary states as they are renamed, reparented, etc. All that really matters is the final state off all records in the custom object at the end of the maintenance window. Hope that provided enough context.",

There are so many areas that could prevent it working, it needs some more specialist knowledge to be honest. Good luck!",
