And these jobs could definitely support a person before more than the last few decades because of this sentiment growing and wages stagnating over the years. If there weren&amp;#39;t people working during the day they&amp;#39;d probably end up closing because they&amp;#39;re not getting enough revenue to make it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That said this was 10+ years ago coming out of the great recession and housing was at least much cheaper than the last couple years. Don't know how people can do that anymore without being broke or in debt (and still kinda broke).",
