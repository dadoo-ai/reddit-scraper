I'm hoping to leverage just a bit more of the community goodwill in helping me get a little direction on where to take my team, and to get some external validation on how I should feel about my team.\n\n**League Rules:** 30 roster spots, 14 teams, 1QB/1RB/1WR/1TE /1 Defense/2 RB or WR flex/2 WR or TE flex\n\n**League Scoring:** 0.8 PPR, 6 pt TDs, -3 pts INT, -2 pts fumbles, standard .1 pts for rushing/receiving yards, .04 points per passing yard\n\n**QBs:** Philip Rivers, Paxton Lynch, DeShone Kizer, Case Keenum, Tony Romo (not sure how to feel about the fact that he's the actual Dak handcuff)\n\n**RB:** Mark Ingram, Chris Johnson, TJ Logan, Marlon Mack, Doug Martin, Joe Mixon, Alfred Morris, Bobby Rainey, Jacquizz Rodgers, TJ Yeldon\n\n**WR:** Tavon Austin, Doug Baldwin, Anquan Boldin, Isaiah Ford, Ted Ginn, Dontrelle Inman, Jarvis Landry, Jeremy Maclin, Cameron Meredith, Andre Roberts, Allen Robinson, ArDarius Stewart, Chad Williams\n\n**TE:** Vernon Davis, Jack Doyle, Antonio Gates, Tyler Higbee, Dion Sims\n\nI'm a bit over-rostered right now, and will need to cut to 30 spots by the Monday before the season kicks off.  I think I've got that part of things handled, but I'm a bit at a loss to assess what my next moves should be.  I feel good at WR, a little weak at RB, and know that I need a TE solution to be competitive.  I've been in team-building mode for 3 years now, and feel like I'm probably still a year or two off of competitiveness.\n\n**Ask:** I'm seeking the sub's thoughts on the overall quality of my team and to understand what you'd do as your strategy for the next year or two were you in charge of this team.  \n\nThanks in advance - you guys and gals are great.",
