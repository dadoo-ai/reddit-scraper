We got this part working, now we just need to make the whole thing rock-solid end to end\". This apparently activated some intense over-engineering mode. Claude started parroting \"rock-solid\" in every message, PR descriptions, commit messages, etc., then Claude performed an end-to-end test of this new auth, prompting Claude with \"testing rock-solid auth implementation\". This spun up Claude Code in unattended mode, who responded with \"Understood, implementing rock-solid auth system\" (instead of the usual \"Ready to help!\"). So now this new session caught the rock-solid over-engineering bug. I let it run, for science. We ended up with a 2000-line PR with enterprise-grade auth - QR codes, TOTP, JWT, the works. In a completely empty repo. No database. No users table. Just... authentication. I left [this monstrosity of a PR](https://github.com/Cheffromspace/demo-repository/pull/11) up as a monument to Claude's tendency to be a little too helpful.\n\nI've been testing the boundaries of what Claude can do when given proper tools and autonomy. With Claude 4's capabilities, we're getting into territory where AI can handle real engineering work end-to-end.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with giving Claude more autonomy in their workflows?",
