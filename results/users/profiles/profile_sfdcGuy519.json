We're trying to lead them down the path of building out the experience we already have for customers so users with a partner license will get extended partner functionality. BUT the consultant is telling them that unless they build a separate portal using the Partner Central skin that they will lose the ability to do a lot of partner functions. I don't believe this to be true based on the fact that just a few years ago I worked with salesforce to build out a singular partner+customer community under the customer service skin and everything worked fine. Have things changed? Are we missing something obvious here? The partner can't clearly explain these supposed differences but now the department sponsoring the project is doubting our guidance after the partner has said this.\n\n**EDIT**: Wanted to share an update for others who find this in the future. We had a call with Salesforce and a community expert earlier today - they were able to connect with us very last minute while the decision making was happening internally, phew. Their suggestion based on our needs was \"one portal\". \n\nThe user who shared the link below was something they referenced too. The Customer Service template has like 99% overlap with Partner Central - it has *everything* but one item. All the other templates have lesser functionality. The link: [https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en\\_US&amp;id=sf.rss\\_component\\_reference\\_table.htm&amp;type=5](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&amp;id=sf.rss_component_reference_table.htm&amp;type=5)",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last couple places I&amp;#39;ve worked we&amp;#39;ve made one community and then utilized different license types and audiences to let customers see customer support related stuff, and partners see all of that &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; have the extended partner functionality available (deal registration, lead management, visibility across their managed customers, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The place I&amp;#39;m working now just brought on a consultant to build a &lt;strong&gt;separate&lt;/strong&gt; partner portal (experience) and didn&amp;#39;t involve the salesforce team in the decision. We&amp;#39;re trying to lead them down the path of building out the experience we already have for customers so users with a partner license will get extended partner functionality. BUT the consultant is telling them that unless they build a separate portal using the Partner Central skin that they will lose the ability to do a lot of partner functions. I don&amp;#39;t believe this to be true based on the fact that just a few years ago I worked with salesforce to build out a singular partner+customer community under the customer service skin and everything worked fine. Have things changed? Are we missing something obvious here? The partner can&amp;#39;t clearly explain these supposed differences but now the department sponsoring the project is doubting our guidance after the partner has said this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Wanted to share an update for others who find this in the future.

Given my Salesforce experience, I'm trying to lend a hand or an extra set of ideas anywhere I can to help my team mates along. This sub has been helpful when I was helping the LMS team more at my last employer, so I figured I'd pop back again.\n\nI think the main struggles seem to be:\n\n1: It seems Arlo doesn't integrate into a Salesforce Community and needs to have it's own customer portal in parallel to our community? Not a fan of having to give customers multiple logins to interact with our company. We'd like to see the learning as a part of the community we already run. This leads to issue 2\n\n2: The Arlo portal registration doesn't seem very customizable. Customers can enter any information they want, and if what they provide isn't an exact match to Salesforce then it'll create a whole new account and contact for them in Salesforce. Furthermore, Arlo tells us they don't support state/country picklists in Salesforce, which is what our company is about to transition to. This will cause registrations to fail, and their suggestion is that someone just watch the error log everyday and manually fix these.\n\n3: Something Arlo does causes it to run *massive* amounts of async apex jobs every hour in Salesforce, so much so that they've hit our org limit a couple times and literally brought our entire company's Salesforce org to a grinding halt in the middle of a business day until the limit reset. What is it doing that needs such massive batch jobs on a fairly small set of data?\n\nMy outsiders opinion is that this \"integration\" seem horrendous, and their support seems unwilling to make it better and expects us to use inferior business process in Salesforce to better accommodate the poor quality data it syncs over. They've recommended on many occasions to consider ditching things like key company automation flows, for example. We are a large international company, so dumbing down Salesforce to support their app just isn't an option.\n\nDoes anyone have a shining role model Arlo integration? Can I pick your brain if you do? I'd like to get an idea of how other Salesforce users are having these two systems work peacefully together since Arlo's support doesn't seem very willing in working with us. Or is this just not an LMS for a mid-size business like us and we need to realize that maybe we've outgrown it? There seems to be little appetite right now to shop around, unfortunately.",

    "body": "I'm looking for one (maybe two?) Salesforce Advanced Admin/Developer level resources who are looking to pickup some extra work on the side, or who are freelancers looking to fill more hours in a day. Preferably you'd be in or nearby to the GTA, as we're a couple hours outside the Toronto core and being able to do on-site meetings is a huge asset.\n\nBackstory: I run a small consulting start-up in my city which is a side gig supported by my primary employer, where I'm their admin/dev. I have a certain amount of during-business-hours time allocated each week to work on growing this company, but my workload from clients is already far exceeding that, but not quite enough yet where I can make this a full time gig. We're a niche in our city; the city has lots of Salesforce users, but no real local consulting companies. We've formed some partnerships and people are eating up having local talent, and we honestly haven't even marketed or left our own backyard yet; it's all been word of mouth.\n\nI'd love to have a subcontracted resource who's looking for casual work that can help out! You would represent us and work directly with clients, sign all the usual NDA and non-compete forms so you can't poach our customers, and we'd work to grow this into something big. Even if you aren't in a position to eventually be a full time staff addition when it gets to that point, I would totally respect the relationships you've built and keep you on as a sub-contractor still! I'd like to continue to use my time to focus on the business and marketing side so I can market and grow this into something that can sustain some full time staff!\n\nI can't offer the world in terms of pay; I'm a startup and have bills and things I need to pay off, but I'd love to hear what you think is fair for pay to see if we can find a number that works for both of us. If you're a freelancer and want to bring us new business, I'll pay you a commission too.\n\nIdeally you would be a pro at admin, advanced admin and declarative development. If you can code too, I can definitely start getting you work on that front as I don't have access to any in-country coding resources and often have India quote on that type of work. Experience with well known apps like Desk.com, Octiv/TinderBox, Pardot, etc. is an asset, as I do have some clients using apps.\n\nApologies to the admin if this type of post isn't allowed; I didn't see any rules that indicated such and hoped it would be okay to reach out to the Reddit community considering how much time I spend here on my personal account :)",

We already have a solution we&amp;#39;re paying for and using, and need to iron out some technicalities of it. Not the time, nor the place, to push your company. It&amp;#39;s like me being at the Toyota dealer with a car problem, and a Honda sales guy walks in and says &amp;quot;just buy my Honda!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
