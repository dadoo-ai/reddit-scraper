Is this true? when I ask him about hours, he says budget is the reason but I see average daily sales is almost the same like before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can I talk to someone higher about this?  what options do I have to improve my hours?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

After waiting for almost 45 minutes, I got this update that they have reached their capacity and are no longer hiring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of shitty hiring process is this? why even accept more applications and also schedule interviews more than your capacity? just f*cking delete the job posting if you got enough applicants already.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

After registration and logging in, user can look at what all items are posted in their neighbourhood in the home screen. if interested in any item, user can chat with the owner and make a deal. There is also a user profile screen in which user can see and edit their basic details like name, email, location and listings posted by them. So there are three tabs (Home screen: listings in the neighbourhood , chat screen: active chats and my profile screen)\n\nI am thinking to use Firestore to store the data, I need your suggestions on the best way to implement to avoid unnecessary costs for read write, etc. below are some things I am thinking to do to avoid unnecessary reads.\n\n* For My profile screen: I am thinking to save the user data in local data first and then write to firestore, upon going to my profile tab, I read the data from local instead of firestore. if he/she modifies any details, then save it to local and then to firestore.\n* For chats screen: I am thinking to use [socket.io](http://socket.io) or stream SDK for this. didn't start working on this yet. Suggestions to implement this in a best way. thinking of to delete the chats which are 6 months old.\n* For home screen(all listings posted): Users see this whenever the app is launched so do i have to always read the data from firestore or save the data to local from recent read from firestore and display it initially, place a refresh button to read the fresh data from firestore (does this give bad user experience)\n\nPlease suggest any alternatives if my approach posted above is not the best.\n\n  \n",

I worked as a Siebel CRM developer in the beginning of my career and then switched to Salesforce after a couple of years. I never saw this as a requirement in Siebel job postings because the underlying architecture(DB, business layer and then UI part) is same for all industry verticals and the functional or business process part can be understood in a month of two after joining the team. Same is the architecture for Salesforce as well(of-course Marc Benioff is a friend Tom Siebel and they worked together) Whatever the vertical is, Data security, Apex, flows, governor limits, integrations, LWC is same. Still, hiring team want experience in particular niche. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you also feel the same way? please share your thoughts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have applied for 100s of jobs but only a few got to initial screening calls and almost less than 5 interviews happened until now. None of them worked out, I performed bad at a couple of technical interviews but others just ghosted saying we got a better candidate.\n\nPlease, I need a honest feedback or suggestions. I do have a few questions which i believe are the reasons for my profile not getting shortlisted.\n\n* Would you consider a candidate whose last work experience is almost 2 or 3 years before? (I know a few friends who have been working in Canada were able to change jobs quickly)\n* Is 2 years of education in Canada is considered a career gap?\n* would you prefer a candidate with a stable visa status than temporary work permit?\n* As it's now almost 3 years gap, what would you suggest me to do?\n* I heard from a few friends that as there is no Canadian experience, profile is not getting shortlisted. Is this a factor you consider? how do i get this if no one is ready to offer a job.\n\nAny help is really appreciated",
