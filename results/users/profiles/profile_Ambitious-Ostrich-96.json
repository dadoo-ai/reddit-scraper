My base salary is $170k. I have a rollover IRA that I likely opened with the money invested in a 401k from a previous employer. I just opened a Roth IRA yesterday and left its balance at zero. Here’s what I think my four options are to contribute the $14k. Are any of these correct? If so, which one is the right approach to take? If not, how should I proceed?\n\n1) open a new traditional IRA, deposit the 14k, and convert from there to Roth\n2) deposit 14k in the existing rollover IRA and convert from there to Roth\n3) deposit 14k in existing rollover or new traditional IRA and do nothing\n4) deposit 14k directly in the Roth that I opened yesterday\n\nI’m not very financially literate so thanks I’m advance for any recommendations/suggestions/support you may be able to offer ",
