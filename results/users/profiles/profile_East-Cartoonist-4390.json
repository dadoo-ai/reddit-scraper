    "body": "It seems this sub has lost the plot on what a Short Squeeze is.\n\nA short squeeze 📈 is a financial phenomenon in the stock market where a heavily shorted stock experiences a rapid price increase (as we have seen recently with FFIE) 📊. This surge forces short sellers to buy shares to cover their positions (this has not happened yet), further driving up the stock price. Here's how it happens:\n\n1. **Heavy Short Selling**: Investors borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price to pocket the difference 💰. This increases short interest.\n2. **Positive News or Catalysts**: Unexpected good news 📢, strong earnings reports 💼, or po**sitive market sentiment(t**his is happening with FFIE) can cause the stock price to rise.\n3. **Buying Frenzy**: As the price goes up 📈, short sellers face potential losses. To avoid further losses, they rush to buy back shares to cover their short positions, adding more buying pressure.

    "body": "Hi, first time posting here.\n\nI find myself happily in a strange position. I have been working with my current company for a year, mostly in a meeting-setting capacity.\n\nWhen I came onto my team, I inherited a Salesforce org that was barely being used only 4 meeting setters working within Salesforce, nobody was uploading any data, and we were using data that had been imported the latest 2 years prior; nobody knew how to upload lists, so nobody did it. Any new info that was being added was being added manually, lead by lead. Opportunities were not being converted but parked in one of our warmer ratings. Nobody knew how to convert a lead to an opportunity; nothing was set up correctly.\n\nI had spent the last year as a side project to my actual job when time allowed, making Salesforce workable for our team as we used it. We are using accounts contact and leads; we are creating opportunities, I am uploading lead lists and have Zoominfo connect to get access to leads as well. I also built out some basic KPI reports that the executive team asked for, customized fields that we wanted to have to track specific data, etc.\n\nA large problem was the breakdown of information once opportunities were created and handed off to our account executives, as they do not have access to our Salesforce. We rely heavily on the AE team's communication to know what is going on with the opportunities, and communication is generally not the best. They use Excel spreadsheets to keep track of their sales funnel, and nobody has access to those; some use notebooks.\n\nA few months ago, our executive team decided to go full steam ahead with  Salesforce. We hired a consulting firm to help with the implementation and purchased sales, marketing, and service cloud services for the 90 people who will be working in our Salesforce instance.\n\nI was made aware of this once all the decisions had been made and asked to oversee the implementation on our side as the Project Manager as I was the only one in the company who knew how to do anything within Salesforce, and with my understanding that I would become the Salesforce Admin and the end of the implementation. I accepted.\n\nAt the start of the Implementation, we hired a new Manager to oversee the sales team, but apparently, the Management team also thought that they could be a part-time Salesforce admin. This person knows nothing about Salesforce. I had to explain basic things like what leads, contacts, and accounts are within Salesforce, how to convert a lead, etc. They don't know how to make reports or even how to refresh reports that I have already made.\n\nI have made my concerns known to my manager that I  am seeing red flags from someone who says they know Salesforce but doesn't know how to do basic things or functionality that someone who has worked even 5 minutes within Salesforce should know. I have been asked multiple times if there would be enough work for a full-time Salesforce admin in our Org, and I have to constantly say yes and give them examples of why.\n\nThe executive team has now asked me to write a job description for what my salesforce admin role would encompass.\n\nOn the one hand, I am super happy about this opportunity, but on the other, I feel like I have to justify my existence at the company and am being met with doubt that this role needs to exist.\n\nMy questions to this Sub are: What are your thoughts on this? How would you approach this situation? What would you add to the job description? Do you have any feedback that might help me navigate this and come out on top?\n\nI want to add that I do not currently have a Salesforce Admin Cert, I am working on it.\n\nThanks for your insight and help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Formatting, sorry lol",
