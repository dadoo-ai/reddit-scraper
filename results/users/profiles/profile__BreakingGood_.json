    "body": "Hey all, I have been working on how to get Framepack Studio to run in \"some server other than my own computer\" because I find it extremely inconvenient to use on my own machine. It uses ALL the RAM and VRAM and still performs pretty poorly on my high spec system.\n\nNow, for the price of only $1.80 per hour, you can just run it inside of a Huggingface, on a machine with 48gb VRAM and 62GB RAM (which it will happily use every gb). You can then stop the instance at any time to pause billing.\n\nUsing this system, it takes only about 60 seconds of generation time per 1 second of video at maximum supported resolution.\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have git installed, if you don't, I recommend ChatGPT to get you set up.\n\nHere is how I do it:\n\n* Go to [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/) and create an account\n* Click on \"Spaces\" in the top menu bar\n* Click on \"New Space\" in the top right\n* Name is whatever you want\n* Select 'Gradio'\n* Select 'Blank' for the template\n* For hardware, you will need to select something that has a GPU. The CPU only option will not work. For testing, you can select the cheapest GPU. For maximum performance, you will want the Nvidia 1xL40s instance, which is $1.80 per hour.\n* Set it to Private\n* Create a huggingface token here: [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and give it Write permission\n* Use the git clone command that they provide, and run it in windows terminal. It will ask for your username and password. Username will be your huggingface username. Password will be the token you got in the previous step.\n* It will create a folder with the same name as what you chose\n* Now, git clone framepack studio or download the zip: [https://github.com/colinurbs/FramePack-Studio#](https://github.com/colinurbs/FramePack-Studio#)\n* Copy all of the files from framepack studio to the folder you created when huggingface (except the .git folder, if you have one) \n* Now, locate the file 'requirements.txt' we need to add some additional dependencies so it can run in Huggingface\n* Add all of these items as new lines to the file\n   * sageattention==1.0.6\n   * torchaudio\n   * torchvision\n   * torch&gt;=2.0.0\n   * spaces\n   * huggingface\\_hub\n* Now update the [readme.md](http://readme.md) file to contain the following information (include the --- lines)\n   * \\---\n   * title: framepack\n   * app\\_file: [studio.py](http://studio.py)\n   * pinned: false\n   * sdk: gradio\n   * sdk\\_version: \"5.25.2\"\n   * \\---\n* Now do \\`git add .\\` and \\`git commit -m 'update dependencies'\\` and \\`git push\\`\n* Now the huggingface page will update and you'll be good to go\n* The first run will take a long time, because it downloads models and gets them all set up. You can click the 'logs' button to see how things are going.\n* The space will automatically stop running when it reaches the \"automatically sleep timeout\" that you set. Default is 1 hour. However, if you're done and ready to stop it manually, you can go to 'settings' and click 'pause'. When you're ready to start again, just unpause it.\n\nNote, storage in huggingface spaces is considered 'ephemeral' meaning, it can basically disappear at any time. When you create a video you like, you should download it, because it may not exist when you return. If you want persistent storage, there is an option to add it for $5/mo in the settings though I have not tested this.",

But Midjourney is still the undisputed king for me, and I like to ask around here every 6-12 months to see if anybody else has found anything even somewhat close to the quality of Midjourney. SD3.5 showed amazing promise for this purpose but unfortunately I find the base model too frequently just lets me down (and don't see any finetunes yet)\n\nWhat's your favorite model for illustrated landscapes?\n\nIn all my research so far, my favorite is this model [https://civitai.com/models/454462/copaxponyxl](https://civitai.com/models/454462/copaxponyxl)\n\nWhich produces outputs like this, but there are a lot of downsides to it:\n\n* Being pony based is a big downside for landscape models, as danbooru prompting is obviously not great for this style of image.\n* It seems to be unaffected by style LoRAs for some reason.\n* The colors are just bland and it's impossible to improve them. I think this is another side-effect of Pony. Polluted, foggy, yellow hue on every image. (This happens on almost all local models I've tried, not just this one.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3w0pmgg5sge1.jpg?width=1216&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d607692c23ceab39a7b07a1043c4310fa19fe718\n\nWith the release of Illustrious, the polluted, yellow clouds begin to part.

The quality is excellent. Admittedly, it's a little busy and noisy.

    "body": "I just spend many many hours searching the internet trying to figure out how to get a standard .mp4 video into Ogg Theora format (the only supported format for godot video players) in a quality that isn't garbage.\n\nThere are tutorials out there for exporting from VLC, but the quality is abysmal and not usable. I almost gave up. There does exist a Godot extension to enable ffmpeg support in Godot, but after using it, I was skeptical of the quality &amp; cross platform support and did not feel comfortable using it in my game, I prefer the tested out-of-the-box Godot functionality. \n\nHere are the steps to convert an mp4 file (or really any video file) into an Ogg Theora file in good quality:\n\n* Step 1, Download ffmpeg, this is a popular open source tool for all things video related. It will do our conversion. \n   * [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)\n   * If you're using Windows, you need the binary. I'm not sure if these links will change in the future, but today they go to this website [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) \n   * Go there, and locate the link that says `ffmpeg-git-full.7z`\n   * After downloading, open the archive, and keep opening folders until you see the `bin` folder\n   * Inside the bin folder, copy ffmpeg.exe out and store it somewhere\n* Step 2, put your source video file (that you want to convert) into the same folder as the ffmpeg.exe file\n* Step 3, open Windows Powershell and navigate to that folder \n* Step 4, here is the ffmpeg command to run, some notes:\n   * You need to change the words `source_video.mp4` to the name of your source file\n   * The output file will be `output_video.ogv`\n   * There are some parameters in this script.\n      *  The number `v 10` represents your video quality. 10 is the maximum. If you have a long video, this can produce a very very huge file. You may need to reduce this number if the output is too large. Reducing the number will reduce quality and file size\n      * The number `a -1` represents the audio quality. -1 means it will remove the audio. 10 is the maximum. You can adjust this number too. The current command below will remove audio. If you don't need audio, I recommend removing it to improve performance\n* Run this command in powershell `.\\ffmpeg -i source_video.mp4 -c:v libtheora -q:v 10 -c:a libvorbis -q:a -1 output_video.ogv`\n* Your output\\_video.ogv will be a video file that you can use with Godot. Note that .ogv files are much larger than .mp4 files, so your file size could increase by as much as 10x. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCongratulation and I hope this helps somebody ",
