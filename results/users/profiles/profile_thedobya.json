Let's assume that the team that is on top is three times better than every other team in the top eight. So for every four games they play, they win three, against any opposition. So their odds of winning any game is 75%, for simplicity. Not an unreasonable assumption given home ground advantage etc.\n\nSo that means that if you consider the finals series as a whole, the odds of that top team winning are:\n\nMaking it to a prelim odds:\n\nWin first game = 3/4 or 0.75\nLosing first game the winning the second= 0.25* 0.75  = 3/16 or 0.182\n\nMeaning the chance you make it to the prelim is 15/16 or about 92%. Great start.\n\nSo now odds of winning the next two games are simply 0.75* 0.75 since it's knockout. Multiplying that by the percentage of getting to the prelim in the first place, and you get about 52%.\n\nThat means that almost half of the time, despite being a much better team that everyone else, you don't win the cup.\n\nGiven there are seven other teams in it and if ANY of them win, you lose, then it's clear to see how this can come about. And this isn't even taking into account things like - for the Swans, the granny will always be away, likely against a big VIC club. Despite being top of the ladder by three games at this point. A percentage of 0.75 seems high in those circumstances.\n\nMy overall point being that if the Swans don't win this year, it's not choking or any crazy indictment on them. It's that only one team out of 18 can win and you have to be both good and lucky to have a year when it all falls into place.\n\nNow if we were talking a best of seven series like the NBA, different story. That whole setup means the better team wins more often. But we play a one game knockout, so you better turn up!\n\nThank you for reading my rant :)",

Since we all spend much more time upstairs we didn't want to have her live downstairs, so we came up with a solution...build out a cat enclosure outside, which she can access via the window. There's artificial grass we laid outside and some ledges down the side of the house she can use to do down. Her litter lives in a little kennel outside. Perfect!\n\nFor the first few months she went to pee and poo outside exclusively. Oddly she didn't use the litter, just went ourside on the astroturf. I cleaned it up every week or so.\n\nBut then something must have changed. She started peeing on the bathmat inside, and pooing in the house. We have closed all the relevant doors but she still wants to go in the house, in a corner. I've occasionally carried her downstairs to the enclosure and put her in, and she will go there then. But while she often goes outside she seems to prefer going inside now on the floor.\n\nSome extra info:\n\n* An outside ledge collapsed a while ago which I've fixed. Maybe that scared her?\n* It's now winter and while we still have days which top out at 23 degrees here (65ish Fahrenheit) maybe she doesn't want to go out at night because it's colder?\n* We have a dog too which hassles her when she is peeing or pooing which would normally mean she looked for a quieter space. So unsure why she is going inside.

As the commenter above said, there is no way to make that work as well as html. Do you see websites which are only images? No. There are a few reasons why, but one of them is that it&amp;#39;s not accessible and it doesn&amp;#39;t degrade from perfect conditions well at all. There is no world in which this would be considered best practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is also likely you will be penalised by spam filters since they can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; the content as well, but that is perhaps more anecdotal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if you don&amp;#39;t have anyone who can code HTML but you do have a Photoshop designer, who is already creating similar images for other channels, and speed is of the essence (daily sends or similar) then you do see it occurring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "Posting here instead of a comment since some might be interested. My opinion only and happy to be corrected! \n\nSo my understanding of what Warm Tunas is doing is:\n\n1. Monitoring socials for the triple J hashtag.\n\n2. Using code to automatically scrape the text from the image (something like this, not as hard as it sounds these days: https://medium.com/artificialis/how-to-extract-text-from-any-image-with-deep-learning-e834d5a9863e)\n\n3. Making your own database of votes and ranking them\n\n4. Based on the number of votes last year, estimating  what percentage of the vote you have in your database compared to the full list, and then estimating how accurate your predictions will be.\n\nFor step 4, think of it like this. Let's say there is a bucket of red and blue balls. 100 balls in total. You're asked to tell me how many blue balls are in there. After you pick out three balls, with two blue and one red, would you be confident telling me that there are around 66 blues in there? No. But if you'd drawn out 30 balls, and 20 are blue, you would be a lot more confident. And if you've drawn out 90, with 60 blue, you would be very confident you will be very close to the \"true\" number.\n\nThink of the blue balls (ha!) as the number one song. As Warm Tunas tracks more votes, it gets more confident in it's predictions for the songs, especially for the more popular ones, and especially if the margins between them are large. \n\nSo as far as I know, there are no mathematical \"tricks\" - it's called drawing samples from a population. The only thing to watch out for would be if people who post their votes are more likely to vote for particular songs. For example, if a large amount of boomers voted for particular songs but never posted, that will mean it's less accurate. To some extent you can't remove all of that bias but realistically it is unlikely to make much difference. \n\nHope this helps!",

There have been some previous threads on this from years past, but looking to crowdsource some new great Hottest 100 party ideas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps something like: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We pick three songs that are sure to place highly (eg. Angel of 8th, driver&amp;#39;s licence, Kiss Me More) and everyone has to pick what spot they will get. The person who gets the closest overall gets to allocate three shots or something&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hottest 100 Bingo: create bingo cards with the top 50 or so popular songs - first to hit bingo wins &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Standard drinking games if your song is chosen, that sort of thing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suggestions / thoughts? Bonus points for creative games based on how the Hottest 100 will shape up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We would like separate accounts of our own, and a joint account for shared stuff like groceries and rent.\n2. Private health. I previously had it, but reading a lot of the stuff here seems like it might not be worth the cost. I'll be earning $80-$100k and she will be $60-80k. Both early thirties and healthy, but want kids in 2-3 years. Given she is a Kiwi, she isn't immediately eligible for Medicare right? We will be married in March 2020 so that will likely change it I'm guessing?\n\nThoughts? Thanks in advance.",
