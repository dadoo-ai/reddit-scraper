They have options for renters and owners.  A friend of mine just got their house insulated as a renter for free. I got mine done a couple years ago and I’m saving hundreds every month on my heating bills. Not sure if you rent her own but they should also offer programs for efficient heaters windows, etc. with great discounts and financing options. But definitely start with a free home energy assessment.  They’ll bring the thermal cameras others are suggesting and give you a professional plan. And it won’t cost you a dime. Good luck and stay warm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
