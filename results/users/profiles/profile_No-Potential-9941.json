    "body": "Hi , u 31(f) &amp; my husband 31m having been married for 18 months. We have been talking about wanting kids . But he likes living extravagant and I frugal. Our combined income is Roun 4.5lakhs [ w -2.6+1.9 h] .  \nThe problem is if we have kid. Atleast 3 years I may not be able to concentrate on my career  . Which I can't afford as it's very competitive and won't let me take a step back   .u can't afford a break as I don't have generational wealth And my husband was never taught living less than ur means .  I don't know if I want a kid now or not . My husband is neutral in this . He is ok either way as it will give him flexibility to keep living extravagantly   . Foreign trips  ,outside food , gated community apartments etc ... I Always wanted kids before marriage but don't want them to struggle for everything like I did(studied in govt school lived on scholarship and mons income while studying ). \n\nI know double income no kids (dink) is popular now. Am I making mistake . Will I regret later \n. Before marriage it was like my goal have a house, gold and backup money ,good husband and kid . Now My husband thinks not having kid would free us from lot of commitments saving money for kids.and time for trips ., luxury and no burden. He don't want to live beyond 60 either . It's opposite wat I had in my mind but with economy and uncertainty of jobs  . Am not sure ...my husband's idea feels more lucrative as days pass. \n\n\nJust to add for all the comments. I know my husband will be good with kids. As I usually babysit my sisters kid and they have great rapo. My nephew adores him. He is good and patient with them . Heck he is patient with me also even though I'm short tempered . Am worried is about Financials as I have always been a miser but wen it comes to my nephew and husband I go all out . Yes he doesn't help out around house until I nag so am not sure how I ll manage .",

    "body": "I completely understand your situation. I’ve been in a remarkably similar position, and it feels almost uncanny how alike our experiences are. Due to my circumstances, I had to teach myself to be financially savvy and frugal. The person I was considering had many good qualities—he was intelligent, patient, and compassionate. However, his financial situation wasn’t ideal. At the time, I didn’t fully grasp the extent of his financial challenges, but I had a sense that things weren’t in great shape.\n\nWhat tipped the scales for me was comparing him to other prospects, who had their own set of issues—problematic behavior, controlling in-laws, or incompetence. Given the options, I felt that this was the lesser of the evils. I hoped that by marrying him, I could help stabilize the financial situation and teach him to be more disciplined with money. It wasn’t an easy decision, but I went ahead with it.\n\nIt’s been three years now, and if you ask me whether I think my decision was right, I’d say yes. For me, mental peace has been the biggest win. While finances are still a work in progress, I’ve learned that you can’t build a fortress in a day or a year. There are days when I question whether I can truly help him change his financial habits, but you have to choose your battles wisely.\n\nI’m not here to offer you solutions, but I do want to share some factors that might help you make your decision:\n\n1. *In-laws' influence*: If his parents are used to treating him like a \"raja beta\" and are partly responsible for his financial ignorance, it could be challenging to change the status quo. Consider whether he can think independently and isn’t overly tied to his family’s opinions.\n2. *Siblings and responsibilities*: How much responsibility will he have towards his siblings or family members? This could impact your financial planning.\n3. *Can he be influenced?*: From what you’ve described, it seems like he might be open to change. Does he have the right attitude to distinguish right from wrong?\n4. *Financial safety net*: Think about whether you can afford to support him if he runs into trouble. It might be wise to keep a separate fund for such scenarios.\n\nIn marriage, perfection isn’t guaranteed. You won’t find a perfect partner, but what matters is how you both work together towards your future and goals. Once you make a decision, it’s essential to accept it and move forward.",
