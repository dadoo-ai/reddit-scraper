    "communityName": "r/salesforce",
    "parsedCommunityName": "salesforce",
    "body": "We 'bought' Agentforce for our org and wanted to share the exact pricing.\n\nIn theory, you can buy Agentforce in your Salesforce org by going to the \"My Account\" section of Setup, browsing, and adding it to your cart. However, clicking Add to Cart just told us to contact support, and after a few back and forth emails with support where they explained to us we could add it to our cart (duh) we got through to our AE who sent us a contract. I recommend just talking to your AE in the first place :-)\n\nThe contract was interesting. There were 4 lines added to our annual subscription at a 0 monthly cost.\n\n1. Salesforce Foundations\n2. Salesforce Foundations - Data Cloud Segmentation &amp; Activation\n3. Salesforce Foundations - Agentforce Service Agent\n4. Data Cloud Provisioning\n\nBelow that was the actual cost we would pay on a per-usage basis. This was pretty confusing at first because there was both a price and a quantity. And then below it I saw this line:\n\n&gt;Usage Billing: Usage beyond the Quantity specified for each Usage Type prior to the applicable End Date is subject to the Billing Model and corresponding Usage Rate for that Usage Type.\n\nAhhh, so the quantity was my free usage, and the price was how much I would pay above that.\n\nI can't add screenshots to this reddit post, so if you want to see screenshots of this with the exact free amounts and price after the free amounts are used, I wrote up a larger blog post around this, [https://breadwinner.com/agentforce-pricing-explained/](https://breadwinner.com/agentforce-pricing-explained/)\n\nHere are the 5 Quantity based line items:\n\n1. Segments and Activations Credits\n2. **Conversations** (billed at $2.50 in arrears)\n3. **Einstein Requests**\n4. Data Storage (GB) (we got a Terabyte)\n5. Data Services Credits\n\nI don't think the typical company is going to hit the 1 Terabyte storage limit, or blow through our PDF Processing limits, and the Segmentation costs are more for marketing cloud usage. So I'm going to ignore those and focus on the two bold lines: Conversations and Einstein Requests.\n\n**Internal Pricing to Salesforce Users**\n\nWhat's interesting is that a Conversation, when used internally by staff, is not reset to a new conversation until 24 hours of inactivity. That means an employee who asks Einstein a few questions every business day might not have 24 hours of inactivity until the weekend. So they *might only incur four conversations a month*. So bizarrely, heavy use every day by internal staff might cost *less for conversations* than someone who only asks a few questions every other day.\n\nSo heavy use by an internal Salesforce User could be 4 conversations a month (4 x $2.50 = $10), whereas light use could be 10 conversations a month (10 x $2.50 = $25). So the conversation pricing model rewards those who constantly use it!\n\nHowever, there are also Einstein Requests. The calculation for this is quite complicated, and I dive into it further in my [blog post](https://breadwinner.com/agentforce-pricing-explained/), but a rough estimate is 2 cents a reply. So asking the agent 100 questions a day could easily cost $2 per day in Einstein Requests. So your heavy user would cost $50 a month total (Conversations and Einstein Requests) vs the light user of just $25-$27 (effectively, just Conversations).\n\nThe free allowance I got was only 1000 conversations total, across Production and Sandbox orgs (yes, Sandbox orgs count to your billing statements). After that 1-time allowance of 1000 conversations, the billing-in-arrears starts.\n\n~~Keep in mind that you get 1000 conversations a month, so you can imagine a company with 100 Salesforce Users (or less), with conversations that average 10 responses or less, never having to pay anything, ever. So for a small company using Salesforce, using Agentforce seems like an amazing freemium product that might never cost anything.~~ *\\[Edited to correct this. 1000 Convos for free is just once ever, not monthly. Thank you to the people who pointed this out!\\]*\n\n**External Pricing to Partners and Customers**\n\nWith External customers and partners, Salesforce is hoping that its conversations will reduce the cost of your support team far more than the cost of Agentforce. A typical service agent might be able to handle 20-50 support conversations a day. If Agentforce initiates all of those conversations, that's $50-$125 a day. If the support team has all-in salary costs of $200-$400 a day, then it's easy to see how Agentforce could easily save the company money.\n\n**Haggling the price down**\n\nAll of my costs listed above and in the screenshots are for monthly billing in arrears. Salesforce would love for you to give them money ahead of time, and no doubt the cost per-conversation could fall to $2 or lower, rather than the $2.50 for arrears.\n\n**UPDATE - JAN 10 2025**\n\nSo we got our first monthly billing email from Salesforce! I've taken screenshots and added those to the blog post. The link is above in this post.\n\nThere are five lines for the five main products. And then another section for Usage SubTypes",

Thank you to the people who pointed this out!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Pricing to Partners and Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With External customers and partners, Salesforce is hoping that its conversations will reduce the cost of your support team far more than the cost of Agentforce. A typical service agent might be able to handle 20-50 support conversations a day. If Agentforce initiates all of those conversations, that&amp;#39;s $50-$125 a day. If the support team has all-in salary costs of $200-$400 a day, then it&amp;#39;s easy to see how Agentforce could easily save the company money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haggling the price down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of my costs listed above and in the screenshots are for monthly billing in arrears. Salesforce would love for you to give them money ahead of time, and no doubt the cost per-conversation could fall to $2 or lower, rather than the $2.50 for arrears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE - JAN 10 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we got our first monthly billing email from Salesforce! I&amp;#39;ve taken screenshots and added those to the blog post. The link is above in this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are five lines for the five main products. And then another section for Usage SubTypes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "Hah! Many are indeed. And there's a clear reason for this.\n\nDuring the sales cycle of many SaaS products, the prospect asks, \"Do you integrate with Salesforce?\" and the salesperson *needs* to say yes and they will. Engineering will bang out anything that ticks the box, including a half-baked Zapier or Workato integration, a visual-only Visual Force integration that doesn't actually move data, or rely on a third party.\n\nIntuit has TWICE built and then abandoned its Salesforce integration with QuickBooks Online. I expect them to build and their third Salesforce integration once all the executives scarred from the last integration leave the company and are replaced by wide-eyed optimistic execs who boldly proclaim that they will build a working integration for Salesforce and QuickBooks Online! And they will fail a third time.\n\nThe truth is that the day an ISV app gets its first paying customer is the day the app is about 10% complete.

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hah! Many are indeed. And there&amp;#39;s a clear reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the sales cycle of many SaaS products, the prospect asks, &amp;quot;Do you integrate with Salesforce?&amp;quot; and the salesperson &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to say yes and they will. Engineering will bang out anything that ticks the box, including a half-baked Zapier or Workato integration, a visual-only Visual Force integration that doesn&amp;#39;t actually move data, or rely on a third party.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intuit has TWICE built and then abandoned its Salesforce integration with QuickBooks Online. I expect them to build and their third Salesforce integration once all the executives scarred from the last integration leave the company and are replaced by wide-eyed optimistic execs who boldly proclaim that they will build a working integration for Salesforce and QuickBooks Online! And they will fail a third time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the day an ISV app gets its first paying customer is the day the app is about 10% complete. Breadwinner has built dedicated integrations with NetSuite, QuickBooks Online, and Xero, and I&amp;#39;d estimate that roughly 80-90% of the product, codebase, support, and documentation were all built &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; our first paying customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the challenge is that naive execs at companies pay PDOs to &amp;#39;build&amp;#39; an integration as if it&amp;#39;s a toaster.

We're so different that half the time we're complements to an ETL. \n\nHeck, our biggest customer is an all-Boomi shop with multiple internal full-time Boomi admins. If they were to replicate Breadwinner's functionality with Boomi, they'd likely need an internal FTE at minimum, and maybe a second person in case the first person left. That's an insane salary cost compared to our subscription (and our subscription doesn't get sick or take a holiday).\n\nBecause we have seen (almost) every edge case already over 1000+ NetSuite/QuickBooks/Xero customers, we have included business logic into the product that delivers functionality you just couldn't build on a customer-by-customer ETL integration.\n\nBecause one of our specialties is replicating NetSuite data to Salesforce, the customer request of \"Oh, and you also need to bring X, Y, and Z over from NetSuite\" is handled with \"We do that the first day.\" Sometimes, that data replication even allows further savings on license costs from other vendors.\n\nAnd as SQLDevDBA said, time to value is indeed crazy good! :-)\n\nHope that helps!

They hire Celigo consultants for 20-60 billable days...and often get something mostly adequate but that they aren&amp;#39;t in love with. After struggling with their ETL/iPaaS integration, they discover that they would have been better off going with a different category of integrations.
