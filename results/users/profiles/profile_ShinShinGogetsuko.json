    "body": "My LG 27GR95QE-B (the 27\" OLED...horrible naming schemes) arrived a couple days ago, so I wanted to post some thoughts after living with it for a few days. Bear in mind, I'm not a professional monitor reviewer, just someone who games in the evening.\n\nI can see why this is a divisive monitor. I had to rethink my entire monitor setup after playing with it. My office has three windows and a door, so *tons* of light comes in during the day, but thankfully none of it is direct due to the eaves of my roof.\n\nWhen I first fired it up, I had it next to my Dell S2719DGF (a 27\" 1440p 144hz monitor) and besides some beautiful transitions in the darker areas, the OLED blacks weren't particularly impressive due to the matte coating. The matte coating itself is nicely done, and it's [comparable with my Dell](https://i.imgur.com/6oSw0fs.jpg), which is in contrast to some of the review I've read of the LG. So, if you're a fan of matte coatings, it's at least a good one (IMO).\n\nThe brightness is as dim as people are claiming. I'm running it at 85 brightness, and that's as low as I could go during the day without the monitor being annoyingly dim. At night, I can go lower. At 85-100 brightness, personally I find it very usable during the day and don't have any complaints about the brightness. If I had direct sunshine on the monitor, it'd be a problem for sure. There's just a whole range of brightness where the display is essentially useless.\n\nIn the evening, I discovered that this thing is absolutely gorgeous. The clarity and responsiveness of the image is stunning, all the way from 144 hz to 240 hz. The size is absolutely perfect. The other display I considered was the 42\" C2, but I mocked it out with some cardboad and it would've been way too big. I switch between gaming with a gamepad and keyboard+mouse, some while 42\" is fine for gamepad, it's too uncomfortable up close for KB+M play. Personally, I also feel that matte coating issues abate in the evening. This monitor is gorgeous for gaming. \n\nLike I said, the idea was to use the LG as the **primary** monitor for my gaming PC, but after spending the day with it, I had to change that. I hooked my gaming PC to both the LG and my work display, a Dell S2722QC7 (a 27” 4K 60Hz monitor). This way, I can do all my productivity on the Dell, but use the LG in the evenings for gaming.\n\n[Final setup pic](https://i.imgur.com/BGY52zm.jpg).\n\n**TLDR;** really know your use case for this monitor. If it's primarily gaming, and you don't mind the matte coating, go for it (though, I really feel this monitor is more palpable at say, $799). If you want to do any productivity on it, I highly recommend using a secondary monitor for that. The alternative is go for the 42\" C2 and be comfortable with the size, or just wait for more OLED monitors to hit the market.",

    "body": "We performed a major renovation on our 1924 home in the past year. One of the things we did was turn a bedroom into a master bathroom, right off a new master suite. \n\nDuring the construction of the bathroom, OSB was put over an existing slat floor so that the final floor would be level with the wooden flooring of the master bedroom. On top of the new OSB, the tile guy put down Schluter Ditra and then 12 x 12 marble tiles (the selection of our designer).\n\nThe tile was installed in July '21, and by September '21, I noticed a [large white line appear](https://i.imgur.com/EwqweM6.jpg) on the marble floor tile right in front of the toilet area. At first, I thought perhaps it was a scratch made when they installed the cabinets, but by December '21, it had spread all over the bathroom, going in straight lines exactly along the joints of the OSB subfloor. Turns out these white lines are actually fissures in the marble tiles, created by pressure underneath.\n\n[Crack running along subfloor joints](https://i.imgur.com/DxnLVy8.jpg)\n\n[Enhance](https://i.imgur.com/hErz12d.jpg)\n\n[Crack in front of clawfoot tub](https://i.imgur.com/BGQIKXN.jpg)\n\n[Crack alongside toilet](https://i.imgur.com/iS7CKWQ.jpg)\n\nI reported this to the general contractor in January '22. To try to shorten the length of this saga a bit, it took over eight months of calling, emailing, talking to a lawyer and reminding the GC of his legal obligation to remedy the issue. During that time, we even had a Ditra rep come out, and he didn't think it was a Ditra failure (which I agree). It's pretty obvious that it was a subfloor failure.\n\nAnyway, the GC finally got his tile guy--the original installer--to come out this week and begin addressing the issue. However, now I'm encountering a few new problems. The tile guy, rather than fixing every cracked tile, say he only wants to replace the ones he can easily pry up because he doesn't want deal with taking out the toilet and claw foot tub. They demoed a bunch of tiles, noticing that some parts of the subfloor have crowned at the joints, while other joints have \"voids.\" They fix these issues, screw down the subfloor more, put down new Ditra and install new marble tiles.\n\nSo here is where my first issue comes in, now that I've cleaned up the floor a bit, it looks like the tiles he used don't quite match the same as the originals. I don't know if it's my imagination, but they look more gray than the original marble. That said, there's a ton of variation in marble so I have no idea if I'm crazy or not.\n\n[Can you tell which tiles are new and which are original?](https://i.imgur.com/739DNac.jpg)\n\n[Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/h3JMWWA.jpg)\n\nThe second issue is some of the joints between the new tile [look a little...crappy](https://i.imgur.com/QNpWOTx.jpg)? Maybe this will look better once grout is applied. (And to be fair, I don't really notice it from standing height.)\n\nThe final issue is one I encountered the first time they laid the tile. I found a bunch of [this non-literal shit](https://i.imgur.com/jVUKNPk.jpg) inside my toilet. I'm pretty sure it's mortar. I suspect it's dust getting into the toilet and hardening, but [oh what do my eyes see](https://i.imgur.com/Jv2bdXe.jpg) after they laid the tile yesterday. Really annoys me that this is happening.\n\nGuess I'm just wondering if I'm being unreasonable to say, stop the work until 1) you fix every cracked tile and 2) use tiles that match exactly. I had to threaten to sue the CG for him to make the issue right, and it feels that they're only half-assing the repair. I'm just so tired and frustrated of dealing with this issue, and I'm beyond sick of dealing with this contractor.",

I think some injection texturing on the grips, like the new Xbox Series controllers, would make the Deck feel slightly less slippery and even more comfortable to hold.\n* **Relocate grip seam**: Another thing that has stood out to me is the seam for the front and back shells that runs through the grip area. You can sort of feel this in your palm as you hold the Deck. It'd be nice if they could reroute this so that the entire grip feels uniform in your palm.\n* **More concave analog sticks**: probably controversial as PS gamers might like convex sticks more. I like concave sticks, so I wish the existing analog sticks were a bit more concave as my fingers roll off them fairly easily. Perhaps as more companies make replacement sticks, this will be a simple replacement rather than having to incorporate it into a hardware revision.\n* **More prominent L1/L2 buttons**: the buttons are contoured into the L2/R2 buttons, so it actually makes them kinda hard to notice and press. I'd like to see these more squared off so that you can make them out with your fingers better.\n* **Smaller screen bezels**: Enough said, lots of people have mentioned this in the past months. If they could somehow cut the bezels down on the LCD, I imagine they could make the whole Deck about 3/4\" shorter.\n* **OLED?**: this would be nice, too. That said, I don't really have any complaints about the existing screen. OLED would do wonders for black levels, though.\n* **Relocate Steam button**: I didn't realize how much you actually have to use the Steam button for various functions. Given this, it means you're rotating your thumb 90 degrees away from the d-pad and analog stick a LOT. It'd be nice to have it somewhere higher up.

    "body": "Back in 2018, Xbox put out an ID@Xbox trailer to showcase some upcoming indie games for Xbox and PC. A [very short clip](https://youtu.be/GmPwo5SL5Vw?t=100) clip of a game called \"The Wind Road\" captured my attention and I spent the next year or so wondering what become of it, as I never saw a release on Xbox.\n\nThe game eventually dropped on Steam in July 2020, and incidentally, never made it over to Xbox despite that early marketing. It’s basically like a Wuxia adventure/RPG-lite set in historical China, an interesting setting since I’ve never played a game set in that period. \n\nI finally picked it up this month and played through the whole thing. Right off the bat, undersand that this is a pretty janky game. It was made by a small studio and there is text in the game that haven’t been translated to English, or translations that aren’t grammatically correct. It doesn't make a huge difference in the grand scheme of understanding the story, thankfully, as all the big stuff is translated well enough. The game also ends on a sort of cliffhanger, so I'm guessing there may be sequels down the road? It's hard to find English-language information on the game or the developer.\n\nWhere the game really excels is in the art design and combat system. The scenery and texture work throughout is just fantastic. The game is divided into chapters, with each chapter taking place in a large zone, and each feels like a distinct experience. \n\n[Here's a gallery of screenshots that I took](https://imgur.com/a/Q2e3Nvl)\n\nThe combat is really fun. You can have multiple styles, from using your fists to multiple styles of beautiful and acrobatic swordplay. Four can be active at once and you can use the dpad to switch between them on the fly. You can parry some incoming attacks, and if you get it right you can trigger an instant attack back for some mega damage to your foes. Besides the goons that you fight doing the main storyline and quests, there’s a bunch of bosses that you’ll need to defeat to advance the story. Overall, the combat feels a bit like Devil May Cry with a very small touch of Dark Souls (really only the parry mechanic).\n\nThe game runs on Unity, and looked great at 1440p 144 Hz on Ultra. As with most Unity engine games, there is some strange frametime stutter here and there, which contributes to the overall feeling of jankiness, along with the two or three random crashes I had just playing the game. Other strangeness? There’s no shadows on NPC characters, despite some otherise great art designs and lighting design. Also, the button mapping is really wonky, with LB being your primary interaction button versus the de facto face buttons. Jump is mapped to R3 of all things. You can remap certain keys so it doesn’t really get in the way, but it’s strange nonetheless.\n\n\nWould I recommend it? Tough call. It’s a pretty average game but I enjoyed my time with it if only for the setting and combat. I played it like an casual adventure game; if I had played it on hard and really focused on the gameplay I'd probably be more critical. If you can ignore some of the rough edges you may find this a good time.",

Overall, the combat feels a bit like Devil May Cry with a very small touch of Dark Souls (really only the parry mechanic).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game runs on Unity, and looked great at 1440p 144 Hz on Ultra. As with most Unity engine games, there is some strange frametime stutter here and there, which contributes to the overall feeling of jankiness, along with the two or three random crashes I had just playing the game. Other strangeness? There’s no shadows on NPC characters, despite some otherise great art designs and lighting design. Also, the button mapping is really wonky, with LB being your primary interaction button versus the de facto face buttons. Jump is mapped to R3 of all things. You can remap certain keys so it doesn’t really get in the way, but it’s strange nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would I recommend it? Tough call. It’s a pretty average game but I enjoyed my time with it if only for the setting and combat. I played it like an casual adventure game; if I had played it on hard and really focused on the gameplay I&amp;#39;d probably be more critical. If you can ignore some of the rough edges you may find this a good time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

(I'm playing the original 2007 release, not the Ultimate Edition.)\n\nRunning it at 1440p60 is a fantastic experience. Textures (at least in the near field) are sharp, controls feel a lot more responsive. It's really hard to see how I tolerated 720p with an unsteady 20-30 fps back in the 2006.\n\nThe one thing about the visual look of this game that I can't stand--and in fact gives me a headache given enough time--is the Unreal Engine 3 post-processing. Set aside the muted color palette, since that's an art decision I can live with. The post-processing effects like depth of field make it seem like any medium-to-far distance has a horrible blur all over it and very low contrast.\n\nYou can turn it off in one of the .ini's, but from what I can see, turning it off turns off *all* post-processing effects like bloom and makes the whole image universally brighter. Everything is sharper, which is wonderful, but still lacks contrast.\n\nHas anyone come up with a good solution for tweaking the image? I'm considering messing with reshade to see if I can give the image more contrast without turning off the post-processing entirely.\n\nEDIT--here's an [example](https://imgur.com/a/GjEEfo7) of what I'm talking about.

First, some of the gutters are holding water after some big rain storms that we've had recently. I would think they should be angled so that water flows toward the downspouts.\n\nSecond, on the existing portion, they used a different style bracket to mount the gutters rather than the half-round hangers that they used on the addition area. I assume they did this because there's a piece of decorative trim that would prevent them from getting the half-round backets on.

    "body": "I had the itch to play through the Rare Donkey Kongs lately, having enjoyed DKC 1 and 2 back in the day on SNES. I spent the past month playing through all three, plus Donkey Kong 64.\n\nI absolutely adored the first one, and enjoyed the second one, though not as much. The third and DK64 were totally new to me.\n\n* Donkey Kong Country: still a classic, and I think it's the best of the all of them. There's this wonderful rhythm to the movement, which was intentional on the designer's part. The goal was to be able to move through a level, hitting enemies without losing momentum. This shows in the design and enemy placement in almost all levels. The art style is also the most cohesive of the three games, you really get this island adventure vibe throughout the whole game.\n* Donkey Kong Country 2: the game mechanics start to get a bit more complex in this game, and it also adds collectables. In DKC1, to 100% the game, all you have to do is find all the secret areas. In DKC2, you have to find banana coins (found in secret areas), as well as DK Coins. It's not bad, and most are actually pretty fun to obtain, but stopping to hunt for the secrets lessons the rhythmic movement so important to the first game. The overall art design becomes more \"dark\", the levels themes more more random (you go from a Pirate Ship to a Lava Level to a Haunted Forest, etc). The level design is great, but later levels start to introduce frustrating mechanics or maze-like layouts. That said, it's still a great play.\n* Donkey Kong Country 3: This game is interesting because I feels like the first game where Rare really started to push collectathon gameplay. The overworld is now explorable, with secrets to find, so the whole game has a real adventure feel to it. I liked the lighter tone introduced by the \"Northern wilderness\" art style and the levels. The platforming mechanics themselves are further refined and it's fun to jump around and bonk enemies. The only issue I had with the gameplay (a common criticism for the game) is that each level typically introduces a completely new mechanic rather than refining earlier ones. And some of the later levels introduce mechanics that are far more frustrating than fun (including a level where your controls are reversed). \n* Donkey Kong 64: honestly, this game is a slog at 29 hours to 100%. I don't think it holds up today, and my urge to finish it felt masochistic. The move to 3D removed all the emphasis on the joy of movement and the game design became a collectathon taken to the max. In fact, to even beat the game, you have to complete two quite difficult classic arcade games. Behind the vast majority of these collectibles in the game are minigames, so the core gameplay is essentially wandering around levels until you find a sub-level with a minigame in it. You do this 170 or so times to be able to beat the game, and 201 times if you want to 100% the game. Most of the minigames are more frustrating than fun, and many (like the racing or mine cart levels) aren't helped by a PS4 Cyberpunk-like framerate that ranges between 15-30 fps. I did find the hub world, and some of the secrets to find there enjoyable, but overall, I don't recommend this game at all unless you like collecting more than platforming.",

    "body": "Horizon is an interesting beast to me. I'm a long-time Forza Motorsport fan, all the way back to FM2 on 360. I've 100%'d all the Motorsport games. So when Forza Horizon was announced back in 2011 or so, needless to say I was excited for an open-world, more chill Forza experience.\n\nFor the most part, I really enjoyed that first game. I had some gripes about it being 30 fps, which did change the feel and fluidity of the experience, but it delivered on the promise of a beautiful, open-world Forza. \n\nFast forward to Horizon 3 and 4. I find these games, mo reso 4, to be an increasingly frustrating experience to play. I decided after two months that I'm done trying to like Forza Horizon 4. I can appreciate that it's the larger selling Forza series, and there is a ton to like in this game, but I know it's just not for me. I find it to be a beautiful, appealing, well-engineered game, layered on some maddeningly unfun game mechanics and design choices. And it's a shame, because if there is any racing game to play, it's the gorgeous Horizon 4 (which looks and runs amazing at 1440p130 on PC).\n\nHere's are my gripes:\n\n* The biggest gripe is that there's no respect for the single player gamer. There are dozens and dozens of cars locked under time-based multiplayer events. For older gamers who play these games more to collect and cruise with cars, the game just isn't set up for that. Playground Games wants you logged in for a few hours every night, participating in their season and Forzathon structure.\n* Wheelspins and their RNG BS are awful, and really any dev that is putting in these gambling mechanics into their games should be ashamed. The only positive that I can say is that at least you don't have to use real-world money to deal with these things.\n* So if you don't have time, but still want the cars, your best option is to go to the Auction House and play Forza eBay simulator--if the car you want is even listed for sell. The auction house in general is a concept that I'm tired of seeing in the Forza series. It's as if T10 and Playground feel bad about throwing decades worth of code out. I don't see what value having a credit economy in the game adds.\n* UI barf: the UI in Horizon 3 and 4 are bloated, confusing messes. The first time you get a view of the map, the game spends a few minutes just plastering event after event on it. It's almost Ubisoft open world game levels of confusing UI.\n* Personally, I'm tired of the festival theme along with the same Euro rock and electronica music. There has been zero evolution in the music of the franchise since 2012, with no interesting stations added. At least let me stream my own tunes (which I think Horizon 3 let you do for a time).\n* From a Motorsport fan, the circuit races are boring. What's wrong with putting a proper circuit on the map? Do these fictional versions of Colorado, England, the Mediterranean, or Australia not have any racing facilities? I'm bored of a \"circuit\" being a bunch of random streets strung together by banners. Put a proper racetrack in the game to which you can drive, and then drive ON THE TRACK.\n\nAll of that adds up to make the whole experience just a frustrating mess to me, which is a huge shame, because on the surface the game has tons of features that I love: beautiful graphics, a great car list (if you can actually drive the cars), and good physics. But with each iteration, there just seems to be more unnecessary junk layered on top of those awesome core elements that just dampen the experience. So Horizon 5--sorry, I'm out. I'm looking forward to Forza Motorsport 8 and whether or not T10 brings all the improvements they made to FM7 right out of the gate.",

Can&amp;#39;t seem to find an OE part number. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/m9q4qne.jpg\"&gt;Is the rear hatch lock/handle supposed to stick out like this?&lt;/a&gt; For some reason, I thought when you unlocked the car, it is supposed to pop out. The lock seems to work but it doesn&amp;#39;t pop out and it doesn&amp;#39;t still flush.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
