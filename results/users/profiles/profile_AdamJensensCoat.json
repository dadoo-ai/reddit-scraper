    "body": "Hey all. Hoping to pick the brains of those amongst you who are warranty-savvy.\n\nMy 2016 S6 is now an Audi of a certain age. I bought her low milage with a CPO warranty, and thankfully that's covered me for a few otherwise expensive, stupid repairs. The most recent issues slid right under the coverage window, but in just a few weeks the CPO warranty expires, and I'll be flying without a net.\n\nCutting to the chase â€” Have any of you purchased an extension of your Audi CPO warranty? If so, was it the Audi dealer acting as a broker for a 3rd party warranty, or was it factory?

Hoping to pick the brains of those amongst you who are warranty-savvy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My 2016 S6 is now an Audi of a certain age. I bought her low milage with a CPO warranty, and thankfully that&amp;#39;s covered me for a few otherwise expensive, stupid repairs. The most recent issues slid right under the coverage window, but in just a few weeks the CPO warranty expires, and I&amp;#39;ll be flying without a net.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cutting to the chase â€” Have any of you purchased an extension of your Audi CPO warranty? If so, was it the Audi dealer acting as a broker for a 3rd party warranty, or was it factory? Would you purchase from dealer, or Audi USA?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s not too much to complain about, and I just bought a fresh set of Continental DWS for the winter months.

Hope you find this helpful whilst shopping the many end-of-the-world sales going on now.\n\n___\n\nCotton Jersey:\n\nYou can ID these shirts by the [black compass badge.] (https://www.stoneisland.com/us/stone-island/short-sleeve-t-shirt_cod12395919fv.html#dept=pltshrts) Thin, sheer jersey fabric. Smooth hand and wears very lightweight. Runs *very small*. You should size up +1 or even +2 with these unless you want to wear a skin-suit. Feels good on a hot day but also snags easily and is prone to causal damage. There's nothing extra special about these you'll probably feel unimpressed if you drop $150. Also, if you buy this in white, be prepared for your nips to show through. The fabric is noticeably thin when its undyed.\n\n(Note: If you find some older versions of these shirts from pre-2018, the quality is really good. My older shirts hold up like tanks. Sadly, SI has made recent compromises with this fabric.)\n\n___\n\n\"Fissato Effect\" Cotton Jersey:\n\n*These are the ones you want*. You can ID these [shirts] (https://www.stoneisland.com/sk/stone-island/short-sleeve-t-shirt_cod12472893wi.html#dept=llprdcts) by the [object-dyed light compass badge.] (https://feature.com/products/stone-island-fissato-effect-t-shirt-faded-olive?variant=31533745733703&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgNKv7-fr6gIVGJ3VCh31awwuEAQYAiABEgJv8_D_BwE) It's a bit confusing because SI also calls this 'Cotton Jersey' but the fabric is totally different than the Black-Compass fabric. Medium-lightweight fabric, has a more substantial hand and tend to hold up really well to abuse. SI tends to mix up the cut/pattern on these every season with some kind of different collar and yoke detailing. Fit is TTS. I'll sometimes size up +1 if I want a slightly looser fit. IMO these are always a good buy.\n\n[Another example. Great price BTW.] (https://www.vooberlin.com/men/clothing/t-shirts/stone-island/fissato-dyed-long-sleeve-t-shirt-in-beige/mo721522057-v0190?number=8056142569693)\n\n___\n\nMercerized Cotton PiquÃ©:\n\nThere's no easy way to ID these since SI is always using this fabric in different formats. They tend to have the [small embroidered star on the chest.] (https://www.stoneisland.com/us/stone-island/short-sleeve-t-shirt_cod12396699rw.html#dept=pltshrts) You can ID this by the fine, micro-waffle pattern in the fabric. This fabric is medium-weight, and maybe my least favorite of all the SI staple fabrics. The feel is slightly rough, but not quite heavy enough to feel like the tradeoff is justified. I have a few of these shirts and have found that overall the dye has a tendency not to hold well, with noticeable fading around high-wear areas like the cuffs (on a LS). The weave looks nice but IMO they just don't feel great to wear. These tend to fit TTS, but you could size up +1 if you want a looser fit.\n\n___\n\nSummary: If you feel like splurging on an SI t-shirt, seek out the [Fissato Effect Cotton Jersey.] (https://www.stoneisland.com/sk/stone-island/short-sleeve-t-shirt_cod12472893wi.html#dept=llprdcts) Quality is good and the construction is elevated beyond just a simple t-shirt.\n\nHope that was helpful.

    "title": "[Review ] First Impressions of ACG S/S18 Deploy Shorts",
    "communityName": "r/techwearclothing",
    "parsedCommunityName": "techwearclothing",
    "body": "[Full Album Here (I have a fluffy white dog. Fur warning.)] (https://imgur.com/a/bAGUEJQ)\n\n\nI've been in love with the S/S17 Cargo Shorts since they arrived this time last year. They've gone everywhere with me and have been the perfect combo of work/city/trail short that does everything pretty good. The Deploy Shorts have big shoes to fill this year since the S/S did so many things so well.\n\n\nHere's impressions after a quick trip to the Donut Shop:\n\n#Fit:\n\nI'm 6' 185lbs and usually size 32 or 33 on a good day. Went with a size M just like the last S/S17 collection.\n\nRoomy. I love it. They're even baggier than the S/S17 shorts. Go TTS. Don't even think of sizing up. [They're noticeably longer than last year's shorts.](https://i.imgur.com/AC2Yupn.jpg) Last years shorts were midlengh, but these will cover your knees unless you're really tall.\n\n\n#Material:\n\nIdentical to the material used in the F/W17 Cargo Pants. Hand is semi-sheer to the touch. 2% Spandex, 98% Cotton. I prefer last year's 3% Spandex blend. It felt more durable in contrast and, so far, has worn pretty well. Jury is out on this new 2% fabric. Doesn't feel like it will put up with abuse but DWR properties seem good.\n\n\n#Waistband:\n\nSame as last year. Elastic and on the roomy side. Belt loops are arranged the same but feel ever so slightly less sturdy than last year's shorts. Will accommodate a large belt. Why not just include a snap instead of a contiguous waistband? Maybe this is a design feature that's over my head since the waistband is large.\n\n\n#Pouches:\n\nOn to the good shit. Those pouches. They look great. To my disappointment, the pouches are not fully-removable. They're secured to the side of the shorts by a nylon 'hinge' that allows the pockets to reverse-over to secure to the lateral sides of the shorts. [No lining or extra love on the inside.](https://i.imgur.com/6raR63p.jpg) Just 1-ply of the Cotton-blend fabric.\n\n\n#Pouch Flippy Zipper System:\n\nSo you have zipper tracks fixed to the front and lateral sides of the shorts. [They look pretty cool.](https://i.imgur.com/kD70R9s.jpg) They're secured on to the front of the shorts by a YKK Vislon zipper. You can unzip the track and have the pouch fixed to your lateral side. In my head I thought I could easily flip these babies over and change pocket modes while wearing the shorts like MacGyver â€” the first couple of tries I felt like an idiot. With some practice you can master flipping these over. Not the easiest thing since there only one zipper pull - so you need to flip the pull over to the over side and by the time you've done that you might be annoyed.  If you're standing up while doing this you're gonna have a bad time. Still, for how novel the system is it's pretty cool that it works. A double-sided pull would help a ton. \n\nLooking at the zipper track I started thinking... *\"what other shit could I zip onto this track?\"*\n\n\n#Pouch Access:\n\n*In front mode*: The small front pouch opening looks really cool but is a bit of a hassle to open. I found that placing the zippers in the center makes opening the pouch easier. The nylon pull-tab is a nice touch and feels sturdy. *In side mode*: The vertical zipper does itself no favors. The placement makes it feel like stuff might fall out if  - BUT AHA - *it's the ideal placement if you're sitting down*, giving you a perfect Ziploc baggie sort of access.  So, this is one of those things where you may just have to think through what's in your pouches.\n\n\n#Pouch Room:\n\nThey don't look that big but they hold lots of stuff. [Say you need to walk around with a Scotch Tape Dispenser,](https://i.imgur.com/EMcyRyP.jpg) you're good to go. [You'll look fabulous walking around these mean streets and folks will be none the wiser.](https://i.imgur.com/yunTIPp.jpg) The real test for everyday purposes was my dog leash. I have a thick, 8ft climbing-rope leash and the pouch gobbled it up. Smart construction, gets an A+ from me.\n\n\n#Pockets:\n\n[Really bummed out by the pocket bags.] (https://i.imgur.com/mUOgz8r.jpg) The lining on the side and rear pockets is similar to the F/W Cargo Pants but even *thinner.* It's a sheer nylon(?) material and feels like it will fail under light use. I would never think of putting my keys in these pockets for fear that they'd just rip through the single-ply material. Sorta astonished that the pockets are so half-assed. Last year's shorts had cotton pocket bags that felt sturdy and held up well. It's hard to overlook this. Come think, I hate it.\n\n\nAnd sticking with the zipper theme, the side pockets have zippers... But on the downside â€” they have zippers. so it can be unpleasant if you're reaching in our just holding your hands there. Would have preferred standard pockets or a snap closure. Just doesn't feel great sticking your hands in there. On the plus side, the side pockets aren't hard to access if your pouches are in the side-position.\n\n\nAside from all that negative stuff â€” at least the pockets are really deep. Back pocket will hold a very large wallet with room to spare. Side pockets are deep as they come. They also feature the sorta-odd \"hidden coin pit\" which is like the Bermuda triangle for quarters. Other ACG pockets have this design and it's equal parts handy and infuriating.\n\n\n#DWR:\n\nNot bad. I poured a glass of water on the shorts and it just beaded right off. Much better than expected.\n\n\n#Drawstrings:\n\nACG has gone back to their standard drawstrings with red-orange ends. Contrast with the 3M, Screw-End drawstrings from last year. I like this. It's not a busy look and - as cool as the twisty-tabs were last year - the ends would fly off in the laundry or just disappear. On the other hand, you could find random things with the same gauge to add to the ties. Great for hiding shit if you're a nose candy sort of fella. Length is good.\n\n\n\n#Fly:\n\nIf you need to pee these shorts got ya covered. Like last year there's no snap, so you'll just have to maneuver your weenie straight through the zipper if that's your style. The zipper track is abnormally long â€” much appreciated.\n\n\n#Verdict:\n\nHoly shit. ACG gang killed it for $175. But...\n\n\nPocket bags are doo doo. Why make shorts that are ostensibly utilitarian and not address this?\n\n\nThe S/S17 shorts were 10/10. Material, construction and style was great for the price. Lots of \nunique features and perfect tradeoff of room, looks and functionality. Loved the ventilation panels. Hard to top.\n\n\nS/S18 Deploy Shorts are a 8/10 *only because of the damn pocket bags.* They're so thin it's annoying. I hope time proves me wrong and these pockets hold up under abuse. Slight ding for the front pouches - they look cool but opening them makes you feel like you're fiddling with a coin purse strapped to your leg. Othrewise, just as a pair of not-super-serious tech'y shorts with a loose silhouette you can't beat these. I think these are destined to be A+ Grailed bait for a while.\n\n\nCurious to hear what your impressions are! If you're thinking about buying don't hesitate. If you're bummed that only pink is available in your size just buy a couple bottles of Rit dye and you're good to go. Cotton takes dye easily and the other details are all black, so these are the perfect DIY dye project.\n\nEDIT: Something I just noticed. On Nike's PDP [there's a photo] (https://c.static-nike.com/a/images/t_PDP_1728_v1/f_auto/kalhudidrefzn5km4agq/nikelab-acg-deploy-men%E2%80%99s-cargo-shorts-4LgBMG.jpg) of the model putting his hands into pockets that seem built-in to the pouches. There are no pockets. You can put your hands there if you like, but there's no pocket there. Kinda misleading for Nike to post this.",

Instead he goes right past her and Rey is the one greeting Leia with grief in her eyes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut then I thought... *Chewie is pissed at Leia and, in the moment, blames her for Han's death!*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFrom Chewie's POV - He is sworn to protect Han for saving his life. He's got a Wookie oath to uphold. He saw Ben grow up and knew him when he turned. He also knows about everything he did and has fought the First Order *at least* in this film. I imagine Chewie is very disappointed in Ben and sees him as a lost cause and/or a bad egg. Or worse, a traitor to the family and unredeemable... Han went out on that catwalk in no small part because of Leia's encouragement. Chewie knows this. And now he's torn to pieces, not just because he lost his best friend, but because *he couldn't protect Han with it mattered most.* He was filled with Wookie rage and later on crushing guilt for letting Han down.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor that reason, we see him giving Leia the freeze-out when he returns and later on, we see him grieving alone in the corner.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOr JJ just wanted for Rey to have a huge moment with Leia because she could be her aunt and/or mother.
