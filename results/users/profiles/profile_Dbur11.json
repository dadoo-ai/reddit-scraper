    "body": "**Got Agentforce provisioned in an SDO and PDE org, updates below.**\n\nI've been trying for the last three weeks to get the required SKUs provisioned to a PDE so my consulting firm can build a proof of concept for agentforce demo's with no success.\n\nI'm getting put into a loop with partner support where they say they've provisioned the agentforce SKUs, but when I go to activate \"Einstein Setup\" from the setup UI, I'm not finding it, then I tell partner support and they route me to a new ticket because \"that person only handles provisioning SKUs, not troubleshooting\".\n\nI've been requesting the 4 SKUs outlined in the SFBen article with no luck from support. One support agent gave me documentation that instructed me to deploy the features and settings via CLI? Has anyone tried this successfully?\n\nHas anyone had success getting their hands on the functionality in their own dev org? I feel like Salesforce is still changing the SKUs required to actually get agentforce up and running...\n\nAny help is appreciated, for the record I'm not sold on agentforce being the next best thing, just trying to do my due diligence as a small consulting partner.\n\nSFBen article for reference: [https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-agentforce-is-generally-available-heres-how-to-get-started-today/](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-agentforce-is-generally-available-heres-how-to-get-started-today/)\n\nUpdate: these tickets were all with partner support not traditional SF support, edited original post.\n\nUpdate 2: Successfully provisioned agentforce to an SDO and PDE! \n\nThe SDO works well with demo'ing the Copilot type agent with a Salesforce sample data set. Of course, you aren't supposed to customize things in an SDO. You provision your own SDO from Partner Learning Camp portal.\n\nI also successfully got agentforce provisioned to a PDE after several attempts with partner support tickets. It seems the first 3 or 4 support agents simply proivisioned the wrong SKUs or didn't provision anything at all. For folks trying to get this provisioned to a PDE org today, I found this updated instruction, pasted below, from one of the agentforce quip documents that hopefully helps you get this up and running in your PDE faster then I could!  \nPasted instructions from Salesforce quip document:  \n\"Agentforce in Partner Developer, Partner Enterprise, and Trial Source Orgs:\n\nA case submission is required for enabling Agentforce in the above org types created from Environment Hub. Log a case (https://help.salesforce.com/s/case-selection) with the following instructions:\n\nFill Out Subject and Description\n\nSubject: Partner Programs &amp; Benefits\n\nDescription: Enable Einstein for Platform in ISV Orgs\n\n(Please wait up to 30 seconds for Product &amp; Topic pick list to populate) Select 'Partner Programs &amp; Benefits - Demo &amp; Partner Business Orgs' from pick list. If 'Partner Programs &amp; Benefits - Demo &amp; Partner Business Orgs' does not appear, select 'Pick a different product &amp; topic'\n\nAdd Org ID\n\nBody of the Case:\n\nSelect instance type: Production (even if not requesting for a Production org, this will help it route to the correct team)\n\nSelect Severity (1-4 levels)\n\nCollaborators: Include additional contacts (email) that should be notified of the specific request (internal and/or external)\n\nSelect ‘Create Case’\"\n\nBiggest takeaways for me: in both the SDO and PDE, you are gifted a pre-programmed copilot agent that you can add additional topics (and associated actions) to for very quick demo and PoC work inside of Salesforce. I ONLY have access to create Service Agent types, I'm not sure if there are additional permissions or SKUs needed to access the other types (Sales coach, SDR, etc.) or if those just aren't GA yet. I am also struggling to get access to the field generation or record summary prompts, i.e dropping a Record Summary component on a record page and giving users access to use the summarize details prompt. Again, not sure if this is a permissions or SKUs or GA issue yet.  \n  \nI'm happy to answer any questions I can, and very open to advice from others who may have had success with agent types other then copilot and service, and the field generation and record summary features.
