This strategy allows them to expand faster, generate more predictable revenue streams, and avoid the capital requirements and market risks of property ownership.\n\nAn interesting question emerges about whether these companies might be strategically positioning themselves for AI-driven disruptions to real estate and travel markets. While the asset-light transition began in the early 2000s (predating widespread corporate AI awareness), the positioning does look prescient given potential AI impacts like reduced business travel due to better remote collaboration, autonomous vehicles changing location preferences, and virtual experiences substituting for some physical travel.\n\nThe strategic wisdom appears to be that being a brand and technology platform is more defensible than owning fixed physical assets that might become less valuable as AI transforms how people work and travel. Whether this represents deliberate AI foresight or simply good financial instincts that happened to be future-proof is unclear, but the asset-light model certainly seems well-positioned for an AI-transformed hospitality landscape.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nI’ve been staying at Marriotts for decades and it feels like the experience has slowly been degrading. On the other hand, as my username should probably make clear I’m aging and getting cranky, so perhaps I’m just imagining things.\n\nIs it just me or do you think the Marriott experience has been going downhill?

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flight from Buffalo to Dulles will probably go to an A gate. Your flight to Frankfurt will be a C or D gate. Not terrible but a ~15 minutes transit. This means that if your first flight is on time and you go straight to the next gate you’ll get there about the time boarding starts. As other people have noted, Frankfurt is a crapshoot. I’ve gotten through Frankfurt in less than an hour and a couple times I’ve had it take between three and four hours. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "My grandfather was Scottish. I know it’s a stereotype, but let’s just say that he was careful with a dollar. He was six foot four (important later), supported his family by working by day as an inspector in a meat packing plant, ran a small farm with cattle, ran a plumbing supply operation, over a period of several decades built 30 houses by hand, one a year, and during the depression was an amateur prize fighter. By the late 1970s he had cancer several times and it had come back yet again. He decided that he was going to enjoy his last couple of years so he hopped in his pick up truck and drove from Ottawa Iowa to the only Mercedes dealership in Iowa at the time which was in Des Moines. Imagine, if you will, an elderly rangy looking farmer with a broken nose and cauliflower ears, wearing a flannel shirt and a set of coveralls walking into a Mercedes dealership. The sales people sent the new guy over to talk to him. He told the sales guy he wanted the 240D like the one they had on the showroom floor. When the sales guy asked him how he wanted to pay for it he said he would write a check. He went ahead and wrote the check and a couple minutes later the sales guy came back, looking surprised and said to him “your check is good!” My grandfather was a pretty collected guy, and I don’t think I ever saw him upset. The way he told the story, though, is that he stood up very slowly without breaking eye contact and asked the sales rep if he had any reason to think the check wouldn’t be good. He was pretty sure the sales rep had to go change his shorts. The dealership arranged to have somebody drive his truck home so he could drive his new Mercedes home, and I will say that they took very good care of him and his car for as long as he lasted.",

We would even leave the quote sheet with the measurements with the customer because we knew we had the best price for installed vertical blinds. We did not, however, have the best price if you were gonna measure yourself and then go have the blinds made somewhere else and then install them yourself. For those of you that don’t know the LA area, Orange County is where people with too much money live. I had a call to go down there and measure 22 windows and I realized while I was doing it that the husband and wife were following me around and trying to jot down the measurements so I deliberately shorted the height and width by a couple of inches on the remaining windows. A month later, my boss called me into his office because he had an angry customer on the phone and he couldn’t find the order form. While I was helping him look I realized it was the people in Orange County, and I immediately found the form in the quoted but not purchased file. They had actually called to try to get us to pay for the blinds that they had bought somewhere else because the blinds didn’t fit in their windows. My boss enjoyed telling them “no” and then offering to have someone come down and remeasure and sell them a full set of correct size blinds at full price.",

    "body": "I can’t answer the question about what undergrads are choosing as their major to remain relevant, but I can share some thoughts about what they should be choosing. In the late 1970s when I started college, the stars were the electrical engineers who built the hardware. Software majors were viewed as second class citizens who couldn’t build hardware. That remained true for most of the 1980s and it wasn’t really until the 1990s that software came into its own. I think the next shift will be from how to build software to what you want the software to do. While there will still be a handful of people writing code, most of the “automation” work in the future will be more business analysis flavored.",

A friend in the payroll department on the West Coast called him on a Friday afternoon and said that the whole East Coast office was going to be shut down over the weekend.

First thing Monday morning my friend went to his bank, moved all the money to a different account and closed the account at the bank where he’d had direct deposit set up. What a lot of people don’t know is that once you set up direct deposit your company can take money out as easily as they put money in. Monday morning his now ex-employer clawed back all of the East Coast bonuses except for his because he’d closed his account. His ex-employer spent the next six months trying to get him to ship his notebook computer back, and to give back that final bonus.",
