Could RC be saying that, in the previous quarterly reports we have 5mil ish shares DRS’d and all we had to do is match his 9m in order to lock the float. I mean 69 nice is about giving what am you get!\n\nI realise the maths doesn’t fully flesh out with what we know is outstanding but if we then tied in 741 and said that for every 1 share we DRS we effectively take 7 off the available count, and we multiple our 9m of DRS target by 7 that would give us 63m shares. Leaving a difference of 13m again rounding etc but that 13m could easily be taken up internally, by RC’s extra buy and a few other bits.\n\nI know it’s not likely but it would line the ducks all up in a nice row, part of me was lying here worried that if the number in the next quarterly report is low it may dishearten people and if it’s large it’s a huge spurn on, but if we do only need to get to 9m and the amount of DRS’ing done over the recent dip could get us pretty close!",

But in my role of never being happy I moved and started building some of these automations in python and they were quicker, cleaner, and a lot more fun to code. \n\nNow i'm at a point where I have a automation where employees can email a spreadsheet to a certain inbox where outlook will save it down to a specified folder and run a script. However this task can only be run once at a time due to it using some specific software. \n\nSo far I have a celery queue running on a rabbitmq message service on a windows server and when the inbox receives the email it saves the xlsx file down and then calls a python script and passes the filename as a parameter.\n\nThis seems to work 100% of the time, the email inbox will successfully receive the email, save down the file, and call the python script which sends and email to the sender to say task received but then the line after sending the email is:\n\n    r = startpost.apply_async(args=[sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3]])\n\nNow for some reason it almost seems like it takes two emails to queue a task, one will go through save and send a received email but then never make it to the queue the other will also receive save and then queue.\n\nConsidering I'm thinking this may be the only task that i'm using the queue for it feels like celery is almost a sledgehammer for a nail, but I can't seem to find any other solution to what I need it to do.\n\nDoes anyone have any solutions for what is going wrong with my current setup or suggestions for alternatives to achieve what i'm trying to do.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Guys,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if anyone had any experience or advice, the company I work for I have managed to move my role more into task automation of which I had taught myself VBA and it was pretty sufficient. But in my role of never being happy I moved and started building some of these automations in python and they were quicker, cleaner, and a lot more fun to code. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now i&amp;#39;m at a point where I have a automation where employees can email a spreadsheet to a certain inbox where outlook will save it down to a specified folder and run a script. However this task can only be run once at a time due to it using some specific software. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far I have a celery queue running on a rabbitmq message service on a windows server and when the inbox receives the email it saves the xlsx file down and then calls a python script and passes the filename as a parameter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to work 100% of the time, the email inbox will successfully receive the email, save down the file, and call the python script which sends and email to the sender to say task received but then the line after sending the email is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;r = startpost.apply_async(args=[sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3]])\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for some reason it almost seems like it takes two emails to queue a task, one will go through save and send a received email but then never make it to the queue the other will also receive save and then queue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering I&amp;#39;m thinking this may be the only task that i&amp;#39;m using the queue for it feels like celery is almost a sledgehammer for a nail, but I can&amp;#39;t seem to find any other solution to what I need it to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any solutions for what is going wrong with my current setup or suggestions for alternatives to achieve what i&amp;#39;m trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
