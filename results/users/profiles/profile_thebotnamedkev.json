You can make the math work so that it’s a null or only slight increase in costs but will provide long term savings \n2) you can extend your renewal term. If you are on a one year, consider a three year term and Salesforce may award you discounts. Remember, Salesforce recognizes revenue on future acv within the contract term. With this option they can recognize two more years of acv now. Sometimes reps are incentivized this. \n3) wouldn’t recommend it, but you can threaten a non renewal and move to another platform if they do not concede on pricing. This may sour things with Salesforce and have long term impact. \n\nJust know, the likelihood of you reducing licensing and getting any discount is next to none. You have to make it mutual. \n\nOption one is usually the best. Buy something now, negotiate your overall licensing spend, find ways for cost savings down the road. Your focus should be on getting discounts on the big hitters (like enterprise licenses) since you know you will likely need more in the future and those have the highest costs. \n\nHope this helps!",
