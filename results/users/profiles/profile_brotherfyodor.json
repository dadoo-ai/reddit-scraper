And now with their ninth trip in 10 years(?) puts the whole league is on the event horizon.. Is The NFL a collapsed star thats fallen in on itself? Because my burning question is, \n\nIs the game still competitive?  \n\nIDK Maybe it is but it doesn't feel like it. The football despair is real lol ",
