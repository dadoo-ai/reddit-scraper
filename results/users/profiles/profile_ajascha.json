    "communityName": "r/AI_Agents",
    "parsedCommunityName": "AI_Agents",
    "body": "Hey all! My team and I have been working with a couple of CRM-related topics (prioritization of tasks, actions, deals and meeting prep, follow up, etc.) and I wanted to share a few things we learned about lead prioritization.\n\n# Why bother?\n\nUnless you are running a company or working in sales or customer service, you might be wondering why prioritization matters. Most sales teams run many different opportunities or deals in parallel, all with different topics, stakeholders, conversations, objections, actions, and a lot more specifics attached. Put simply: Overwhelm -&gt; inefficient allocation of time -&gt; poor results.\n\nFor example: If each sales person is managing 20 open opportunities with 3 stakeholders you are already at 60 people who you could contact potentially (rather: start thinking about why to contact them but that's a different story). When planning the day, you want to be confident that you are placing your bets right.\n\nMost companies in the B2B space already have some form of lead or opportunity scoring. The problem is that they usually suck – they are prone to subjective bias, they do not consider important nuances, they lack \"big picture\" understanding, and – worst of all – they are static. This is not anyone's personal fault but a hard problem that most companies are struggling with and the consequences for individuals are real.\n\nHence, one of the most crucial questions in a B2B setting is \"who to contact next?\"\n\n# How we solve lead prioritization\n\nI'll start with the bad news: You can't just throw an LLM at a CRM and expect it to work wonders – we tried that many times. While a lot of information is inside the CRM indeed, the LLM needs context on 1) what to look for, 2) how to interpret information, and 3) what to do with it. This input context is not trivial. The system really needs to understand lots of details about the processes in order to build trust in the output.\n\nHere are a couple of things we found crucial in the process of building this:\n\n1. Combining CRM data with rich context: We analyze a wide range of data sources that are attached to the CRM system, including emails, conversation logs, strategy documents, and even industry trends. This allows us to build a comprehensive picture of each lead's potential and needs. The goal here is to have all relevant interaction data considered although that's not necessary to begin with.\n2. Campaigns: Most companies, especially those in earlier stages and with fast-changing offerings, are constantly updating their belief on their target market based on new evidence (as they should – check out Bayes theorem y'all!). As a consequence, the belief around \"who are our ideal customers?\" is constantly evolving and so must the context for sorting.\n3. Continuous updates: Unlike static lead scoring, the system should continuously recalculate priorities based on the latest interaction data as well as campaign beliefs (see previous point). Sales teams must always have up-to-date information on which leads are most promising – otherwise they will go back to digging through notes and emails themselves.\n4. Cost: LLM cost is going down continuously but what you are reading here gets expensive really fast. That's another reason why \"throw all data into the context\" simply isn't an option – especially if you intend to update your pipeline after crucial interactions.\n5. Working with \"internal signals\": Effectively, you are training the AI to spot obvious ones (Decision Maker said \"no\") while also looking for subtle signals that might indicate a lead is ready to convert, like changes in communication patterns or shifts in company strategy. This is not trivial to implement but if you give the model several examples to compare, you do pay some extra but get a pretty decent performance uplift out of the box.\n6. CRM = relationships = graphs: When analyzing a deal or lead, you can't just look at the object in isolation, otherwise you are losing crucial context. You need to combine related objects even if they are not explicitly mapped, like Tarzan from one liana to the next. We are doing that with NetworkX, a graph library for Python. This also brings deduplication into play but that can be fixed separately.\n7. CRM System = database: In a way, the above treats Salesforce and Hubspot like databases. We do have a UI for a couple of operations but with 100+ CRM systems out there there is really no point in building another one. And there is also no need to: For prioritization, the output can be as simple as a list of IDs and a score which can be synced back with the CRM.\n8. Operations needs != managerial needs: This might seem obvious but the beauty of agentic workflows is that you can process actual *work*. That means you can work your way up from exact processes on the ground level and get increasingly complex. But it's important to note that this is *potential work* being done and unless you provide management with the necessary insights to make structural changes, no change will be implemented.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nI won't be posting numbers here but it's fair to say that the results we're seeing are pretty exciting across the board. The teams we are working with are reporting significantly higher conversion rates and shorter sales cycles.\n\nAside from the pure number work, these are some of the ingredients that are causing these effects:\n\n* Contact the right leads first: If you have a reliable ranking you are increasing your chances of hitting more that will ultimately say yes and build momentum. Conversely, in the \"naive\" case you risk contacting them last or never if the list is too long. That is particularly bad since sales (and customer success / service alike!) is largely based on confidence in your product, your pitch, your leads.\n* ... and as a consequence, they don't need to contact as many to get the same outcome: Imagine you have a list of 100 leads but only 20 of them are likely to convert. Why bother with the other 80 if you have a full pipeline already?\n* The teams are spending a lot less time on administrative tasks and more time building relationships with high-potential leads.\n* ... and hence, they can now place your bets a lot more consciously and spend time preparing effectively.\n\n# Final considerations\n\nThe teams we are doing this with have 30k-100k contacts and millions of interactions associated with those but the principle works on much smaller lists already (case in point: ours ;-))\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that while prioritzation alone has some benefits, it is particularly powerful if combined with proper reasoning and summarization.\n\nThere is a reason why the big CRM players haven't cracked this despite unlimited access to enterprise support at all the major AI players for 2 years. We also had to learn this the hard way and in case you are trying to rebuild this, expect to spend a surprising amount of time thinking about UX rather than fiddling with your beloved agents. They are crucial but not everything.\n\nSpeaking of agents, our stack is quite simple: Gemini Flash 2.0 and Pro 2.5, Big Query, and Python. You could probably build this with n8n and Google Sheets too but since the data handling is high dimensional things get messy really fast.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter. Has anyone else experimented with similar AI-driven lead prioritization? What challenges have you faced?",

Sales teams must always have up-to-date information on which leads are most promising – otherwise they will go back to digging through notes and emails themselves.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cost: LLM cost is going down continuously but what you are reading here gets expensive really fast. That&amp;#39;s another reason why &amp;quot;throw all data into the context&amp;quot; simply isn&amp;#39;t an option – especially if you intend to update your pipeline after crucial interactions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with &amp;quot;internal signals&amp;quot;: Effectively, you are training the AI to spot obvious ones (Decision Maker said &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) while also looking for subtle signals that might indicate a lead is ready to convert, like changes in communication patterns or shifts in company strategy. This is not trivial to implement but if you give the model several examples to compare, you do pay some extra but get a pretty decent performance uplift out of the box.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CRM = relationships = graphs: When analyzing a deal or lead, you can&amp;#39;t just look at the object in isolation, otherwise you are losing crucial context. You need to combine related objects even if they are not explicitly mapped, like Tarzan from one liana to the next. We are doing that with NetworkX, a graph library for Python. This also brings deduplication into play but that can be fixed separately.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CRM System = database: In a way, the above treats Salesforce and Hubspot like databases. We do have a UI for a couple of operations but with 100+ CRM systems out there there is really no point in building another one. And there is also no need to: For prioritization, the output can be as simple as a list of IDs and a score which can be synced back with the CRM.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operations needs != managerial needs: This might seem obvious but the beauty of agentic workflows is that you can process actual &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;. That means you can work your way up from exact processes on the ground level and get increasingly complex. But it&amp;#39;s important to note that this is &lt;em&gt;potential work&lt;/em&gt; being done and unless you provide management with the necessary insights to make structural changes, no change will be implemented.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t be posting numbers here but it&amp;#39;s fair to say that the results we&amp;#39;re seeing are pretty exciting across the board. The teams we are working with are reporting significantly higher conversion rates and shorter sales cycles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from the pure number work, these are some of the ingredients that are causing these effects:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contact the right leads first: If you have a reliable ranking you are increasing your chances of hitting more that will ultimately say yes and build momentum. Conversely, in the &amp;quot;naive&amp;quot; case you risk contacting them last or never if the list is too long. That is particularly bad since sales (and customer success / service alike!) is largely based on confidence in your product, your pitch, your leads.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;... and as a consequence, they don&amp;#39;t need to contact as many to get the same outcome: Imagine you have a list of 100 leads but only 20 of them are likely to convert. Why bother with the other 80 if you have a full pipeline already?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The teams are spending a lot less time on administrative tasks and more time building relationships with high-potential leads.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;... and hence, they can now place your bets a lot more consciously and spend time preparing effectively.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Final considerations&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The teams we are doing this with have 30k-100k contacts and millions of interactions associated with those but the principle works on much smaller lists already (case in point: ours ;-))&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also worth pointing out that while prioritzation alone has some benefits, it is particularly powerful if combined with proper reasoning and summarization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a reason why the big CRM players haven&amp;#39;t cracked this despite unlimited access to enterprise support at all the major AI players for 2 years. We also had to learn this the hard way and in case you are trying to rebuild this, expect to spend a surprising amount of time thinking about UX rather than fiddling with your beloved agents. They are crucial but not everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of agents, our stack is quite simple: Gemini Flash 2.0 and Pro 2.5, Big Query, and Python. You could probably build this with n8n and Google Sheets too but since the data handling is high dimensional things get messy really fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this matter. Has anyone else experimented with similar AI-driven lead prioritization? What challenges have you faced?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "*TL;DR – Sales reps wasted 3 mins/call figuring out who they’re talking to. We killed manual CRM work with AI + Slack. Demo bookings up 18%.*\n\n# The Problem\n\nA fintech sales team scaled to $1M ARR fast… then hit a wall. Their 5 reps were stuck in two nightmares:\n\n**Nightmare 1: Pre-call chaos.** 3+ minutes wasted per call digging through Salesforce notes and emails to answer:\n\n* *“Who is this? Did someone already talk to them? What did we even say last time? What information are we lacking to see if they are even a fit for our latest product?”*\n* Worse for recycled leads: *“Why does this contact have 4 conflicting notes from different reps?\"*\n\nWorst of all: 30% of “qualified” leads were disqualified after reviewing CRM infos, but prep time was already burned.\n\n**Nightmare 2: CRM busywork.** Post-call, reps spent 2-3 minutes logging notes and updating fields manually. What's worse is the psychological effect: Frequent process changes taught reps knew that some information collected now might never be relevant again.\n\n**Result:** Reps spent **8+ hours/week** on admin, not selling. Growth stalled and hiring more reps would only make matters worse.\n\n# The Fix\n\nWe built an AI agent that:\n\n**1. Automates pre-call prep:**\n\n* Scans all historical call transcripts, emails, and CRM data for the lead.\n* Generates a **one-slap summary** before each call: *“Last interaction: 4/12 – Spoke to CFO Linda (not the receptionist!). Discussed billing pain points. Unresolved: Send API docs. List of follow-up questions: ...”* \n\n**2. Auto-updates Salesforce post-call:**\n\n# How We Did It\n\n1. **Shadowed reps for one week** aka watched them toggle between tabs to prep for calls.\n2. **Analyzed 10,000+ call transcripts:** One success pattern we found: Reps who asked *“How’s \\[specific workflow\\] actually working?”* early kept leads engaged; prospects love talking about problems.\n3. **Slack-first design:** All CRM edits happen in Slack. No more Salesforce alt-tabbing.\n\n# Results\n\n* **2.5 minutes saved per call** (no more “Who are you?” awkwardness).\n* **40% higher call rate per rep:** Time savings led to much better utilization and prep notes help gain confidence to have the \"right\" conversation.\n* **18% more demos booked** in 2 months.\n* **Eliminated manual CRM updates:** All post-call logging is automated (except Slack corrections).\n\n**Rep feedback:** *“I gained so much confidence going into calls. I have all relevant information and can trust on asking questions. I still take notes but just to steer the conversation; the CRM is updated for me.”*\n\n# What’s Next\n\nWith these wins in the bag, we are now turning to a few more topics that we came up along the process:\n\n1. **Smart prioritization:** Sort leads by how likely they respond to specific product based on all the information we have on them.\n2. **Auto-task lists:** Post-call, the bot DMs reps: *“Reminder: Send CFO API docs by Friday.”*\n3. **Disqualify leads faster:** Auto-flag prospects who ghost &gt;2 times.\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat’s your team’s most time-sucking CRM task?",

You can definitely do that and I'd recommend that you pick one system (e.g. Pipedrive) to be your central data store for all the other platforms – that's how we are doing it at our company and it's working very well.

I view them as the new \"Hi {firstname}\" which itself is an upgrade to the Prince from Nigeria (and both these models seem to be making business still!)\n\nThe biggest benefit I see in AI for sales is in letting it dig through the masses of CRM data (structured from properties but also notes, emails, transcripts, etc.) and return information to users in the format they need, whether that's a summary of all interactions with a prospect, analyzing stakeholder engagement, prioritizing next actions, or even generating a follow-up message.\n\nThese are all possible nowadays but the final decision on what action to pursue should come from the person in charge. Especially in B2B trust between people is paramount and the moment someone finds out they were lured in by an AI, they will feel treated like a \"target\" much rather than a human and trust drops. Conversely, being well-prepared for a meeting and asking the right questions typically raises it.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI SDRs have their place, but I agree with you that their promise is far more limited than advertised. I view them as the new &amp;quot;Hi {firstname}&amp;quot; which itself is an upgrade to the Prince from Nigeria (and both these models seem to be making business still!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit I see in AI for sales is in letting it dig through the masses of CRM data (structured from properties but also notes, emails, transcripts, etc.) and return information to users in the format they need, whether that&amp;#39;s a summary of all interactions with a prospect, analyzing stakeholder engagement, prioritizing next actions, or even generating a follow-up message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all possible nowadays but the final decision on what action to pursue should come from the person in charge. Especially in B2B trust between people is paramount and the moment someone finds out they were lured in by an AI, they will feel treated like a &amp;quot;target&amp;quot; much rather than a human and trust drops. Conversely, being well-prepared for a meeting and asking the right questions typically raises it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But truth be told, the market is always bad and you will need to find the starving crowd that can&amp;#39;t keep up with their needs. They exist, you need to find them and decide if their mission is worth for you to spend a chunk of your life. Case in point: We are hiring, a couple of my founder friends are hiring, and all of us are seeing plenty of bad applications each day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, don&amp;#39;t fall for the &amp;quot;experience trap&amp;quot;: We just hired a 17-year old, his dad visited us to sign the contract. He did have skills in the required area but far from we typically look for. But he had drive well above average so we knew that all we knew was put fuel in the tank and let him grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "Hey folks!\n\nLately I have been thinking a lot about doing a podcast about intelligent automation. I am just amazed how little content gets pushed out there given that it has become a big topic for companies and will become even bigger in the future.\n\nI am actually on a good track with regards to planning things and setup but I wanted to get feedback on the idea from a few people, opinions on contents/focus of the show and maybe also some people you would want to hear on these things.\n\nMy plan is to focus on two broader topics:\n\n1. What people have accomplished with no code tools (Zapier and friends) – just looking at what we have built at our company lately with these tools made me a die-hard fan and I think people should know what is possible.\n2. What is commonly known as intelligent automation – stuff that goes beyond if/then, i.e. machine learning. There is so much going on in this space these days and I think that this will really shake things around in the RPA/Robotic Process Automation space.\n\nIn addition to that, we could explore applications like marketing automation and so on but I guess those are less relevant for non-marketing people.\n\nThe format should be mostly conversations with practitioners and people working at these automation companies and possibly a few solo sessions in between where it makes sense.\n\nI have actually never done something like this before and I think this could get the format off to a great start!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** I have set up a website [here](https://automation-masters.com/). All signups will be notified once the first episode goes live!",
