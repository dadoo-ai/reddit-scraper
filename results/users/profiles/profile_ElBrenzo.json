I'll likely end up getting the 5-year MyQ subscription or $179, which is about half of what installing Homelink would cost me, plus it has the added benefit of the smart app that I can share with my wife and others.\n\nMost importantly, MyQ is **SIGNIFICANTLY** better than Homelink. \n\nFor starters, it actually knows the status of your garage door, so it won't just assume it's always closed and start the opener motor as you drive up. I can't even count the number of times I almost accidentally closed the garage door on my wife's open tailgate or my kids as they were running in and out. Eventually I had to just set it to not open until I was &lt;40 feet away so I had the time to visually confirm the status of my garage door, which meant I couldn't just seamlessly pull into the garage.\n\nEqually as frustrating, Homelink may have only detected my departure 2% of the time to initiate the autoclose. For arrivals home, it was nearly flawless, but it just could not accurately determine when I was leaving the house. Unless I parked in my driveway, which perhaps increased it to a 20% detection rate, I was having to manually tap the screen to close every time I left - no matter what time of day or what direction I pulled out of the garage.

I don't plan on upgrading to FSD because 90% of my commute is on highways and it's not worth the extra money, to me.\n\nI am aware of the feature differences between EAP and AP, and the only one I would maybe miss is the auto lane change. However, I only use that maybe once or twice per day as a lot of my work commute varies between stop-and-go traffic or wide open traffic where I can cruise in one lane.\n\nI'll be giving up a car with sensors for a camera-based system, so my first question is if I'll notice any difference in how AP and the traffic-aware cruise control works. Yes, I know HW 4 is significantly better than what I have, but for me the smoothness in traffic especially in stop-and-go is most important to make my long commute tolerable. Aside from a couple miles on surface streets, I have EAP engaged for the majority of my highway time and it's been great.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n**UPDATE**: After experiencing FSD on a demo drive, I decided to take advantage of the hardware and software upgrade to FSD on my outgoing Model 3 to transfer over to the Model Y that I take delivery of this weekend - [full details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelY/comments/1lg3845/comment/mzlt5mh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).",

The wind and road noises are still there in an ICE vehicle with comparable seals and aerodynamics, but I always feel like they are less noticeable. \n\nIn my wife's '23 Tahoe you almost don't realize you're going 80 mph because of how smooth the ride is.

    "body": "On your first shot, your alignment seemed better than your second shot (more on that below), but it was definitely a bit chunky, and the face was too closed at address, which got even more closed prior to impact due to how far behind the ball you first come in contact with the sand. I'd also suggest trying to shorten up the swing, as it looks like your lead arm/shoulder caused your head to come back and off the ball, which likely contributed to hitting as far behind the ball as you did. If I had to guess, having more distance to cover in the bunker likely led to you overswinging for power, but I think you should instead be thinking about accelerating through with a slightly shorter swing and a more open club face. It's hard to say for sure, but it appears that your swing speed stays the same on the downswing, maybe even decelerates a little bit, which is an absolute killer in the bunkers. You don't want to swing out of control, but accelerating ever so slightly on the downswing and through impact will help you cut through the sand. While your initial finish position looks the same between both shots, your arms quickly retract on the first shot. While this is partially due to how much sand you just went through, it also suggests to me that you were likely decelerating,\n\nYour 2nd swing seemed much better. Unfortunately, you were aiming a solid 10 feet to the left. While you got a good trajectory out of the bunker, opening up the face at address (before gripping the club) would have at least helped it go a little more to the right, but you were still on a target line way too far to the left. Your swing was shorter - see picture and how far past parallel you were on 1st shot vs. 2nd - and you appeared to have finished with your hands higher, which I think is a big reason for the much better shot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1kd81kia77kf1.jpeg?width=529&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42efda04745283f9e5a3f69dafadc356c5f513dc",

    "body": "This time of year, I regularly have to pump water out from a low spot in my backyard. About a year ago, we dug a dry well that has helped collect most of the water underground, but there was no easy (cheap) way to connect this city storm drain in the front yard. To help drain, I've placed a 1-hp pump into the dry well that ejects water via a 2-inch flex tube that eventually connects to a 2-inch flat discharge/backwash hose, which I run along the side of my yard to the front. \n\nAt the front yard, I've got about 50' of the 2\" hose piled up, and when it's time to pump, I drag it across my front yard to the driveway so I can discharge to the city storm drain in the street. This is the only option that wouldn't discharge onto my front lawn, my neighbor's lawn, or require me to run the hose across the sidewalk to reach the street, which is a liability concern.\n\nThis spring, I plan to replace the 2\" flat discharge hose for most of the run along the side of my yard with something more permanent, like PVC that I'll insulate and partially bury in the ground. Not only would it be less sightly, but I'd be able to keep it outside all winter and not have to deal with the hose cracking or getting holes from animals and freezing water left in the hose. I usually run it a few times during the winter when we get freezing rain vs. snow, and it's flat in spots so gravity doesn't bring all the water back to the dry well or out to the front.\n\nMy initial thought was to have the PVC pop back up when it reaches the front yard and then connect the discharge hose via some coupling. Today, the 2\" discharge hose lies in a pile because it's a pain to re-roll the \\~50' of slack I need to reach my driveway. As a result, the hose sits in a pile, destroying my grass and generally does not look great. It's a muddy mess and not fun when temps are near freezing.\n\nI've found some larger reels for storing unused discharge hoses, but those are designed for 150' or more and you can't use the hose while it's attached since it expands when pumped with water. I thought I could find a smaller reel, but I haven't seen any wide enough to accommodate a 2\" hose. I'd have just enough hose to make the run from the side yard gate, across my lawn to the driveway and just need one end to have the coupling to connect to the PVC when it's time to pump. When done pumping, I'd disconnect from the PVC and reel it back up.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has come up with a solution for something similar. Or perhaps there is something I'm overlooking?",

    "body": "This time of year, I regularly have to pump water out from a low spot in my backyard. About a year ago, we dug a dry well that has helped collect most of the water underground, but there was no easy (cheap) way to connect this city storm drain in the front yard. To help drain, I've placed a 1-hp pump into the dry well that ejects water via a 2-inch flex tube that eventually connects to a 2-inch flat discharge/backwash hose, which I run along the side of my yard to the front. \n\nAt the front yard, I've got about 50' of the 2\" hose piled up, and when it's time to pump, I drag it across my front yard to the driveway so I can discharge to the city storm drain in the street. This is the only option that wouldn't discharge onto my front lawn, my neighbor's lawn, or require me to run the hose across the sidewalk to reach the street, which is a liability concern.\n\nThis spring, I plan to replace the 2\" flat discharge hose for most of the run along the side of my yard with something more permanent, like PVC that I'll insulate and partially bury in the ground. Not only would it be less sightly, but I'd be able to keep it outside all winter and not have to deal with the hose cracking or getting holes from animals and freezing water left in the hose. I usually run it a few times during the winter when we get freezing rain vs. snow, and it's flat in spots so gravity doesn't bring all the water back to the dry well or out to the front.\n\nMy initial thought was to have the PVC pop back up when it reaches the front yard and then connect the discharge hose via some coupling. Today, the 2\" discharge hose lies in a pile because it's a pain to re-roll the \\~50' of slack I need to reach my driveway. As a result, the hose sits in a pile, destroying my grass and generally does not look great. It's a muddy mess and not fun when temps are near freezing.\n\nI've found some larger reels for storing unused discharge hoses, but those are designed for 150' or more and you can't use the hose while it's attached since it expands when pumped with water. I thought I could find a smaller reel, but I haven't seen any wide enough to accommodate a 2\" hose. I'd have just enough hose to make the run from the side yard gate, across my lawn to the driveway and just need one end to have the coupling to connect to the PVC when it's time to pump. When done pumping, I'd disconnect from the PVC and reel it back up.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has come up with a solution for something similar. Or perhaps there is something I'm overlooking?",

As a result, the hose sits in a pile, destroying my grass and generally does not look great. It&amp;#39;s a muddy mess and not fun when temps are near freezing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found some larger reels for storing unused discharge hoses, but those are designed for 150&amp;#39; or more and you can&amp;#39;t use the hose while it&amp;#39;s attached since it expands when pumped with water. I thought I could find a smaller reel, but I haven&amp;#39;t seen any wide enough to accommodate a 2&amp;quot; hose. I&amp;#39;d have just enough hose to make the run from the side yard gate, across my lawn to the driveway and just need one end to have the coupling to connect to the PVC when it&amp;#39;s time to pump. When done pumping, I&amp;#39;d disconnect from the PVC and reel it back up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone has come up with a solution for something similar.

About a year ago, we dug a dry well that has helped collect most of the water underground, but there was no easy (cheap) way to connect this city storm drain in the front yard. To help drain, I've placed a 1-hp pump into the dry well that ejects water via a 2-inch flex tube that eventually connects to a 2-inch flat discharge/backwash hose, which I run along the side of my yard to the front. \n\nAt the front yard, I've got about 50' of the 2\" hose piled up, and when it's time to pump, I drag it across my front yard to the driveway so I can discharge to the city storm drain in the street. This is the only option that wouldn't discharge onto my front lawn, my neighbor's lawn, or require me to run the hose across the sidewalk to reach the street, which is a liability concern.\n\nThis spring, I plan to replace the 2\" flat discharge hose for most of the run along the side of my yard with something more permanent, like PVC that I'll insulate and partially bury in the ground. Not only would it be less sightly, but I'd be able to keep it outside all winter and not have to deal with the hose cracking or getting holes from animals and freezing water left in the hose. I usually run it a few times during the winter when we get freezing rain vs. snow, and it's flat in spots so gravity doesn't bring all the water back to the dry well or out to the front.\n\nMy initial thought was to have the PVC pop back up when it reaches the front yard and then connect the discharge hose via some coupling. Today, the 2\" discharge hose lies in a pile because it's a pain to re-roll the \\~50' of slack I need to reach my driveway. As a result, the hose sits in a pile, destroying my grass and generally does not look great. It's a muddy mess and not fun when temps are near freezing.\n\nI've found some larger reels for storing unused discharge hoses, but those are designed for 150' or more and you can't use the hose while it's attached since it expands when pumped with water. I thought I could find a smaller reel, but I haven't seen any wide enough to accommodate a 2\" hose. I'd have just enough hose to make the run from the side yard gate, across my lawn to the driveway and just need one end to have the coupling to connect to the PVC when it's time to pump. When done pumping, I'd disconnect from the PVC and reel it back up.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has come up with a solution for something similar. Or perhaps there is something I'm overlooking?",

So, there is almost 2.25\" of cushion on top of the concrete floor.\n\nMy concern is hitting off this putting turf and wearing it down.

About a year ago, we dug a dry well that has helped collect most of the water underground, but there was no easy (cheap) way to connect this city storm drain in the front yard. To help drain, I've placed a 1-hp pump into the dry well that ejects water via a 2-inch flex tube that eventually connects to a 2-inch flat discharge/backwash hose, which I run along the side of my yard to the front. \n\nAt the front yard, I've got about 50' of the 2\" hose piled up, and when it's time to pump, I drag it across my front yard to the driveway so I can discharge to the city storm drain in the street. This is the only option that wouldn't discharge onto my front lawn, my neighbor's lawn, or require me to run the hose across the sidewalk to reach the street, which is a liability concern.\n\nThis spring, I plan to replace the 2\" flat discharge hose for most of the run along the side of my yard with something more permanent, like PVC that I'll insulate and partially bury in the ground. Not only would it be less sightly, but I'd be able to keep it outside all winter and not have to deal with the hose cracking or getting holes from animals and freezing water left in the hose. I usually run it a few times during the winter when we get freezing rain vs. snow, and it's flat in spots so gravity doesn't bring all the water back to the dry well or out to the front.\n\nMy initial thought was to have the PVC pop back up when it reaches the front yard and then connect the discharge hose via some coupling. Today, the 2\" discharge hose lies in a pile because it's a pain to re-roll the \\~50' of slack I need to reach my driveway. As a result, the hose sits in a pile, destroying my grass and generally does not look great. It's a muddy mess and not fun when temps are near freezing.\n\nI've found some larger reels for storing unused discharge hoses, but those are designed for 150' or more and you can't use the hose while it's attached since it expands when pumped with water. I thought I could find a smaller reel, but I haven't seen any wide enough to accommodate a 2\" hose. I'd have just enough hose to make the run from the side yard gate, across my lawn to the driveway and just need one end to have the coupling to connect to the PVC when it's time to pump. When done pumping, I'd disconnect from the PVC and reel it back up.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has come up with a solution for something similar. Or perhaps there is something I'm overlooking?",

I know I can go into the individual app notification settings in System Settings and toggle off sound alerts, but I only want that to be the case when Focus DND is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Appreciate any help or insight anyone cna share.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

About a year ago, we dug a dry well that has helped collect most of the water underground, but there was no easy (cheap) way to connect this city storm drain in the front yard. To help drain, I've placed a 1-hp pump into the dry well that ejects water via a 2-inch flex tube that eventually connects to a 2-inch flat discharge/backwash hose, which I run along the side of my yard to the front. \n\nAt the front yard, I've got about 50' of the 2\" hose piled up, and when it's time to pump, I drag it across my front yard to the driveway so I can discharge to the city storm drain in the street. This is the only option that wouldn't discharge onto my front lawn, my neighbor's lawn, or require me to run the hose across the sidewalk to reach the street, which is a liability concern.\n\nThis spring, I plan to replace the 2\" flat discharge hose for most of the run along the side of my yard with something more permanent, like PVC that I'll insulate and partially bury in the ground. Not only would it be less sightly, but I'd be able to keep it outside all winter and not have to deal with the hose cracking or getting holes from animals and freezing water left in the hose. I usually run it a few times during the winter when we get freezing rain vs. snow, and it's flat in spots so gravity doesn't bring all the water back to the dry well or out to the front.\n\nMy initial thought was to have the PVC pop back up when it reaches the front yard and then connect the discharge hose via some coupling. Today, the 2\" discharge hose lies in a pile because it's a pain to re-roll the \\~50' of slack I need to reach my driveway. As a result, the hose sits in a pile, destroying my grass and generally does not look great. It's a muddy mess and not fun when temps are near freezing.\n\nI've found some larger reels for storing unused discharge hoses, but those are designed for 150' or more and you can't use the hose while it's attached since it expands when pumped with water. I thought I could find a smaller reel, but I haven't seen any wide enough to accommodate a 2\" hose. I'd have just enough hose to make the run from the side yard gate, across my lawn to the driveway and just need one end to have the coupling to connect to the PVC when it's time to pump. When done pumping, I'd disconnect from the PVC and reel it back up.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has come up with a solution for something similar. Or perhaps there is something I'm overlooking?",

    "body": "This time of year, I regularly have to pump water out from a low spot in my backyard. About a year ago, we dug a dry well that has helped collect most of the water underground, but there was no easy (cheap) way to connect this city storm drain in the front yard. To help drain, I've placed a 1-hp pump into the dry well that ejects water via a 2-inch flex tube that eventually connects to a 2-inch flat discharge/backwash hose, which I run along the side of my yard to the front. \n\nAt the front yard, I've got about 50' of the 2\" hose piled up, and when it's time to pump, I drag it across my front yard to the driveway so I can discharge to the city storm drain in the street. This is the only option that wouldn't discharge onto my front lawn, my neighbor's lawn, or require me to run the hose across the sidewalk to reach the street, which is a liability concern.\n\nThis spring, I plan to replace the 2\" flat discharge hose for most of the run along the side of my yard with something more permanent, like PVC that I'll insulate and partially bury in the ground. Not only would it be less sightly, but I'd be able to keep it outside all winter and not have to deal with the hose cracking or getting holes from animals and freezing water left in the hose. I usually run it a few times during the winter when we get freezing rain vs. snow, and it's flat in spots so gravity doesn't bring all the water back to the dry well or out to the front.\n\nMy initial thought was to have the PVC pop back up when it reaches the front yard and then connect the discharge hose via some coupling. Today, the 2\" discharge hose lies in a pile because it's a pain to re-roll the \\~50' of slack I need to reach my driveway. As a result, the hose sits in a pile, destroying my grass and generally does not look great. It's a muddy mess and not fun when temps are near freezing.\n\nI've found some larger reels for storing unused discharge hoses, but those are designed for 150' or more and you can't use the hose while it's attached since it expands when pumped with water. I thought I could find a smaller reel, but I haven't seen any wide enough to accommodate a 2\" hose. I'd have just enough hose to make the run from the side yard gate, across my lawn to the driveway and just need one end to have the coupling to connect to the PVC when it's time to pump. When done pumping, I'd disconnect from the PVC and reel it back up.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has come up with a solution for something similar. Or perhaps there is something I'm overlooking?",
