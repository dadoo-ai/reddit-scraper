I figure I never did get that last lash I needed.  I jokingly gear up, fully expecting her to spread my ashes across the wildspire waste, except she doesn't.  Not only am I kicking her ass with Savage Jho up mine the entire time, I somehow manage to cut off her tail.  I carve the tail and I get...a shard.  At this point I'm frustrated but still fighting her and hoping I get the lash from a bonus drop, nope.  Instead of elation at coming back to find I'm still worthy I'm tilted off the earth and turn off my PlayStation.  I fucking hate RNG.  If I cut off a fucking tail I should get a fucking tail.  How hard is that?!",

So I decide to fight MR Lunastra.  I figure I never did get that last lash I needed.  I jokingly gear up, fully expecting her to spread my ashes across the wildspire waste, except she doesn&amp;#39;t.  Not only am I kicking her ass with Savage Jho up mine the entire time, I somehow manage to cut off her tail.  I carve the tail and I get...a shard.  At this point I&amp;#39;m frustrated but still fighting her and hoping I get the lash from a bonus drop, nope.

flickers multiple times and there is a single underscore in the top left corner while it's doing that.\n* Crackling audio out of the HDMI audio on the graphics card.\n* PC crashes or BSOD when I try to run any 3D benchmark (Furmark/Heaven/3DMark) \n   * \"VIDEO\\_SCHEDULER\\_INTERNAL\\_ERROR\"\n* GPU sometimes not recognized by windows (shows up as default adapter)\n\nThese are the components I'm using (Used a 3100 CPU to flash new BIOS, issues have been present with both)\n\nAlready changed the PCI express slot to 3.0 for the riser cable, fixed nothing.\n\n\\[PCPartPicker Part
