    "body": "Hello fellow people.\n\nI've stumbled upon a problem, which I cannot solve despite days of research and plenty of frustration and complaints from family members for broken internet.\n\n\nI have a home server running quite a few things e.g. email, Nextcloud, couple of web pages. It also hosts several web apps, including Omada controller and CCTV via Blue Iris. \n\nMost of it is hosted either directly on the server or it's VMs. The routing is done via Apache vHosts.\n\nThe server has a public domain e.g. wazzaap.com. Dynamic DNS is handled using freedns.afraid.org. \n\nNow what I wanted to do is to keep the current setup, BUT have domain and subdomains routable though the internal network without going to the internet. Reason? For things like CCTV and Omada controller, I don't want to have their UIs exposed to the web, but I want to have easy domain names e.g. wazzaap.com/cctv or omada.wazzaap.com.\n\nAfter reading a bit, I figured that local DNS would be a decent solution, as TP-Links Omada does not provide local DNS (shame on them). \n\nSo I configured my main home server (Windows Server 2019, please don't judge) to run DNS server as well. I pointed the domain wazzaap.com to server's local IP (192.168.0.5). Added DNS server in Omada (router) settings.\n\n\nNSlookup and traceroute showed that it worked perfectly. Instead of my external IP it was now showing 192.168.0.5. Problem is: I can no longer reach any site on the domain from inside the network. From the outside it works perfectly well.\n\n\nAfter couple of tweaks and few attempts I gave up. Figured I'll make a separate VM and put PiHole there and configure local DNS there. Result? Exactly the same. All works from the outside, nothing on the inside.\n\nI must be doing something very wrong fundamentally as for two different solutions I'm getting exactly the same result. But what?\n\nAny ideas or recommendations are very welcome, I'm losing sanity over it :)",

    "body": "So here's my story of doing Relex SMILE. I decided to post it here, because it's this sub that I have been reading most before and after the operation. The /r/lasik seems to be quite heavily moderated.\n\nI'm 36M and have been wearing glasses since second grade. By the time of the operation my vision has stabilized around -5,5 / -4,75. I've been ok with glasses for the most of my life and when they were not practical, I was using contact lens. However, despite that I was eyeing laser surgery for a very long time - over 15 years. But when I was young there were no money and later on I was anyway somewhat afraid. I've hardly ever been to the doctor throughout my adult life and you know - if it ain't terribly broke - don't fix it.\n\nSo yes, I was scared about the fact that something would be done to my eye and something would go wrong. However, I did have a lot of examples where lasik went fine. My wife - 14 years post operation. About a dozen colleagues who did it in the last 5-6 years. No one was complaining.\n\nSo still I was contemplating the correction, since it would make my life a bit easier as in some activities glasses were a nuisance and I didn't want to use contact lenses that often. About a year ago I learned about Relex SMILE and the fact that it was the least intrusive of all Lasik like corrections. I was intrigued and started researching. Read ton of articles, reviews and this sub as well.\n\nOf course marketing was painting rainbows and unicorns. This sub plus some other forums gave a whole lot of different perspective. The complications when they came were nasty and could kill quality of life completely. I understood that what I'm reading here is still likely to be minority cases. Negative feedback is always more prominent and vocal over positive. We are more likely to leave a bad review over a product or service than give praise. Especially when it comes to our own health.\n\nSo I went to a eye check to determine what are my options. I decided that if SMILE would not suit me, I will not do Lasik or other correction types. Getting my cornea cut by blade was too much for my tastes. The check up showed that despite my cornea being a bit thinner than average, SMILE was still possible.\n\nThe contract with eye clinic clearly said that they offer two years of \"warranty' period on operation, however they took no responsibility on possible complications or damages. Pretty standard I guess.\n\nSo then it was up to me again to weigh all the pro's and cons and decide whether I am willing to take the risk, acknowledging that if things go south I would be suffering for the rest of my life. Stories here we're different, aplenty and overall gave good picture on what to expect in worst cases.\n\nAfter some contemplation I decided to take the risk. The doctor who would do the operation said that I can get back to work two days after the surgery. I was not convinced, so I took three weeks of PTO just to make sure I have sufficient time to recover. Man, this was a good idea.\n\nI won't go into details of operation - everything was quick and painless. Up until the point when the anesthetic drops wore off and then I got the full set of 'foreign body' and sand in the eyes feeling. Thankfully I was fully stocked on the eyedrops. Immediately post-operation I could see stuff. It was somewhat manageable close by, and all quite blurry in the distance. But better than what I had without glasses previously. \n\nOn the second day - when I was supposed to be ready to return back to work - that would not have worked by any kind of margin. \n\n- White text on the dark background was glowing like sun with heavy glare. \n- Car lights were surrounded by halos. \n- Traffic lights were duplicating or even triplicating.\n- Quite bad vision at night\n- Eyes were extremely dry. I had to use the drops every 30-40 minutes just to keep them open.\n- Did I mention glare? Glare everywhere.\n\nOn a positive side, near vision was now good. Far vision was fluctuating a lot. From 'It's not that bad' to 'I can't see a sh~t.'\n\nSo for the first 3-4 days I was not much, but laying down with my eyes closed and listening to podcasts. Sometimes reading this sub again, thinking that I was not lucky enough with a draw. And then comforting myself that it was way too early to make any conclusions. \n\nNow it's been almost a month post-op. I'm happy to say that most of the negative symptoms are either gone or became more manageable. I do use drops every 3-4 hours still as eyes are still on the dry side, but improving week by week. Glare is almost gone. There is still a bit of a duplication of bright lights, but not as bad as it was. The vision is quite stable. Not as good as it was with glasses, around -0,5 / -0.25 now but I consider this acceptable. \n\nAm I happy? I'm not thrilled. It's better than I feared and worse than I hoped. But overall my quality of life has somewhat improved. And I still hope the healing process will be better with additional time. But even by now it's OK.\n\nFinally I'd like to say 'Thank you' to everyone who has been contributing to this sub with their stories and feedback. You really helped me make my educated decision and weigh risks. To anyone who's considering to do the operation: do your research. Think of worst case scenarios you can find here and whether you can live with that or not. Take your time to relax post-op and stack up on plenty of patience.",

I stop whenever there is a bug that prevents me from completing the mission. If this happens before I complete my first mission, I will log off and will not come back before the next patch arrives. \n\nQuite often I will not even make to the first half of the mission. Either game crashes, or character glitches, or mission objective will not spawn, like it did in the previous patch.\n\nThis time I managed to fly away from Area 18. The \"find missing cagro\" mission spawned correctly. I was very impressed I could pick up the box and it did not disappear. Satisfied, I went back to A18 to submit the box. Wow. Even landing was more-or-less OK, even though the docking bay did barely fit the Cutlass.\n\nI was really happy that I would be able to complete the mission. I was at the spaceport, the box was in my hands, nothing bad could happen, right? I was looking forward to trying more content in this patch.\n\nWell, I could not be more wrong. Entering the train departing A18 space port, I noticed something strange. The train has departed, but it was not MY train. My train stayed at the station and incoming and outgoing trains were happily transgressing through it, me and the box. Worse, I could not exit my train, because the doors were closed. Not even when the \"real\" train arrived. I guess it was a one way journey after all.\n\nI have exited the game and will not be coming back. Until 3.13. Maybe :)",

If this happens before I complete my first mission, I will log off and will not come back before the next patch arrives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite often I will not even make to the first half of the mission. Either game crashes, or character glitches, or mission objective will not spawn, like it did in the previous patch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time I managed to fly away from Area 18. The &amp;quot;find missing cagro&amp;quot; mission spawned correctly. I was very impressed I could pick up the box and it did not disappear. Satisfied, I went back to A18 to submit the box. Wow. Even landing was more-or-less OK, even though the docking bay did barely fit the Cutlass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was really happy that I would be able to complete the mission. I was at the spaceport, the box was in my hands, nothing bad could happen, right? I was looking forward to trying more content in this patch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I could not be more wrong. Entering the train departing A18 space port, I noticed something strange. The train has departed, but it was not MY train. My train stayed at the station and incoming and outgoing trains were happily transgressing through it, me and the box. Worse, I could not exit my train, because the doors were closed. Not even when the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; train arrived. I guess it was a one way journey after all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have exited the game and will not be coming back. Until 3.13. Maybe :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
