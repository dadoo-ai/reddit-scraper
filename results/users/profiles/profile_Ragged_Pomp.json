I purchased a USB to HDMI Adapter on amazon. I’ll also provide the link below for that and my MacBook does not register that I’m trying to connect new external displays. \n\nIf your still here I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing any suggestions \n\nThe link for the technical specifications and previously purchased devices are below. \n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/111959\nhttps://a.co/d/03qJoH4\n\nAlso here are the possible ports I can use to connect\n* Two Thunderbolt 2 ports (up to 20 Gbps)\n* Two USB 3 ports (up to 5 Gbps)\n* HDMI port\n",
