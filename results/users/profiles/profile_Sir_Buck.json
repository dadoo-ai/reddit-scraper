The main difference is the water resistance for me - I'm just thinking about this rainy city days, also having a scooter that goes 28 mph sounds sweet (although kinda unecessary)\n\nAnyway, just wanted to hear from owners' experiences of either scooter or those who have tried them out and ridden them in a metro area.
