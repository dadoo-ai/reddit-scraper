Or even just basic LWC patterns - I remember my decorators of course, they&amp;#39;re easy, and the html directives aren&amp;#39;t too bad - but anything more complex and my brain seems to not retain it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to be applicable for typescript as well. I&amp;#39;m fairly good at remembering syntax in JavaScript, but trying to add that typed layer is driving me up the wall because I just don&amp;#39;t remember the syntax. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to be ok at knowing what I need to get done, and the overall steps to that - but not the specific words and instructions to get it done without looking it up all over again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I doing something wrong? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Then you create a named credential that uses the external credential, and allow formulas in HTTP header and body (two checkboxes).\n\nMy Apex code follows in a new comment because Reddit complained about length. \n\nA few other things I discovered:\n\n* When debugging, `{!$Credential.API_Name_Of_External_Credential.clientId}` does NOT convert to the actual credentials in the developer console. The best way to verify errors with the credentials is to look at the receiving system's logs to see what got sent over in the request. Even the JSON body, when debugged, does not replace the formula. The formulas are replaced by Salesforce at runtime and do not display outwardly.\n* The same does NOT apply if you debug the JSON response - you will see the actual access token output. From what I can see, there's no way to store the received token back into the Named Credential or External Credential for future callouts. So, what I'm doing is in each call to the actual endpoint I want, I'm getting the AuthResponse from `getAccessToken()` and then using it in later calls with a Bearer String. I'm looking into ways to do this better.\n* If you have multiple Named Credentials (our system has different credentials based on region) you can set the Named Credential system name via a string. This means you'd end up with something that looks like `request.setEndpoint('callout:' + namedCredentialName);` and this is valid. Same with setting the API name of the External Credential. The entire formula string {!$Credential...} can be stored in a string variable and passed around.\n* There's a new way from API 59 onward to get Named Credentials from the system. Previously, you would need to use a SOQL call (`NamedCredential cred = [Select Id, Endpoint... FROM NamedCredential WHERE DeveloperName = :devName LIMIT 1];`) but Endpoint and other URL values are deprecated since API 56. Newer types of credentials can be retrieved using `ConnectApi.NamedCredential cred = ConnectApi.NamedCredentials.getNamedCredential(devName);` which allows you to do other things. For example, if you need the endpoint/url from the named credential, you can now get that using `cred.calloutUr`l - this also allows you to acces other parameters of the Named Credential.[ Documentation is here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.246.0.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_connectapi_output_named_credential.htm) (this wasn't easy to find!)\n\nThis was a major journey - you definitely helped as well, and thank you for everything you provided and wrote up! The piece I want to figure out is the best way to store the received accessToken and refreshToken securely, I don't like just passing it around Apex and discarding it. I think there may be a way using NamedCredentialParameter but I'm not sure yet.",

Does that mean that I owe tax on the premium as though it was income? \n* As part of private medical insurance, pre-existing conditions are excluded from cover. Living in the States for 16 years, I've got a few of those. Are there any health insurance plans or supplements that will pick up costs associated with pre-existing conditions? \n* They are offering a retirement savings plan where I contribute 5% of my qualifying band earnings and the company contributes 3%. This seems more like a 401K than a pension; am I right? A later part of the benefits document calls it a pension, but is it? \n* I don't have any retirement savings in the UK right now, but I do have a US 401K I've been contributing to.

I've got debt that I hope to clear from the sale of the house, but an excellent payment history (8 years no missed payments). Will any of this help me seeking credit options in the UK? \n* Broadly, do UK mortgages operate the same as the US?

He is a US citizen. My work is sending me to the UK to help start operations there, so we're going to be moving to London! \n\nWe had intended to explore moving to the UK in 2020, but then the pandemic hit so we decided to focus on US living and bought a house together in 2021. We'd been living together since 2014, but renting that time previously. \n\nI have a few questions about the visa process that are kind of unique to our situation: \n\n* When I first met my husband in 2014, I actually became the third in a throuple relationship. He was, at the time, in an unmarried relationship with someone for 10 years prior. I came in, established a romantic relationship with both of them, and we all lived together until 2019 when the original boyfriend left the picture. We're no contact now with that third. **Is this going to cause any kind of red flag during the visa process?** \n* My company is paying for a lawyer to prepare and file the application and represent us during the process. They're wanting to charge my company £15,000 - £10K of which is just their fees. This feels... high? Besides question 1, this seems like a really straightforward case. Together for 8 1/2 years, just over 3 married, we had no current intention to move over until my company offered me a position, so is £10K appropriate for legal costs? \n* Because my start date is June 1st, I'm not there yet. So I don't have an address to give them on where we're going to live. How does that work? \n* I earn comfortably over the threshold to support my husband, however, I don't have any payroll history in the UK. It's all US based. My first UK payroll will be July. Is the job offer plus prior US employment history with the same company enough to cover this requirement? \n* I've gotten conflicting information on whether a spousal visa will allow my husband to find a job. Is that going to be something we need to address? \n* What's a share code? I'm told I need one to prove right to rent? \n* Anything else I really should be thinking about that I'm not? \n\nThanks in advance; I know that of course there's no guarantees and no one can tell me 100% what will happen, but any advice would be amazing!",

    "body": "Relocating from US to UK - reasonable salary increase request?\n\nHi there,\n\nI am a dual US/UK citizen currently working in California. My OTE for 2023 is $220K. They’ve offered me a package to move to London and help start ops there for £180K. When we talked about it, the exchange rate put what I was set at £178, so rounded up. (It’s now the other way around but that’s ok). They also have said they’ll pay for expenses to relocate - let’s assume a max of $10K for that, but they haven’t officially capped it. Also they’re including a round trip flight back to the US for my husband and I once a year while I’m in the UK. They’re also paying for legal advice and government fees for husbands visa, but I think they might be being overcharged by about £10K. Also paying for one hour tax consultation with a large international tax firm. They may pay for the tax prep, but they aren’t sure yet. \n\nI was about to sign my UK contract but then I ran a take home pay analysis. In California my take home pay would be about $139K (£115K) but with higher tax in the UK, my take home would be £101K. \n\nThat’s £14K out of my pocket and doesn’t account for what I’ll have to pay in US taxes as well. \n\nTo get to a similar takehome position, I would need to earn £200K flat. An increase on what I’m offered now by £20K. \n\nIt is reasonable to point out I did get a raise in December before this opportunity came up, of $20K OTE. But given the higher cost of living (London instead of a small town in central valley CA)… am I being unreasonable if I ask for an addition to my comp?",

This isn’t really *homework* but I’m terribly confused on something, and don’t know where else to put it. \n\nI’m an insurance professional, looking to jump from sales to underwriting. Currently taking a course called the RPLU, which includes a financial analysis module for things like underwriting D&amp;O, Fiduciary and Crime coverages. We’ve come to the section on cash flow, and how to calculate / reconcile net cash from activities. \n\nIn the sample cash flow statement provided by the class, under operating activities, there’s net income, and then added to that is amortisation and depreciation. What I’m trying to figure out, and can’t figure it out from googling, is **how is depreciation and amortisation an increase of cash?** Most of the rest of the statement I understand, but this just feels like producing money from thin air which obviously can’t be done, right? You still have to sum it all up to be cash that has actually flowed into or out of the coffers, no? \n\nI hope I’m not breaking a rule by posting; for r/insurance we have the public sub and a private pros sub. Couldn’t find such a distinction. \n\nThanks all!",

Does anyone know how to do this, or have a better way / idea? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited for formatting and to add: I&amp;#39;ve set up a &amp;quot;list&amp;quot; data validation on the Class Code field so that the user can only enter codes that appear in that main code column. They&amp;#39;re stored as text for the leading zeros (formatting didn&amp;#39;t work for some reason)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The day after he quit, which was his last day, I met him at the truck and had him sign a voluntary release form, gave him his final paycheck for 56 hours that whole week (at minimum wage; he was a piece-rate driver but was slower than anticipated) and we parted ways. \n\nI received a notice of claim and conference today, claiming 65 hours instead of 56, and he wants $90. The box saying \"additional wages accrued... as a penalty at the rate of...\" was also checked, but no penalty rate was entered. \n\nWe had no idea he wanted more. For him to have worked 65 hours would mean he didn't take any of the rest breaks he was required to while driving. \n\nThe balance claimed due is $90. My questions are: \n\n* Is it worth it just to make this go away? \n* If we pay the claim, are we likely to have anything else coming after us? \n* Does this count as a judgment against our company if we choose to simply pay what he wants rather than fight it?\n* Is it worth writing a letter to the labor commissioner indicating that 65 hours would mean he didn't take rest breaks? \n\nEdit: Just to be clear - we have no problem paying him what he is owed, I'm a bit annoyed that he didn't take his breaks but OK. I just want to make sure that by just paying it and being done we're not doing some other harm to ourselves. \n\nThanks!",

My questions are: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is it worth it just to make this go away? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If we pay the claim, are we likely to have anything else coming after us? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does this count as a judgment against our company if we choose to simply pay what he wants rather than fight it?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is it worth writing a letter to the labor commissioner indicating that 65 hours would mean he didn&amp;#39;t take rest breaks? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Just to be clear - we have no problem paying him what he is owed, I&amp;#39;m a bit annoyed that he didn&amp;#39;t take his breaks but OK. I just want to make sure that by just paying it and being done we&amp;#39;re not doing some other harm to ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
