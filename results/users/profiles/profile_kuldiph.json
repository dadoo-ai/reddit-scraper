However, over time as your become known as the go-to for your domain expertise / speciality, do raise your rate to denote your premium. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, if and when you do charge a premium rate, make sure the entire client interaction experience from the initial call to the final project close meet if of the highest quality. The buyer definitely expects more  when they are paying more. The quality of engagement is as important as the quality of your work product. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parting Thought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned in life, excellence is rare. Moreover, excellence is self-evident. With that, &lt;strong&gt;strive for excellence&lt;/strong&gt;. Your customers will be happy, and you will be too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
