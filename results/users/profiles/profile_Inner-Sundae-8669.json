    "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm reaching out for help with a persistent and incredibly frustrating issue I'm having setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for 3D printer control. I've been trying for days and have exhausted every troubleshooting step I can think of, including swapping out literally every component, and I'm hoping someone here might have encountered a similar obscure problem or can suggest a diagnostic step I've missed.\n\n**My Goal:** To get either OctoPrint or Mainsail (Klipper) running reliably on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to control my Creality CR-10.\n\n**The Problem / Symptoms:** After flashing an OS image to an SD card and plugging in power, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W consistently shows the following LED pattern:\n\n* The **green ACT LED is almost solid on**, only **blinking off for an instant every few seconds**.\n* This behavior suggests the Pi is powering on and beginning to load the OS, but then failing to fully boot or mount the main filesystem (`rootfs`).\n* The Pi **never appears on my network's connected devices list** (checked via router admin page).\n* Attempting to access [`http://octopi.local/`](http://octopi.local/) (or `http://mainsailos.local/`) or any expected IP address **always fails**.\n\n**What I Have Already Tried &amp; Confirmed (Extensive Troubleshooting!):**\n\n**Hardware:**\n\n* **Raspberry Pi Units:** Tried **two** different Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W boards. Both exhibit the exact same behavior.\n* **Power Supplies:** Tried **two** different power supplies, both confirmed 5V and rated at 2.5A or 3A.\n* **USB Power Cords:** Tried **multiple** different micro USB power cords.\n* **SD Cards:** Tried **four** different microSD cards:\n   * An old SanDisk SD card.\n   * Two PNY brand cards.\n   * A brand new **SanDisk Ultra** card (which should be reliable).\n   * All cards were formatted using **SD Card Formatter (full overwrite format)** before flashing.\n* **SD Card Readers:** Used **two** different card readers: one built-in (SDXC brand) and a separate uGreen external reader.\n\n**Software &amp; Flashing Process:**\n\n* **Operating Systems (Images):**\n   * Official **Raspberry Pi OS Lite**.\n   * **OctoPi** (OctoPrint distribution).\n   * **MainsailOS** (specifically the `raspberry_pi-arm64` version: `2025-05-19-MainsailOS-raspberry_pi-arm64-bookworm-2.0.0.img.xz`).\n* **Flashing Tools:** Both **Raspberry Pi Imager** and **Balena Etcher** have been used. \n\n**Network &amp; Configuration:**\n\n* **Wi-Fi Configuration:** For OctoPi, I meticulously edited `octopi-wpa-supplicant.txt`. For MainsailOS, I edited `network-config`.\n   * I used a **plain text editor (Notepad on Windows)** for all edits.\n   * I confirmed SSID, password (PSK), and country code (`US`) are **uncommented and exactly correct**, including case-sensitivity and no extra spaces.\n   * I **safely ejected the SD card** every single time after flashing and after editing the configuration file.\n* **Network Type:** My Wi-Fi network is 2.4GHz.\n* **Router:** My router's connected devices list **never shows the Pi** connecting. (Router make/model \\[optional\\]). No unusual settings like MAC filtering or AP isolation are active (to my knowledge).\n\n**My Question to the Community:** Given the sheer number of components I've swapped and steps I've meticulously followed, what could possibly be causing this persistent boot failure (green LED pattern) and lack of network connection?\n\n* Are there any incredibly obscure common pitfalls I might be missing?\n* Are there any specific diagnostic steps I can take without a monitor (e.g., specific LED blink codes for the Zero 2 W for this issue)?\n* Could a router setting be *so* subtle it prevents even initial network registration?\n\nAny insights or suggestions would be immensely appreciated. I'm truly at my wit's end trying to get this going.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and help!",

I think earning pd2 is an excellent education that will make you a better developer.   But I also get the frustration.  All certs are a pain,  and others don't at all imagine how much work they were.   It feels life the boss for example thinks ok,  he worked 4 hours to earn a cert.  It's like,  for sins of these, try more like 200hrs!  That one in particular took me about that is think.  6 months of pretty much every night.

This is a competition,  are you competing?  At this point it&amp;#39;s marketing,  so how is product being presented?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You said you take things at a good pace,  I find that a bit concerning,  just because,  as someone who has never had success with women,  I&amp;#39;m not sure what you&amp;#39;re basing that off of.   I&amp;#39;m not necessarily talking about you now just humanity at large,  one we tend to is whatever random we accidentally did the first time,  threatened by the idea that something we did was wrong so we just rationalize &amp;quot;it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what I do&amp;quot;.  Without actually getting systematic,  testing out different behaviors,  conducting market research (asking for honest feedback etc.)\nI&amp;#39;m a bit older now and being older is such an advantage,  at some point you finally become willing to change,  willing to be wrong,  glad to be wrong even because if I know I was wrong,  I know where make adjustments for the next experiment.  This will work for professional pursuits,  social pursuits, and every other thing one could possibly pursue.   Assume everything you&amp;#39;re doing is wrong,  but that&amp;#39;s ok,  you&amp;#39;re not supposed to know everything,  you&amp;#39;re just supposed to learn from everything,  learning is drastically if what we&amp;#39;re already is good,  with absolutely no reason to believe it&amp;#39;s good,  and substantial evidence that what we&amp;#39;re doing isn&amp;#39;t good.
