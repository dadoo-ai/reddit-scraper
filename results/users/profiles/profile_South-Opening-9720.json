    "body": "# What is Chat Data?\n\n[Watch this short intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYmcWP9_IIk&amp;t=17s)\n\n## About Me\nA year ago, I was a full-time software engineer in the Bay Area. Today, I’m the founder of Chat Data, a solo startup generating $25,000 MRR.\n\nMany people see indie development as a pathway to easy passive income, assuming that success is simple, sustainable, and glamorous. The perception is that creating a small startup leads to financial freedom with minimal effort—a lifestyle they aspire to. But the reality is often far from that, and a SaaS project is never a passive income source. You have to work continuously to grow it in a meaningful way because competition is always emerging, and customer requirements keep changing.\n\n## The Realities of Startup Life\nFrom the outside, people see the appealing parts of running a startup. They overlook the sacrifices it takes to reach even modest success, which is why many startups don’t make it. Most people are motivated by a desire to escape demanding jobs where their hard work primarily benefits someone else. This frustration can fuel the ambition to launch a startup, assuming it will yield greater financial freedom and self-direction.\n\nI had similar thoughts when I was at Snapchat, where I worked over 40 hours a week with a $400K total compensation. I was ready for a change. But if I had known the level of difficulty involved in starting a startup, I might have thought twice before leaving a $400K TC job. The first six months required 16-hour workdays, seven days a week, with an MRR under $500 and expenses more than $1000. The financial strain, especially in the Bay Area, was daunting. And beyond financial concerns, the time commitment can strain personal relationships and health.\n\n## How Chat Data Came to Be\nWith six years as a full-stack engineer at Google and Snapchat, I had experience managing entire web projects. I saw websites with basic functionality generating significant income, and I thought I could build something similar. My work at Snapchat also focused on a specific area of advertisement, but I had a vision for creating a complete product, such as YouTube.\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched, I saw an opportunity. This innovation felt groundbreaking, and I believed I had the skills to build an end-to-end product around it. In early 2023, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology was emerging as a solution for long-form and knowledge-based queries, which ChatGPT struggled to answer. After discussing ideas with a professor friend, I developed [Medical Chat](https://medical.chat-data.com/), a product that uses RAG and curated medical databases to deliver accurate answers for healthcare professionals. For general practitioners, it meant confidently answering complex medical questions without extensive research.\n\nThus, Medical Chat was born as a consumer-facing product to answer medical questions for both laypeople and healthcare professionals. However, while healthcare consumers appreciated the concept, they didn’t prioritize features like HIPAA compliance and often sought free solutions. Medical Chat didn’t attract as many consumer subscriptions as I had hoped, but it did capture the interest of healthcare businesses. Many of these businesses wanted a white-label version or API integration to support their own patient bases of 5,000 to 50,000 clients.\n\nThrough this experience, I realized that product development is only about 20% of a startup’s work; the remaining 80% is marketing and user acquisition. A startup’s most valuable asset is not the product—it’s the user base. As a solo founder, balancing product development, customer feedback, SEO, and marketing was exhausting, and I didn’t have time to seek funding.\n\nTo streamline my efforts, I decided to pivot toward a broader solution—a customizable chatbot platform that could serve various businesses. This would allow business owners to build chatbots with their own data and knowledge base, while we also provide a medical knowledge base for healthcare clients if needed. We offer a HIPAA-compliant option to meet regulatory requirements.\n\nIn short, the vision for Chat Data is to create a flexible, business-friendly chatbot solution with customizable front and back ends. My focus shifted to marketing to small businesses, reducing the need for large-scale traffic acquisition (which I’m not experienced in) and allowing me to concentrate on building a high-quality product (which I’m skilled at).\n\n**That’s how Chat Data was born.**\n\nTo be continued...\n",

There are lots of things we get your covered but those competiors don't.\n\n1. Accuracy: We have achieved 98.1% (637/649) on the USMLE sample test. We also have achieved 97.8% (1245/1273) accuracy on the MedQA sample test. You can review this detailed report( https://medical.chat-data.com/evaluate ) for the full evaluation process. The evaluation procedure is also open sourced in this GitHub repository ( https://github.com/chat-data-llc/medical\\_chat\\_performance\\_evaluation ).

It's not just another AI chatbot - it actually learns from past interactions to give more personalized responses. We saw our resolution times drop and customer satisfaction shoot up. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with human agents when needed. Maybe something like that could help you too? Beyond tech, we also started doing regular \"empathy training\" for our team. It's amazing how much better conversations go when agents really put themselves in the customer's shoes. Hope these ideas help!",

I've been using Chat Data for my site, and it handles most issues instantly. The cool part is it can escalate to a human when needed, so you get the best of both worlds.

I found Chat Data great for making more functional bots too, like for customer service. Either way, it's awesome to see creators like you pushing the boundaries of what chatbots can do. Hope Himeno is a hit with fans!",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, congrats on getting back into chatbot creation! Himeno sounds like a fun character to interact with. I&amp;#39;ve been exploring AI chatbots lately too, using Chat Data for some projects. It&amp;#39;s cool how you can customize the personality and dialogue to really bring characters to life. Have you thought about expanding beyond character bots? I found Chat Data great for making more functional bots too, like for customer service.

The customization options are awesome - you can really tailor it to fit specific knowledge domains. Have you thought about how you'll train the chatbot? With Chat Data, I was able to use both structured and unstructured data which gave it a really natural feel in conversations. Curious to hear more about how this Ismaili Gnosis bot will work!",

It's been a game-changer for me. I use it to handle customer queries and log orders automatically, which sounds like exactly what you're after. The best part? It's pretty flexible cost-wise, so you're not locked into hefty ongoing fees while you're scaling up.
