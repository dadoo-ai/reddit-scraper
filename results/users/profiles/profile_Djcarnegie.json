    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a major highway before sunset four lanes were gradually merging to three because there was a flashing unit in one lane telling people to merge. \nI was in the line of the fourth lane and cars ahead me were merging. \nThe traffic attendant officer on the side of the road started gesturing but did not have a Stop sign. \nI assumed he was only gesturing for people in lane 4 to merge to lane 3, which we were doing. \nIronically I was being extra cautious about merging and going at such a slow speed he must have assumed I would be stopping.\nHe stepped out in front of my car and before I could fully stop got hit by my car.  After that he walked around to my windshield and started knocking on my car, yelled &amp;#39;Stop&amp;#39; and next asked me to move over to the side. \nSoon after a police officer who was about 50 yards away came up yelling and asking me why I didn&amp;#39;t follow the directions of the officer to stop.  I was trying to understand and figure out what happened.\nIMO, Definitely not going fast enough to cause a legit injury. \nBut the traffic officer continued what he wanted to do, which was stop cars in both lanes 3 and 4 and then direct 4 to merge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the text from the police report. \n &amp;quot;I witness when Officer was gesturing to the traffic in the 4th lane to move to their left, when the Mazda got too close and struck him with the right side of the vehicle. Officer refused EMS, however he looked to be limping.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was issued a traffic ticket (failure to follow directions) and an attorney for the Traffic attendant is filing a car accident injury claim against my auto insurance. \nWhat&amp;#39;s my best course of action and how do I handle talking to my own insurance for a recorded statement?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
