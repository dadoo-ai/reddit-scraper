Odoo 19 brings powerful AI features, better performance, and future-proofing benefits, but early adopters risk running into bugs, module incompatibility, and migration complexity. If your business critically depends on stability and custom apps, it’s safer to wait until early 2026 when the version matures. However, if AI-driven automation or new features can directly boost your ROI, testing Odoo 19 in a sandbox now and planning your migration roadmap early could give you a competitive edge. In short: prepare now, adopt when it aligns with your business needs.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d say the decision to migrate from Odoo 18 to 19 should balance innovation with stability. Odoo 19 brings powerful AI features, better performance, and future-proofing benefits, but early adopters risk running into bugs, module incompatibility, and migration complexity. If your business critically depends on stability and custom apps, it’s safer to wait until early 2026 when the version matures.
