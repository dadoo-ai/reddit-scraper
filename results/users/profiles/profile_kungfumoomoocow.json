Will update later with my own purchasing experience. Thanks!\n\nAdditional note: I wish I could have waited for next year’s model with all of the design improvements (mainly rear view wiper) but I’m just concerned I won’t have a reliable car to drive my kiddo around.

I messaged the player earlier today to discuss the consequences of this decision. I asked, outside of character development what do you think would be fair to change mechanically game-wise for your paladin, because you literally have nothing to avenge. He said, nothing should change, because he didn't change his oath, still went through all the paladin training and went on a rampage for the last 10-12 years killing baddies. Do you think this line of thinking is justified or should there be a serious consequence?
