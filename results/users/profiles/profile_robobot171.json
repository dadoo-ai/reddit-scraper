Then I get aware about problems dev team is facing, and they usually tell me \"it appears it was much more complicated than we were assuming at the start, so let's either do it differently or just move the deadline\". Now I need to compromise or bring necessary people together, ask the right questions to figure out how it could be solved. After some firefighting, I move forward to observing product health dashboard, and take some notes. Then I start replying to questions from sales team or customer success whether it is possible to build this or that feature, and trying to explain why a specific request from customer can/should be satisfied or not, and explaining that we have much work in the pipeline and it can't happen immediately. If eventually any adjustments were made, I go and update the roadmap. Then I get to reading, analyzing, sorting, categorizing customer feedback, discussion on social media, therefore analyzing the progress of latest release or launch, planning and deciding on whether we are going to roll out to next user group or make it available for GA or maybe it needs more improvements and fixes. If it is the end of the sprint I must be getting to writing release notes, recording demo videos, communicating with sales, customer support and training and technical writers team to update the help center, guides, also sync with marketing team so they are aware of new releases. \n\nI delegate making announcements about collecting user group for next feature alpha release to our junior PM, then I cherry-pick users from applicants list. Then I separate insights for ideation for new features or improvements that are not directly related to newly launched features/improvements, maybe even do one-on-one customer interviews for picking lighthouse users for new products. Getting in touch with customers asking for interviews is also in my to-do list, but it is usually done by associate PM. Then I will get back to ideation board trying to collect more insights about improvements in the pipeline from various sources which must help me to prioritize roadmap and present it to management. Finally, I go to backlog to prepare for the next sprint or if needed to change the priorities. This is like my routine, not counting some alignment meeting, product strategy review days and stuff that happen from several times in a quarter or in a year. Lastly, at the end of the day I go to reading tech news, product newsletters, M&amp;A, swipe through competitor releases and product hunt launch list, and try to keep up with the industry trends in general.\n\nP.S.

To make activation, adoption, and ongoing engagement achievable and swift for all product teams. Apart from that, we've observed that customer success platforms have some outstanding features and practices that are not available to product teams, such as business-centric approach and ability to align product technical goals with business goals, customer health, renewal and churn metrics, and comprehensive customer lifecycle tracking and management. Recognizing their value, we're integrating these elements to serve product-led companies, especially those without dedicated customer success teams. Our tool will have bidirectional integration with CRMs, in-app analytics tools, help desks, and customer success platforms, making it a perfect addition to any tech stack. \n\nUVP of our tool is that it will deliver product teams with no-code solution for complete user lifecycle management, including user activation, adoption and engagement. This will be a revolutionary solution for B2B SaaS companies and their product teams.\n\nWould this be something you'd find valuable?
