I tested it with GeForceNOW on an android TV box and it does recognize it as a \"Game\" to see the game bar.  \n  \nA workaround I'll try is using XCloud on my Laptop, connected to the TV, but I'd prefer to just use the native app (although it's much worse than even the Chrome Browser on my mac).\n\nWhat's worked for you?",

I was expected to use a Data Analytics platform, in which I am a SME. \n\nAbout a month after I got hired clients started pivoting to an AI platform I have some experience in, so I was expected to move towards AI. After that I moved to the country on a visa. I also earned four professional certifications, and up-skilled as fast as possible.

This is despite getting generous senior colleagues (bless them) to proofread the slides and confirm their accuracy.\n\nRight now I’m missing minor details by not quite understanding deep nuance of the language and hyper-focusing on writing, thus the quality of my other work suffers.\n\nAll of this was discussed to “not be an issue” prior to moving but now there’s constant pressure. I’ve already brought up our interview conversation of language expectations, but he’ll agree then go full two-face right before the client call and rip my face off.\n\nNot sure what to do but if anyone has any advice, even if it’s just to firm up my mentality and block out the fear/negativity I would love to hear it.\n\nCheers.\n\n",

I also have nothing tying me down.\n\nI currently work in a large tech company as a Data Analytics Developer (title: Consultant). I'm kind of hazy on what falls under Software Engineering / IT for a lot of Visas, so I'm not sure what my options are emigrating from Canada (my frame of reference is TN Visa to the States).\n\nThat said, I can get references to work in consultancies in Norway/Denmark/Sweden/Finland or France.\n\nIn addition to the Visa considerations, I just need to understand whether the quality of life would be any better in France/Scandinavia. The top things I care about are as follows:\n\n* Vibrant urban core(s) with at least 1M people\n* Wages near equivalent to Canadian wages and similar purchasing power\n   * If the QoL is better / travel is cheaper / food is cheaper / rent is cheaper, I care much less about wage parity\n* Robust and affordable public transportation (subway, trams, fast inter-city rail)\n* Affordable rent compared to wages (Toronto 1-BR is currently 50% of my take-home salary)\n   * Quiet, well-built apartments would be nice – even at a premium\n* Skiing/Mountain Biking/Rock Climbing would be nice to have accessible (either close by, inexpensive, or both)\n\nSome additional considerations:\n\n* I'm 80% of the way to speaking fluent French with an official University certificate\n* I do not speak Norwegian/Danish/Swedish/Finnish, but I know Norwegian and Swedish are pretty straightforward and almost everyone in their capitals speaks English (I would prefer to assimilate to the language though)\n* My ex lives in Oslo, Norway, so even though it's top of the checklist for amenities, it would probably be my last choice\n\nPlease let me know if my post needs more info and I'll gladly include it.

The reason they offer this is due to a two-year commitment you must sign if you agree to work for them: the commitment has fines for backing out prior to its completion. The purpose of the commitment is twofold: to ensure you do not take the training and run and to ensure the client they place you with will not lose their resource.\n   \nThe fines are ~$10k-20k depending how early you leave (leaving sooner is higher fine). \n   \nThe amount of the fine is quite a large joke – you could do your masters for almost 1/2 of the lowest fine. Yes it is 9-5 while school is definitely not, but the pedigree of training from your masters (in anything mind you) far outweighs this bizarro agreement.\n   \nNow, this would be outweighed by fair and/or increasing compensation, however it most decidedly is not. They are offering $40k first year and $45k second year with the \"potential\" for a hire at the company they place you with. For perspective, I made $35k (on top of benefits) in 2016 as a non-co-op student with zero professional experience. The following year (2017) $45k, again as a non-co-op student. As a fresh grad (2018) I got a job with the federal government at $60k plus pension (unfortunately it was very boring and disorganized).\n   \nRecently I've been looking for work and came across this company – everything they have prior to the interview looks mostly legit, but if you do a google search things become less legit. Confirmed the negatives with the interview and I can conclude this company is a joke.\n   \nTake more time and find something better than this – their salary alone is basically unliveable for Toronto and first-year co-ops pursuing any degree make more money.",

    "body": "Hi /r/rant, \n\nI have never posted on here before, but I need to get some things off my chest (although they are so intractable that I doubt that is possible)\n   \nI recently moved to a new city with my partner – she had a job lined up, so we felt it was the right time to go. We had some lingering relationship problems, but felt it was nothing insurmountable given that we had solved virtually every problem in the past.\n   \nWe could not find an apartment in our ideal area, so we went with something a bit further out but much nicer on the inside – or so we thought.\n   \nThe first day we moved in, we heard loud footsteps from upstairs (like shake the light fixtures loud). We hoped it would pass but it gradually got worse – voices came through the forced-air ducting above our ceiling (the building has an older heating system that has the ducting run under a unit, ie. their ducting is in our ceiling). I can record their conversations word-for-word from our unit. To top it all off, they have children that walk as if in a drunken stupor all day every day – the sound is similar to dropping textbooks on the floor.\n\nNow normally the noise would not be a problem, as I would be out and about either at work or at a coffee shop of some sort. The problem is that I am essentially 'forced' to stay at home due to the lack of alternative places to do desk work in my current community. This essentially traps me with the noise all day; even if I leave, I just expect it when I inevitably return. \n   \nThis has been ongoing for months. We have 6-10 founded noise complaints against them, property management has spoken with them on 2 occasions, and they have/will receive formal cease and desist. Since walking is a human right, we have no legal grounds against them (yes we tried the rug clause in the lease – it did not work). Outcome was that management broke our lease for us and we were free to go.\n   \nYou would think this would be the ultimate resolution, right? Well my partner and I have since struggled for months trying to find a place that suits both our needs. The city is currently facing a housing shortage due to recent movements of several large companies. \n   \nIf you have not gathered this already, I am bound to look for work, apply for jobs, and take interview calls at home or on the building's premises. Despite this, I had the job search wrangled – had an extremely promising opportunity at a major fortune 500 company (made networking connections in a city where I know nobody, gained an internal reference, made it through 7 interviews to the final round, etc.). \n   \nIn between the 6th and 7th interviews, I got in a huge fight with my partner brought on by the stress of being unable to unwind in our own home in addition to our unresolved issues. Result was that I got mentally thrown off track, couldn't sleep well for a few days, and made a small mistake that excluded me from getting the job (I have made that mistake before – always due to lack of sleep). I could not find any other employment avenues for a month straight, so I headed home for a few weeks to regain my sanity.\n\nWhile I was away, I received an email from an online service saying \"your bill has come due, here is your invoice\". I thought \"okay that's weird, maybe it's a phishing scam\". I checked, turned out it was legit. turns out that some time while I was working on my job search, someone hacked my email account, covertly added a filter on my account to send all email from xyz@abc.com to my trash folder so I would not notice, and created a service account linked to my on-file credit card with once of the partnered services. They appeared to be mining bitcoins, although I cannot be sure. The only reason the payment email came through was because of a slightly different syntax (ie. xyx-pay@abc.com). This hack eventually racked up ~$5,000 in fees fraudulently tied to my name.\n   \nAt this point, I became extremely worried, but I was still confident I could resolve the hack. The service support team initially told me it would be no problem: we proved it was fraud and slated the account for deactivation and removal of the outstanding fraudulent balance. Fast forward a few weeks, and the balance had not yet been removed – I thought, okay maybe this just needs some time. NOPE. The balance, while earmarked as fraud, cannot be removed from the account because \"the account was proven fraudulent and once an account is labelled as such, it is locked forever\". Uh, what? So essentially, this charge is tied to my name forever, and, when the company inevitably fails or restructures, this charge could be reapplied to my account and affect my credit.\n   \nSo now, to summarize, my girlfriend and I are on progressively worsening terms, I feel unable to improve those terms due to near constant stress from the noise, I have run out of money (literally I only have enough to service my phone bill, and either my girlfriend or mom pays for all other expenses), I am on the hook for thousands as a result of a PROVEN fraud, and I have no job prospects.\n   \nI have tried fixing all of this: I got the lease broken through discussion and dialogue, I tried amicably speaking with the upstairs tenants, I tried building a personal network in a city where I know no one using virtually no capital, and I tried resolving the fraud through the dedicated support lines. Each time I find a potential solution to one of the multiple issues, it either does not work or completely backfires. \n\nExample: I had an interview call with a company I would love to work for after weeks of no interviews. Great people, great pay, great everything. Prior to the call, no noise; everything was perfect. As soon as the call started, stomping, running, screaming from upstairs. \"I can deal with this\", I thought and proceeded with the call slightly distracted. Then, fire alarm goes off. I politely ask the interviewer to hold while I go to the lobby for some quiet. Elevator is disabled during fire alarms – 10-floor staircase it is. No problem, I still got this. Ask interviewer for another minute. Silent on main floor for 30 seconds, I restart the call. Alarm now goes off on main floor. I finally was able to take the call in the disgusting freight hallway of the auxiliary building, where I finally got my grips. You can guess that this interview was completely boned.\n   \nHonestly, I feel stuck in an endless cycle of dead ends, stress, and punishment for my resourcefulness. I understand that a big part of it could be my attitude, but damn... I had a great attitude until the metaphorical pile of garbage got so tall, so unstable, that when I try to climb it, my foothold breaks loose and I fall the bottom only to climb to the same spot or lower once again.\n   \nI want to give up, but if I do, I have to give up everything and rebuild my career from the ground up. \n   \nI feel completely destroyed.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=\"/r/rant\"&gt;/r/rant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never posted on here before, but I need to get some things off my chest (although they are so intractable that I doubt that is possible)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently moved to a new city with my partner – she had a job lined up, so we felt it was the right time to go. We had some lingering relationship problems, but felt it was nothing insurmountable given that we had solved virtually every problem in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could not find an apartment in our ideal area, so we went with something a bit further out but much nicer on the inside – or so we thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first day we moved in, we heard loud footsteps from upstairs (like shake the light fixtures loud). We hoped it would pass but it gradually got worse – voices came through the forced-air ducting above our ceiling (the building has an older heating system that has the ducting run under a unit, ie. their ducting is in our ceiling). I can record their conversations word-for-word from our unit. To top it all off, they have children that walk as if in a drunken stupor all day every day – the sound is similar to dropping textbooks on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now normally the noise would not be a problem, as I would be out and about either at work or at a coffee shop of some sort. The problem is that I am essentially &amp;#39;forced&amp;#39; to stay at home due to the lack of alternative places to do desk work in my current community. This essentially traps me with the noise all day; even if I leave, I just expect it when I inevitably return. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has been ongoing for months. We have 6-10 founded noise complaints against them, property management has spoken with them on 2 occasions, and they have/will receive formal cease and desist. Since walking is a human right, we have no legal grounds against them (yes we tried the rug clause in the lease – it did not work). Outcome was that management broke our lease for us and we were free to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You would think this would be the ultimate resolution, right? Well my partner and I have since struggled for months trying to find a place that suits both our needs. The city is currently facing a housing shortage due to recent movements of several large companies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have not gathered this already, I am bound to look for work, apply for jobs, and take interview calls at home or on the building&amp;#39;s premises. Despite this, I had the job search wrangled – had an extremely promising opportunity at a major fortune 500 company (made networking connections in a city where I know nobody, gained an internal reference, made it through 7 interviews to the final round, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In between the 6th and 7th interviews, I got in a huge fight with my partner brought on by the stress of being unable to unwind in our own home in addition to our unresolved issues. Result was that I got mentally thrown off track, couldn&amp;#39;t sleep well for a few days, and made a small mistake that excluded me from getting the job (I have made that mistake before – always due to lack of sleep). I could not find any other employment avenues for a month straight, so I headed home for a few weeks to regain my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was away, I received an email from an online service saying &amp;quot;your bill has come due, here is your invoice&amp;quot;.
