Whenever you choose to get married and then have a child, they become your primary responsibility. You can't begin your thought process with the emotional needs of your sibling anymore. I'm not saying you shouldn't still care for your brother, but you have to focus on your wife and child first and foremost and sometimes that will mean leaving your brother's emotional well-being to himself and your parents.  Having families around forces us back into old thought processes and patterns sometimes that distress those around us. \n\nThen, why are you fighting with her dad every time you see him? It's not that difficult to avoid altercations. You write this as a footnote, but it's a huge deal that you clearly can't control your temper around her parents. No matter how rude or aggressive they are, there is nothing with them that you can't solve in a calm and collected way, end of story.",

It sounds like a startup where a someone came from a larger company and said \"let's do this like we did at xyz\" not acknowledging that xyz was 10x larger and had excess staff for every function to handle those complexities. I have a strong feeling that the whole \"team\" dimension could be cut out entirely to just leave seats and region\n\nAnd how you handle these is really about the business reaason that underlies them. For example, are you utilizing team to drive provisioning &amp; pricing, just one of the two or neither, and then how can we maybe simplify the representation of that, or split up the calculation.  What granularity is actually needed to properly drive them? Can you deal with total count per region-line or do you need the exact breakdown?",
