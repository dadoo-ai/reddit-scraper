I also wear it fairly tight so that it doesn't lose position during the night.\n\nI'm a side sleeper and use an old beat-up flat pillow.  You have to be careful not to put pressure on your neck or you'll lose the advantage of the collar.\n\nSnore Lab went from lots of snoring (though nothing prolonged and intense) to zero.\n\nI'm a fit male, so your mileage may vary.
