    "communityName": "r/wine",
    "parsedCommunityName": "wine",
    "body": "I’ve been thinking about these impending US tariffs on old world wine, and have been thinking about how often innovation is born through hardship. I'd hate to see these tariffs fall into place, and that would be devastating for US imports of European wine. However, I think that with the right combination of talent, climate, and vineyard management, US producers *could* be able to produce some of the best red blends in the world—comparable to many top producers, if not go toe-to-toe with first growth. \n\nI recognize there are major differences in terroir, tradition, and climate, but I don’t think they’re *categorically impossible* to overcome. I’d argue most of those elements can be overcome or reimagined through thoughtful winemaking.\n\nThat said, here are a few areas where I know skeptics might push back—and I’m open to being convinced:\n\n# 1. U.S. Terroir Is Different, Not Inferior\n\nYes, Bordeaux and Loire sit on ancient soils with millions of years of mineral layering and perfect water-retention profiles. But U.S. regions like Napa, Walla Walla, or even Paso Robles have their own distinct terroir—sometimes younger or more volcanic, but still capable of producing deep, complex wines. I don't believe that terroir alone is a distinguishing factor and through careful cultivation and selection of growing regions, could be managed. \n\n# 2. Climate Can Be Managed\n\nThe U.S. tends to run hotter in many key wine regions, but winemakers can (and do) manage brix, acid retention, canopy, and irrigation strategically and effectively. Bordeaux has more weather volatility year-to-year, so I'm not sure \"predictability\" is a huge advantage there either.\n\n# 3. Creative Freedom in the U.S. Is a Strength\n\nFrench AOC laws are rigid—you can’t innovate as easily or take risks on blends. The U.S., by contrast, allows winemakers to experiment and refine, which I see as an edge. The University of Minnesota for example is focused on creating cold-hardy wines, but other state universities could apply their approach to warmer climes to innovate new varietals to hotter, richer soils. \n\n# 4. Reputation Isn't Quality\n\nYes, Bordeaux houses have hundreds of years of history and established reputations. But that doesn’t mean a younger U.S. wine can’t be as good or better. It just means it will take time to earn that same level of trust and prestige on the global stage. All things change in time. \n\n# 5. We’re Already Close\n\nWines like Dominus, Continuum, Opus One, and even less flashy producers like Tablas Creek or Quilceda Creek are already delivering world-class red blends. Some have *already* beaten First Growth Bordeaux wines in blind tastings.\n\n# Change My View:\n\nIs there something *categorically* unique about Bordeaux and Loire terroir that makes it strictly impossible for U.S. winemakers to produce wines that are on par with 1er Crus? Or is it just a matter of time, taste, and trust?\n\nWould love to hear from the experts of this sub (and I know there's plenty) who think I’m missing a key piece of the puzzle. ",

    "body": "I have been working for a contracting agency on a 6 month contract for the last few months at a large bank downtown. The pay is great and I have no complaints about the work. The only problem I've got is that after this 6 month term I'd like to work as an independant contractor with this bank. The firm I represent never sent me a non-compete agreement when I initially agreed to contract with them, yet they assumed I did. Nobody ever told me about a non-compete contract, and I have no evidence that they attempted to do so. My email correspondance with their HR contact contained no non-compete contracts to sign and no attachments where I could read it. It's not on their sharepoint site. My emails with the recruiter never mentioned a non-compete clause. Now that I'm interested in working as an independent contractor I was curious if they had a clause and they informed me they do, and they said I signed it. I asked to see a copy of the signed contract. They sent me the form with my details in it, with no signature or date in my spot. I asked if they could provide any record that I agreed or consented to this contract, and they could not. They then asked that I sign and return the non-compete right away. If I want to work as an independant contractor after my term expires, what should I do? I am not in any legal hot water yet but I want to make sure I don't get in any. I am thinking that I ask to sign an amended contract where I can ask to have an independant contractor exemption once my 6 month employment term is over. What's your advice? I don't want any injunctions filed if I go independent.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been working for a contracting agency on a 6 month contract for the last few months at a large bank downtown. The pay is great and I have no complaints about the work. The only problem I&amp;#39;ve got is that after this 6 month term I&amp;#39;d like to work as an independant contractor with this bank. The firm I represent never sent me a non-compete agreement when I initially agreed to contract with them, yet they assumed I did. Nobody ever told me about a non-compete contract, and I have no evidence that they attempted to do so. My email correspondance with their HR contact contained no non-compete contracts to sign and no attachments where I could read it. It&amp;#39;s not on their sharepoint site. My emails with the recruiter never mentioned a non-compete clause. Now that I&amp;#39;m interested in working as an independent contractor I was curious if they had a clause and they informed me they do, and they said I signed it. I asked to see a copy of the signed contract. They sent me the form with my details in it, with no signature or date in my spot. I asked if they could provide any record that I agreed or consented to this contract, and they could not. They then asked that I sign and return the non-compete right away. If I want to work as an independant contractor after my term expires, what should I do? I am not in any legal hot water yet but I want to make sure I don&amp;#39;t get in any. I am thinking that I ask to sign an amended contract where I can ask to have an independant contractor exemption once my 6 month employment term is over. What&amp;#39;s your advice? I don&amp;#39;t want any injunctions filed if I go independent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We found most of these brands to be too mod for a kids' room but ultimately found that Room &amp; Board and Ikea had styles that would be suitable for our kids' room. The difference in price was $650 vs nearly $5000. For that $4350 difference I can invest it, earning 12% in the market and in 10 years when that furniture is on its last legs, that $4350 will have earned me an extra $9160.

It entirely depends on how long a term you're looking at, what you're looking to purchase, and what you need out of the item. \n\nCould I have afforded something BIFL-worth for my kids? Sure.

I've seen a lot of grinders optimized for espresso, but french press is really my mainstay. What works well for consistent coarse grinds?\n\n3: Mess / static.

Also, in dry weather the static gets so bad that as soon as I open the basket I have ground coffee leaping out.\n\nFor the cost of a Rancilio Rocky I could buy 3 or 4 Capresso Infinities which theoretically can last me up to 40 years.

My wife is keen on getting me some sweaters this Christmas but I don’t know what to recommend. We tried on some Woolrich classic sweaters this weekend and they were very scratchy and bulky. I tried on some stuff from Dale of Norway and I liked them a lot better - still 100% wool but they ranged from comfortable to only slightly scratchy. They were also fairly expensive but I know they’re guaranteed for life. \n\nRegarding style, I like fair isle patterns but my wife hates them and will only tolerate minimal patterning. She’s much more partial to Irish fisherman patterns and I like them too. \n\nWhat are your go-to recommendations on BIFL sweaters, and what should I be looking at to compare them?

They were unbelievably good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must have done something right by overcooking the gnocchi but I&amp;#39;m not completely sure what it was - did I wash off enough starch and allow extra gluten on the outside to respond better to the pan-sear? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "I'm well versed in the CDC and AAP recommendations regarding heating breast milk in the microwave, but something about it doesn't seem to ring true to me in terms of the science behind it. \n\nAs I understand it, the primary concern is super-heating the milk so that it destroys the beneficial antibodies present, but there is a secondary concern of scalding the child due to excessive overheating of the milk. \n\nI'm just going to start with some assumptions here and assume we're all careful and trained enough with our microwaves as to not overheat the milk, not thaw frozen milk, not to heat a sealed container, and to use a proper microwave-safe container. Let's also assume our goal is to not heat the milk to or above 98.6F (37C), but to simply take the \"chill\" off of refrigerated milk. That might be anywhere between 70-90F (21-32C). \n\nThe goal here is to use the microwave as a fast and efficient means of heating the milk. I think with a proper understanding of the mechanics of heat transfer you can safely heat breast milk with minimum side-effects.\n\nTo support this, there was an [article written in 1996 in the International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8889628) which supports that as long as the temperatures were below 140F (40C) that there was no adverse impact on immunoglobulin levels, for conventional or microwave heating methods. I've found no similar study. There was [another study in the American Journal of Pediatrics](http://m.pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/89/4/667.short) that dealt with microwaving frozen milk, but since the method of microwaving frozen milk is [vastly different to that of microwaving liquid milk](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/experiments/exp/-324719c1f8/), these studies cannot be considered to be comparable. \n\nIn order to safely heat your breast milk I propose the following:\n\n**General requirements:**\n\n1. Have a solid understanding of your microwave's power levels. They often vary and it's important to know how much or little power is necessary to heat your milk to an appropriate level. \n\n2. Have an understanding of how changing the volume of milk can change the time necessary to heat it properly. 2oz will heat much faster than 4oz.\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Heat for short bursts. 10-15 seconds.\n\n2. Take the milk out and swirl around in order to distribute the heat\n\n3. Test the milk. Warm enough? You're done. Still cold? Go back to step 1.\n\nWhat's your take on this Reddit?",

We've always done our best to adopt a consistent bed time and bedtime ritual but lately it's anything but. Within the last 4 months we've purchased a light timer that goes on downstairs to signal his bedtime and to start winding down for sleep, and his room light turns off automatically when it's time for light's out. In addition to that, our bedtime ritual is always the same: diaper, PJs, warm milk, brushing teeth, books, bed. He's a fantastic manipulator and is always trying to divert from the schedule - sometimes he refuses the diaper or the PJs or wants the light on. He requests extra books, wants extra food before bed, wants to go to the potty (and more often than not can actually go), wants a kiss from the other parent, fusses with his night light, his toys, wants to be tucked in, you name it. Just about any delay he can find. We didn't use to give in to his requests but when he says he's hungry or needs to go to the potty we feel compelled to give in. It's become such a fight recently that I am starting to worry he's developing a massive negative association with this necessary activity. We go through this fight every single night. He's still napping and fights those as well but less so - he naps roughly 2-3 hours and sleeps about 10 hours at night. I almost think if we cut the naps he might be more tired and accepting of bedtime but am afraid the extra exhaustion will make things worse. What kinds of recommendations would you give to improve our situation? Are we giving in too much? Do we need a schedule change? ",

Since then we've had fantastic luck with renters, never had a gap in occupancy and we've had to do very little maintenance to the home. Right now the money we make in rent is basically keeping all the bills paid and is building equity in the house but nothing extra is being put away for maintenance or updates. The value of the home has slowly increased in the past few years and we're now able to sell the home for more than we owe in its mortgage. We paid $190k in 2005 and it's now worth a (Zillow) estimated $155k - our loan is $122k. We rent it for $1280 which covers all expenses, mortgage, dues, and tax and is comparable for townhomes of its size in the area. \n\nOne the one hand, I'm tempted by selling: we've been lucky with having great renters and few updates, but any day a major appliance could go, a tenant could leave, and our situation could change quickly. This would allow us to cash-in and I would roll the money into our retirement investments. \n\nOn the other hand, everything seems to be going well and our renters are happy. They pay on time, never complain, and while we aren't taking home money we are building equity. If we were to spend some money up front to refinance this property we could change this situation from cash neutral to cash positive. We've got fantastic credit and based on conservative interest estimates this would change our mortgage+association to $1010, netting $270 per month. \n\nFrom a personal perspective, we're expecting our second child in January and life's about to get more hectic than usual. I'm fairly handy and also have in-laws that manage properties that can help with anything complicated so my maintenance costs have always been low but time commitments are higher. We don't really need the monthly income and I'd likely just invest any overage that isn't needed to keep on hand to handle any emergency repairs or replacements in the property. \n\nTL/DR: When the ROI of a rental property is roughly equal to the investment potential of its net proceeds, wat do?",

    "body": "**tl;dr**: I no longer want to speak to my MIL about anything and need some help on how to make it through the next couple of weeks without some serious damage being done. \n\nStory below - sorry for the wall of text but there's a lot of details and feelings here to unpack.\n\nMy wife had been bugging me for us to move out of our home for a while now - ever since we started to have issues with security - mail stolen, garage break-ins, and crime in the surrounding area. While safety was her primary concern she made several other points to make her case - better schools, lower taxes, closer to daycare (MIL), and a bigger home made the top of the list. I resisted initially because I loved our home - we spent a lot of time and money fixing it up and I was willing to look past some of it's flaws and knew that there would be no way we could afford the same quality of home and location in a better neighborhood without spending a fortune. My MIL had been campaigning for this for some time: whenever the opportunity would present itself, my MIL would bring up her concerns about the crime rate in our area which after a while started to feel a little derogatory. Nevertheless, I ultimately caved because she is pregnant and I wanted to make sure she felt safe, secure, and content before we have our second child. \n\n\nOur plan was to sell our home in the summer while prices and demand are high and buy in the late summer/fall when demand starts to drop and sellers get desperate to sell before winter. It was a great plan, but it would leave us homeless indefinitely until we found a new home. My wife proposed the idea of moving in with her parents temporarily during this process - we'd move out, stage the home, sell, and then live with her family until we could find a new home to buy. Under most normal circumstances I would never agree to living with her parents but agreed because this solution appealed to me practically and logistically. \n\n\nOnce we moved in, the tension almost immediately started to build. I'm a rather independent and confident person, but my desire at times to make peace has a tendency to override other decisions. My MIL on the other hand second-guesses nearly every decision anyone makes and has no qualms about expressing her opinions freely. She too will try to avoid outright confrontation but very visibly seethes when things aren't going her way. \n\n\nBy living in their house and being a guest, I do my best to remain respectful and to live by her rules, of which there are few, the only one of which bothers me is that our dog who normally lives indoors with and around people must live outside. Being apart from people she gets stressed and acts out in other ways that my MIL doesn't like - she digs, scratches the door, and barks at animals outside. With all the time we've been spending on moving and looking at homes, she's definitely fallen off of the priority list and her acting out is a direct result of that. It bothers me to see her in that state, and I feel helpless to improve her situation. \n\n\nOne of the worst parts of living there is I'm constantly feeling judged by my wife's family. The differences between us are stark but most of them center around how we choose to spend our money. Despite their wealth my wife's family is shockingly frugal: they pack food instead of clothes on vacations, pull wet clothes out of the dryer, etc. Whenever I come home with organic food for my son or something nice for my wife or myself to eat, my MIL always gets this disapproving frown on her face and sometimes says something passive aggressive like \"Well isn't that nice.\" It's made me so self-conscious about it that I rarely even cook anymore - something that I love to do. \n\n\nI've also been insulted by her calling my judgment into question on more than one occasion and it's embarrassing when her visiting family are the ones that stand up in my defense instead of my wife or I. \n\n\nCombined with the insults I've received, the feeling that I'm constantly walking on eggshells, exhaustion from the home move and search, and recently having finished graduate school, I'm a defeated, stressed, mess. I don't feel like myself. I have become very defensive, prone to argument, I no longer do things that I enjoy and generally very unhappy. I don't want to speak to my mother in law at all on any level because I feel like the animosity has reached a fever pitch and I just want to ignore her and ride it out.\n\n\nMy one glimmer of hope is that we recently contracted to purchase a new home and we close in two weeks! I'm so excited to be getting out of my in-law's home but I felt real damage has been done between us by my living there. I feel like the biggest problem we face is that my wife is too easily manipulated by her mother who doesn't approve of how we like to live our lives in general. I think to put it plainly, I feel like she's intolerant and domineering and I want to rid that corrosive element from our lives. What can I do to help repair this damage, but clearly articulate that we get the right to live our lives without having to feel like we're constantly being judged and undermined?\n",

I can make it through in 15 minutes and leave with a nearly-full inventory of rares - 1/3 trips lands a legendary/set item. \n\nRegarding skills, I'm sure some of you might be skeptical about the lightning bolts but I am a big fan - I know everyone uses Ball Lightning but to me they're just so damn slow, and with my crit rate as high as it is, I can basically stun-lock a champion. After 1.0.5, siege engineering changed everything for me. There's nothing more satisfying than laying a nice little ambush of turrets and traps and leading the little lambs to the slaughter and then stun-locking them in a barrage of turret fire. Vigilant watcher was chosen for quicker ambush set-up. Vault is still an indispensable skill for me even after TOC was nerfed since I can utilize it to move more quickly around the map and kill peons along the way.\n\nRight now I feel like I'm hitting a wall in terms of playability and results. I thought I had high resists but soloing any elites over MP2 is pretty challenging and time consuming and I don't think the payoffs are there.

Very sparse, but nice accommodations. He says that based on the other units in the building you would have no idea this apartment exists here. At night, the power gets shut off. It's a very dangerous place for Americans and the police are corrupt. His flight departed from Moscow to an unknown city on Aeroflot and drove 12 hours by car to his destination. This, the locals say, was the most dangerous part of his trip. The area is very impoverished and many people live in converted dumpsters along the side of the road. Most people don't talk to each other - almost everyone walks from place to place. He wasn't required to get a yellow fever vaccine but it was recommended. He is north of Africa.\n\nHere's a list of countries I know he's not in: Russia, China, Georgia, Afghanistan, NKR, Azerbaijan, India, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lithuania, Romania, Armenia, or Turkmenistan.\n\nSo far, I'm guessing Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan. \n\nHere are photos he's taken so far: http://imgur.com/a/aQwjk",
