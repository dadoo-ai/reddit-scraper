The idea of pairing Higgins and Tet is really interesting to me, but realistically if we land Tee I'd like to see us trade down a few spots.

I personally like Darien Porter from Iowa State a lot. There's some debate on where he will go, could be as high as top of the 2nd or down to the mid 4th.

Hard to project in a mock draft so took the \"chalk\" here. \n\nKyle Kennard can really rush the passer and has been productive in the SEC this year. Good player/best available at a position of need. \n\nTreVeyon Henderson is a dynamic RB who can really catch the ball out of the backfield. He'd be a nice compliment to Rhamondre and is a home run hitter. Other option would be Jayden Ott from Cal further down the draft board.

    "body": "Been thinking a lot about this the past few weeks for our rebuilding roadmap and how quickly it may or may not take for us to be a contender again. \n\nI think the 2018 Bills is a a good comparison to how this coming year could look. They went 6-10 and Rookie Josh Allen threw 10 TDs to 12 INTs and ran for another 8 TDs while completing 52% of his passes. Solid defense that year. \n\nThen had a good 2019 draft with Ed Oliver, Devin Singletary, and Dawson Knox. Allen takes a step forward in 2019 with 20-9 3100 yards and 9 rushing TDs while completing 58% of his passes. Team goes 10-6 before 2020 when they trade for Diggs, Allen becomes an elite NFL QB throwing for 4500 yards 37 TDs with 10 INTs and completing 69% of his passes and the Bills are contenders. \n\nAllen played a lot his rookie year, but the Bills also played Nathan Peterman, Derek Anderson, and Matt Barkley that season due to Allen injuries.\n\nLooking at his highlights on YouTube, there are flashes, but it took a while. \n\n[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2018.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2018.htm)",

    "body": "Figured I'd throw this up there for those of us who watch college ball and want to keep an eye out on prospects for the upcoming year. We are in a multi year rebuild and I am operating under the assumption that we have our guy at QB and will not be drafting another one high next year. Even if Drake plays poorly, we won't move on that quickly. We are more likely try to do what the Panthers did this year in spending big money in FA to help the O-Line/WR room or draft key players in need. Thankfully for us we are in a far better draft capitol position than the Panthers. \n\nCouple quick thoughts:\n\n1. Seems the consensus is that there are two top end talent tackles with Banks and Campbell. Jones, Booker, and Simmons are the next group. We'll see what happens this year. \n\n2. QB talent is not as strong as last year, but there's a lot of ball left to play. Jaden Daniels would have been a Day 2 pick at best this time last year. Several of the top QB's playing really well only help us if we land a high pick again. We should be cheering for Ewers, Sanders, Beck, Milroe, Dart, Allar etc to play VERY well and driving a QB rush if possible.\n\n3. Not nearly the same depth at WR, but couple really nice players there. Luther Burden is by far my favorite after watching him last year at Missouri and seems like the consensus WR1. Also personally like Emeka Egbuka and Well's tape when he was at South Carolina last year.\n\n4. It's a deep defensive draft with top end talent at CB, DE, and DT. Hunter, Johnson, Morrison, Burke, are all nice players and then I personally like Muhammed who played at Washington last year, just thought he was a dog in all their big games. Bryant the KU CB is a nice player too. If we determine DE and DT are needs, this is a great draft. \n\n5. Didn't do a ton of work on Safety, but one of my favorite players in CFB is Sonny Styles from OSU. \n\n  \nThere is obviously a lot of moving parts a full season to play, but just a handful of guys to keep an eye on as the college season progresses and we see what we really have on this year's Patriots. A rush at QB is our perfect scenario and more than likely solidifies a shot at one of the OT's or WR1 Burden. ",

I've messed around with the amortization schedule and currently have 21.5 years left on the loan.\n\nPre-house purchase I was DCA'ing about 4k into my mutual funds monthly, buying some individual stocks, and maxing out my 401k/HSA. \n\nNo household debt other than 8k on a used Toyota RAV4.\n\nEdit: 28M fiance is 29F.\n\nFurther Edits: My idea is to do both, keep investing and continue to pay down the mortgage until I get through the first half of the amort chart. \n\nEven more Edits: This is not our forever home unless we are unable to have kids.
