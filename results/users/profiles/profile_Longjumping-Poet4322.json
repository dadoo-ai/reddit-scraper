Good movie btw...\n\nBut one thing that was a pleasant surprise was that there was a handicap seating in front of us and there were giant bars mounted to the floor. So throughout the 94 minutes plus previews I was able to stretch my calves for minutes on end at different heights over a half dozen times. Gastroc, soleus, and achilles all got a really good workout and I didn't think anything of it while I was watching a movie with the kiddos. And my god when I left that theater I felt like a million bucks. No real foot pain and my calves were so much looser.\n\nAnyways this got me thinking... is there any at home or work devices you folks use to help stretch calves? I bought a few 'Foot and Calf Stretcher-Stretching Strap' on Amazon and they work okay... but they are cumbersome to put on. Stretches on the stairs at home probably give me the most relief, but nothing like being able to use all my body weight on the bars at the movie theater... I'm hoping for some sort of physical suggestions where I can use my body weight and watch TV for an hour or so and stretch with some good resistance.\n\nHonestly I'm considering going back to that theater and watching something else because it was so effective.

I'm currently in consulting but recently I'm not really enjoying the work/life balance and it's starting to impact my mental health and time with my family.\n\nLooking back on my career I really enjoyed many things and some I did not. I historically held a technical architect/lead dev role at a company and I think that's something I'd like to look into again. I enjoyed it because I had had a big voice and got to weigh in on critical decisions and really made their SFDC org a success. But honestly if I can achieve most of these below, I think that would make me happy working in a single org.\n\nHere are a few things that I really enjoy:\n\n* Fairly clean and well architected orgs or at least the luxury to work with the business to improve tech debt and clean up problematic areas\n* Teaching/helping/mentoring with colleagues and encouraging collaboration during troubleshooting\n* The ability to weigh in on procurement and managed package license decisions\n* Problem solving and improving business processes via Flows, LWC, and integrations\n\nIf I had to pick a 'dream job', it would be working with a newer Salesforce org for a smaller business. I've found that throughout my career, the bigger companies tend to make poor procurement and architectural decisions within their Salesforce org and it ends up be a mess very quickly. The analogy - fitting a round peg in a square hole is probably a good analogy for many of these scenarios.\n\nI've been gradually networking and putting feelers out there on LinkedIn with recruiters, however I'm wondering if others have had luck achieving a similar 'dream job' and what works. I could always consider joining a client's org after a clean and successful go-live, but I'm really looking for the best way to land that technical architect / admin / BA / solo dev role for a smaller company. Is reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn, explaining my 'dream job' and hoping for a match the best way? The conversations I've had thus far is that the market is fairly cold and there's not a lot of companies offering 150k for an in house dev right now...\n\nSorry for the rant... I guess I'm just asking *what else can I do besides talking to recruiters on LinkedIn to find a good match as for a less stressful in-house dev role with my 10+ years experience that pays fairly well?*",

Pretty dumb the cops forgot to Mirandarize him in the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was surprised at the story of Michelle Rosen&amp;#39;s mother supposedly getting her Tylenol after getting birth from the hospital dispensary. That story was new to me and casts the most doubt on James Lewis in my opinion. The argument that &amp;quot;no one was able to breach that security&amp;quot; is valid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think it&amp;#39;s far more likely there was Tylenol given to her by a friend or family member from a contaminated bottle given to Michelle&amp;#39;s mother and she didn&amp;#39;t take the prescribed Tylenol from the dispensary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird coincidence though... poor girl, poor mom :(&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
