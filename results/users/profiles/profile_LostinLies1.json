Wine. Chocolates. Cheeses, etc. \nSince these boxes were delivered to our business and were from Vendors we worked with we would open the boxes without thinking about it. \nAround a week before Christmas she shows up in the office and asked our receptionist for the packages we were holding for her. \nThe receptionist was new and confused.  She had no idea who this woman demanding deliveries. \nReceptionist called the new VP of marketing and he came up to get the scoop. \nThe former marketing person began raging that she had heard from her network that 3 of our vendors had sent her Christmas gifts. She called the vendors and they confirmed Christmas packages had been sent out. \nOur new VP confirmed that we had received them and we had put the food in the kitchen and the office staff had eaten the chocolate, cheese, wine. \nHoly shit. The woman lost her mind!!  She was screaming that the packages had been addressed to HER and we had opened HER mail, and that we had committed crimes.  \nThe company lawyer had to come up and explain that these were company gifts, not for individuals…and she was no longer working with us, and the vendor gifts were for the company. The cards included said stuff like “thank you for your business.,” and “to the team” etc. \nHer meltdown was spectacular.  She threatened legal action, called us an office full of thieving pigs and knocked a fake plant off the reception desk on her way out. \nIt was crazy AF. \nLike, who the fuck thinks they can go into a former employers office and demand mail??  \nWe drank a toast to her later at the office holiday party with some of the wine Asana sent. \n",

She is always very polite, and she knows I have limited time so she lets me leave cash on the table for my bill rather than stand in line at the register.  I always leave her the change (probably about 6 dollars on a 14 dollar tab.\n\nLast week I dropped off a Christmas Card for her, and I tucked 100 dollar bill in the card thanking her for her service throughout the year.  She wasn't there, so I left the sealed card with the owner.\n\nYesterday I went for lunch and my favorite waitress was there.  Soon as she saw me she smiled and thanked for my Christmas card, and the 20 dollars I gave her.\n\nI was sort of shook.  I said, \"I left you 100 dollars.\"\n\nThat's when she told me the owner has opened her card and since all tips are shared by the staff he gave everyone a share.\n\nWhen I found this out I was fucking floored.  This meant the guy had opened a sealed card that I delivered.  He took the 100 dollars out, and put 20 dollars back into her card.\n\nAs I was leaving I saw the guy coming out of the back and I asked him to speak with me.  He came over and I told him I didn't appreciate him opening something private that I had left for the waitress and that he either owed me 80 dollars, or her.\n\nHe started explaining that all tips are shared, but I cut his ass off.  You do NOT open a sealed card with someone else's name on it.  If I had known that was going to happen I would never have left it with the owner.  He told me he knew there was probably money in it and he wanted to be fair to everyone who worked for him...so I asked a guy behind the counter, \"Did you get 20 dollars from this guy?\"  The dude didn't answer, but when the owner looked away the dude shook his head very quickly.\n\nI yelled back into the kitchen, \"Hey...did any of you get 20 dollars from this guy last week?\"\n\nLots of confused looks.\n\nThe owner tried to 'comp' my tuna sandwich, then got angry at me for causing a scene.  He threatened to call the cops and told me to never return to his diner again. I left, but I told the waitress I would be back around today (noon) to give her the 80 dollars.  She insisted that she didn't want it, but I'm making sure she gets it.\n\nI have to ask...is there anything I can do here?  I feel like he literally stole from one of his employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:  Thank you for the feedback. I won't leave a shit review just because there are people who work there, and the food is good.  \nI met my waitress at lunch across the street and tried to give her 80 dollars but she told me the owner gave it back to her before she finished her shift.  What a great person.  She wouldn't take it even after I said she could have it.  \nTo the poster who said I should never have given the card to someone other than the waitress...you're spot on, mate.  Lesson learned.  \n",

    "body": "This was about 20 years ago.  \nI had taken a job with a company in Indiana.  A bunch of new people were starting the same week and we were all flown to the home office.  \nOne the first day, we were given the company rules.  One was, \"We spend money like its your mothers.\"  In other words, they're cheap.  \nOne of the managers was put in charge of about 9 new hires.  8 of us were all fairly young, but there was one woman who was probably in her 40's who had been hired as the head of sales.  \nThe manager takes us all out to this restaurant for lunch.  A burger place with a sports theme.  \nWe all ordered, the bill came, and the manager in charge of us grabbed the check.  \nThe woman in her 40's was sitting next to him.    \nWhen the manager closed the check folder, the woman stared at him in open disbelief.  After a beat she said, 'You can't be serious.\"  \nHer voice was filled with such contempt the rest of us shut up and started watching the exchange about to go down.  \nThe manager didn't understand.  \"You just left 7 dollars on a 90 dollar tab.\"  \nThe manager went into the company mandate about 'Spending money like it's your mother's.'  \nThe woman (Christ I was impressed) said, \"My mother tips 20%.\"   The manager move the tip to 10 dollars and said how it was more than he has ever tipped.  You could see he was NOT happy having this woman call him out on the first day there.  \nShe actually turned to the rest of us at the table (who were younger) and said, \"Here is a great lesson for you. Never underpay someone just to save money.  When you take people out for a meal, you must  factor the tip in.  Just because you're cheap, it doesn't give you the right to stiff someone.\"  Home girl whipped out her wallet and left another 10 on the bill.  The manager was harumpfing saying, \"It was too much.\"  \nShe turned to us again and said,  \"That woman just served a table of ten for 90 dollars.  When you tip, you have to take that into consideration.  20 dollars is the proper amount,\" totally ignoring the manager.  \nWe made it back to the office and word on what she had done spread like wild fire.  Management was so offended and angry at her for 'insulting' the manager in front new hires, but she didn't seem to give a fuck.  She left the company the next day.  \nI've looked her up on Linkedin and she is wildly successful.  \nSo, about a week ago, I was tasked with taking a young group of new engineers out for lunch.  When the check came it was 140 dollars for six of us.  The first thing I said to the newbies as I signed was, \"Always remember to tip a minimum of 20%.  Never go out for a meal in a restaurant if you can't cover an extra 20% in the tip...and remember that your server gets a bit extra if it's a large table\"  \n\n\nThat lady taught me one of the most important lessons I've ever had: Dont be afraid to call out someone who is being cheap, regardless of the company.",

When I get my bonus, I'll reimburse you guys for that and it'll be my Christmas present to you!\" I also sent them separate Christmas gifts in December.\n\n3 weeks ago we were told at work we would not be getting our bonuses. This has put my own household into a real quandary. We had plans for that bonus money. I was telling my parents about it and my stepmother interrupted me and said, \"You still have to pay us that 3,000 dollars. We've made purchases expecting that money from you and you have to give it to us our were in trouble. You were to have sent it a month ago, and I hate to bring it up now, but you have to pay us.\"\n\nI admit, I was completely floored. I had just explained how my job situation was at risk, no bonuses, and how it had fucked up my entire life.

    "body": "My Mom died Sunday night at 1:15am.  She had COPD for 10 years and we managed to keep her safe during the past year.  She even got her first vaccine 3 weeks ago and was about to get her second one when she tested positive on the 2nd.  By Friday she was in complete organ shut down.  \nI posted in a couple places here on Reddit, and I realized very quickly that people are just vicious.  The internet makes it so easy to be anonymous and say things that are just gutting.  I often wonder what kind of person direct messages someone to tell them that their dead mother is roasting in \"COVID hell\" and that they hoped she was in agony, staring me in the eyes.  \nSomeone else told me I was being dramatic about intubation...without having any idea what has happened with Mom in the past.  The person told me if she died, at least we tried and she'd never know. His own mom had been intubated twice. Man. I begged her to intubate.  The last time I guess was just the final straw for her.  8 days.  They kept trying to wean her off, and she could swallow for months.  Fuck. FUCK.    \nHow do you try to explain this to someone who is taunting you while your mom dies?  Why the fuck should I even care?  In that moment of torture it mattered.  I wanted to reach through the screen and grab this person by their lapels and scream, \"Not everyone is the same...not everyone has the same experiences!!\"    \nI mean, I cared enough to find out who the person is in real life.  It's so fucked up, their own mother has COPD and they were mocking me while my mother died.  I learned everything about this person.  Their hobbies, their friendships, where they live, what they do (not much).  I even messaged them when I was getting close...and they reported me and I was suspended for 3 days.  \nThis person is an obese fuck on a cpap machine.  Anyway.  \nIt was a good thing.  It gave me time to reflect.  \nMy Mom was an amazing human being.  She cared so much for the people in her life.  It used to torture her when I was picked on as a kid.  I remember how she couldn't watch The Karate Kid when it came out because it reminded her of when I used to get my ass kicked every day.  LOL.  Thinking about it now, makes me laugh.  \nAnyway, even though I could have doxed the fuck out of these horrible people, I thought that about that bastard's mom, suffering with COPD.  I felt pity for his mom, and I felt pity for him.    \nI went and deleted all the posts i made while in the throes of agonizing loss, damning myself for posting my trauma to begin with.  It really was my own fault.  I had no one to turn to at the moment so I thought people in COVID and grieving forums would be supportive.  \nThat's what you get for expecting strangers to care.  \nSo, it's weird.  I know who this one dude is.  I know like, everything about this person.   I could just, fuck up everything, but, why?  Because I can?    \nIt seems childish now.    \nI just hope whenever that obese person's mom passes, that she goes peacefully, and that some anonymous person doesn't throw salt in their wound.   I really do.",
