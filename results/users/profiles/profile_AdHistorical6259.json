We are currently re-factoring existing permissions and trying to re-define how they are used, but one place that I think that there can be a quick and easy win is to consolidate permissions from PSG&amp;#39;s into individual PS&amp;#39;s, and then to remove the PS&amp;#39;s and PSG&amp;#39;s altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking for some creative ways to consolidate all of the permissions held in a PSG into a singular PS.  Aside from getting this data via SOQL, consolidating it, and importing it into a new PS, any thoughts on ways to achieve this that would be more time efficient and rely less on manual data manipulation in Excel?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Back then, Salesforce talent was super rare, and everyone was getting started.  Now that there is a mature job market, OP is 100% right.  Companies invest too much money in Salesforce to be able to justify fake it til you make it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, companies can develop Jr Admins with oversight from tenured professionals.  Cutting corners on salaries is a very expensive proposition and destroys the UX.  You have called OP an asshole a bunch of times for saying things that are factually very true.  My assumption is that you likely aren&amp;#39;t very good at your job if you don&amp;#39;t understand what is being said here.  Or maybe his points are just hitting a little too close to home?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "In general, you need to be proficient using computers.  Not from a development perspective, but more from the perspective of if you don't know how to do something, you know how Google works. You need to have decent attention to detail, a general curiosity about learning independently, and good communication skills.  You also need to learn how to use the platform, which you can do independently at [https://trailhead.salesforce.com/](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/) completely for free.\n\nIn terms of positions being fully remote, it really depends on the company.  Before COVID it was pretty hard to find full time remote employment in general, during COVID it was hard to find non-remote work.  Now it feels like most companies are moving back to being in the office or the hybrid model, but there are definitely more remote positions available now than before COVID.  If this is a make or break for you, I do not believe that Salesforce Admin is a job that is specifically likely to have a higher percentage of remote jobs than average.\n\nIn terms of compensation, Salesforce Admin really depends how far you take it.  Admin range in the US is generally $80k-$120k.  If you take this a little further and layer in Business Analytics, the range increases, as does it with Product Ownership and Product Management.  There are other growth tracks that offer plenty of room for growth (development, consulting, architect) depending on what resonates most with you in Salesforce.  In general, Salesforce professionals probably cap out at around $250k per year, and that is at the very top end from what I have seen.\n\nI personally believe that the barriers to entry for Salesforce and the amount of learning/specialization required are significantly lower than for similarly paying positions in other industries.  I also believe that the barriers to entry are pretty minimal as well.  It is true that supply in the job market has recently seemingly caught up to demand, but I think that it is still a very healthy job market and one that compensates better than it should for the amount of skill that it requires.\n\n\\*All of this is based on the US job market, it can vary significantly from this in other regions.",

Not from a development perspective, but more from the perspective of if you don&amp;#39;t know how to do something, you know how Google works. You need to have decent attention to detail, a general curiosity about learning independently, and good communication skills.  You also need to learn how to use the platform, which you can do independently at &lt;a href=\"https://trailhead.salesforce.com/\"&gt;https://trailhead.salesforce.com/&lt;/a&gt; completely for free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of positions being fully remote, it really depends on the company.  Before COVID it was pretty hard to find full time remote employment in general, during COVID it was hard to find non-remote work.  Now it feels like most companies are moving back to being in the office or the hybrid model, but there are definitely more remote positions available now than before COVID.  If this is a make or break for you, I do not believe that Salesforce Admin is a job that is specifically likely to have a higher percentage of remote jobs than average.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of compensation, Salesforce Admin really depends how far you take it.  Admin range in the US is generally $80k-$120k.  If you take this a little further and layer in Business Analytics, the range increases, as does it with Product Ownership and Product Management.  There are other growth tracks that offer plenty of room for growth (development, consulting, architect) depending on what resonates most with you in Salesforce.  In general, Salesforce professionals probably cap out at around $250k per year, and that is at the very top end from what I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally believe that the barriers to entry for Salesforce and the amount of learning/specialization required are significantly lower than for similarly paying positions in other industries.  I also believe that the barriers to entry are pretty minimal as well.  It is true that supply in the job market has recently seemingly caught up to demand, but I think that it is still a very healthy job market and one that compensates better than it should for the amount of skill that it requires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*All of this is based on the US job market, it can vary significantly from this in other regions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If this is the case, they don't care about you as a person, they view you as a commodity that they are trying to maximize their return on.  If you love the work that you do an are well compensated for it, there are other companies out there that will pay you as well as your employer does but will treat you better.

I think the best way to do it is to add the Report Data in via VLOOKUP and Pivot the data showing DashboardID in Rows and MAX(LastRunDate) as your Summary.  If you don't summarize by this and just look for Dashboards that have Reports which have not been run for a certain period, you are likely to get some number of false positives for situations where the users refreshing the Dashboard do not have access to one of the underlying reports. \n\n\\*I included the Dashboard.RunningUser.IsActive field in the query as, if this Returns as false, it means that the dashboard cannot be Run as is (until someone updates the Running User), which inherently means that no one is actively using it.",

The best way that I have found to to run a SOQL on the DashboardComponent object:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SELECT Id, CustomReportId, Dashboard.Title, Dashboard.DeveloperName, &lt;a href=\"http://Dashboard.CreatedBy.Name\"&gt;Dashboard.CreatedBy.Name&lt;/a&gt;, Dashboard.CreatedById, Dashboard.CreatedDate, Dashboard.Type, Dashboard.RunningUser.IsActive &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FROM DashBoardComponent&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can then SOQL data from Report to get the Last Run Date of the Reports returned in the list above:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SELECT Id, LastRunDate&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FROM Report&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHERE Id IN (SELECT CustomReportId FROM DashBoardComponent)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should also then grab the same data from Private Reports:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SELECT Id, LastRunDate&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FROM Report&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USING SCOPE AllPrivate&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHERE Id IN (SELECT CustomReportId FROM DashBoardComponent)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can join up all of this data in Excel.  I think the best way to do it is to add the Report Data in via VLOOKUP and Pivot the data showing DashboardID in Rows and MAX(LastRunDate) as your Summary.  If you don&amp;#39;t summarize by this and just look for Dashboards that have Reports which have not been run for a certain period, you are likely to get some number of false positives for situations where the users refreshing the Dashboard do not have access to one of the underlying reports. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*I included the Dashboard.RunningUser.IsActive field in the query as, if this Returns as false, it means that the dashboard cannot be Run as is (until someone updates the Running User), which inherently means that no one is actively using it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "A few thoughts:\n\nIf you have been an Admin for a while and are not yet certified, you definitely shouldn't need a year to get your certification.  This is a credential that I have seen several people obtain without any prior exposure to Salesforce inside of 30 days.  That didn't make them great Admins, but it did make them Certified Admins.  With adequate experience, a good Admin can pass the certification without studying at all (I'm personally 5x Certified with 0x Study, just a lot of experience).  \n\n\nAs a professional, making decisions about what may or may not happen in 5 years is a crazy thought.  With 5 years more Salesforce experience, you should be chasing recruiters and job offers away, no need to move away from a job now so you don't need to get a new one in the future.  If your motivation is solely job security in the future, don't make the move.  \n\nIf more money is enticing, go get your Admin Cert, get your Sales Cloud Consultant Cert, and Get your BA Cert.  The Sales Cloud Consultant is incredibly easy to get if you know Sales Cloud (way easier than the Admin) and the BA Cert is very basic and requires very little knowledge of anything other than common sense.  Then amp up your LinkedIn with 3x Salesforce Certified and you will get plenty of recruiters reaching out.  An experienced certified Admin should be able to find work in the 90k-120k range relatively easily if they are good at what they do and can interview better than a shoe.  If you want to stay working at a College specifically for ancillary benefits, maybe it makes sense to accept lower salaries, but I would really only assume that this makes financial sense if you have benefits that get you or your family members free/discounted tuition that you are planning on using.\n\nLast thought here is that job titles can define what you do or they can define how much you get paid.  The core responsibilities of your position will definitely change a lot of your day to day, but you can always do more and use a cross-functional skillset to add value and insert yourself into projects that fall outside of your roll.  If you want something that challenges you to grow and can lead to bigger opportunities in the future, I would get out of the Admin comfort zone and get more experience in other areas as well.  The broader your knowledge of the Salesforce platform, the better you will be.  I have worked as an Admin, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Business Systems Analyst, Salesforce Manager, SFDC Product Owner, SFDC Engagement Lead, and SFDC Platform Lead.  Each of these rolls has dramatically broadened my horizons and has made my career rewarding both financially and from how much I enjoy my work.  None of that would have happened if I opted to stay in my \" comfortable salesforce admin role.\"",
