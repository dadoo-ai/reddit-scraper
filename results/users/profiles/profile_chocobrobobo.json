    "body": "I started watching TOS in July after having watched TNG. Been enjoying the show, and apart from the episode where Kirk is flirting with a 100 year old child, I haven't found anything too problematic. I think Uhura is super cute and so glad she got to be persistent representation on screen in the 60s for black people. The show was so obviously progressive in so many ways, and embodies the qualities that I really enjoy about Star Trek, mainly the idea that in the future, somehow, humanity will actually come close to extinguishing almost all hate based on minor mental and physical differences.\n\nSo then we roll around to today's episode, Metamorphosis, S2 E9. Wow, this was a doozy, so I tried poking around the internet for opinions, and I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/zhjip8/star_trek_the_original_series_examining/). That post has quite a few comments drawing attention to some important takeaways like:\n\n \\-It's an allegory for interracial relationships, in this case, interspecies. It clearly criticizes rejection of interracial relationships, and that's cool.\n\n\\-The concept of man and woman being immutable feels a little dated, and the instant conclusion that the being is \"female\" due to that concept is...flawed. But kinda expected.\n\n\\-The concept of man needing work to survive is strange, considering Cochrane has survived 150 years without it so far.\n\nBut the thing that got to me, I hadn't seen discussed. On this adventure, we have a new woman come along, Nancy, who is sick with a fatal disease if left untreated. She's presented as a bit moody to be sure, but the show repeatedly humanizes her, giving her perhaps some of the most deeply sympathetic lines, like lamenting the idea of living a life without love, and the frustration of seeing someone else who was given love so quickly, throw it away. It's frankly heart-wrenching stuff, and meanwhile Kirk and Bones are constantly trying to save her life. It's pivotal to the episode! \n\nThe Being, this \"Companion\" completely healed a man, returned his youth to him, kept him nourished and healthy past a human's natural lifespan. This is an incredibly powerful being obviously in tune with everything about a human body. So the natural logical next step is to ask the Companion to heal Nancy! Spock, get in there! They eventually do ask the Companion to do this, and the Companion apparently says that it \"can't\". Reading between the lines, one might assume that the being is lying because it is selfish, though the episode and its characters never address this.\n\nWhat's worse, however, is that eventually we see that the Companion DOES heal her, however in doing so, it merges with her and arguably completely overwrites everything that Nancy used to be. There are a couple of throwaway lines where she suggests that Nancy is still in there, but we see no evidence of this in the slightest, and this Nancy body is now forever trapped to this planet because the Companion fused to her and cannot leave.\n\nWhile this serves as an excuse to allow the inter-species relationship to continue, NO ONE addresses the HORROR that is Nancy's erasure. They do state that she was on her deathbed when the Companion merged with her, but no one pressed the issue in the slightest:\n\nCould you now unmerge that she's healthy? Does Nancy get any say in whether she's now going to live with this random space guy for the rest of her life? Why didn't you just heal Nancy before, you asshole? \n\nNothing. So we're forced to see a romance play out where presumably there's a nonconsensual party trapped inside Nancy's body, and where the Companion is not held accountable in the slightest for the death/possession of a woman.\n\nThe only mention we get is a JOKE. Bones I believe asks, what about that war on a planet that Nancy was supposed to avert? And Kirk is like, \"I'm sure we'll find a woman somewhere to end that war.\" Like Nancy was never important in the slightest, have fun with her body selfish alien. She's expendable, replaceable.\n\nWhat? WHAT? WRITER? You'll simultaneously position a woman as critical to ending wars, but at the same time feel free to discard her entirely? I just really don't understand what happened in this episode. And yeah, all the kisses delivered to Nancy's possessed body creeped me out man. I had to turn away like I was 5 again.\n\nWhat I really think should have been done is that Nancy was dead before they had any chance to ask the Companion to help her. That would've wiped this dilemma away entirely. Oh, she's already dead, so the only way I can save her is by inhabiting her entirely or something, I dunno. But this idea that the space ghost said no, then possessed her in her death throws, and then seemingly is keeping her prisoner without any choice in the matter. Just gross. I really don't understand the disconnect in the writing here, and why no one else has talked about it.\n\nAm I crazy? What do yall think?",

    "body": "Wow. About a decade ago, I played a large chunk of Dark Souls 2, with a good bit of help from a buddy. He and I had finished Dark Souls 1 together, he carried me through some of the later stages. We had a good time in Dark Souls 2, and I LOVED the tower shields.\n\nHowever, when we made it to the Shrine of Amana, we started having some trouble. The spellcasting enemies were a stick up our bums, and when I finally made it to the Frog(Demon of Song), I just kept getting killed, over and over. I don't recall exactly what was so difficult, but I have a pretty good guess, I think that my rolling was absolute trash, and the shield didn't help much. That grab he does was certainly my doom more times than not. I ultimately hung up Dark Souls 2, stuck forever on the Frog, and my friend and I moved onto other games.\n\nWell, a decade later, I hardly play with anyone anymore, and just really wanted the experience of playing with a Tower Shield again. Purchased Scholar on Steam, and started up another Tower Shield build! Things have been going great, and though I'm 31 now(almost 32), it feels like I'm somehow better than I was in my 20s. Most bosses haven't given me much trouble, and I've not wanted to summon help most of the time(in fact, I've been summoning NPCs to finish their quests, and been sad that they made fights go even quicker. RIP Congregation). \n\nTonight, I finally arrived in this beautiful area with enchanting song all around, and I gotta say, I loved the area. I'm a sucker for good music in games. Granted, it could get annoying after awhile. But I didn't need to stay here long. Mowed over all these spellcasters, laid some poison arrows into them when I didn't feel like dealing with them, and picked the place clean(making constant use of the torch to try not to slip into a chasm). \n\nThen, I arrived at the Frog. My first bout with him, I was a hairsbreadth from victory, when I got greedy. He was one hit from death, but as I bashed that R1 button, he got me in a staggered wombo combo. Guys, I can't tell you how anxious that made me. I almost beat my old nemesis in one go, but screwed it up. I was deathly afraid that I just missed my lucky break.\n\nBut then I strolled in there a second time, and I showed the fuck up. Poor frog didn't lay a hit on me. I was more aggressive than the first try. Smacking him every time he came out of his shell before he could do anything, rolling away before his hits could land, punishing his every move. It was glorious. He died poorly. Disgraced. Now I pose on his grave. \n\nTonight, I go to sleep, because it is way too late. But I will sleep well, knowing that the rest of Dark Souls 2 waits for me. And something tells me that the remaining bosses will be sleeping with one eye open.",

    "body": "Hey guys, I've searched and while part of my question has been asked before, I wanted to share my experience a bit and get some thoughts, because this morning messed me up a bit.\n\nTo preface, I smash bugs all the time, have a flycatcher setup to nab rogue house/fruit flies that find their way in, and save(take outside) jumping spiders all the time because they're good buddies but don't belong in my house. I live in an apartment that is half set in the ground, so critters seem to get in like they would in a house's basement. Not ideal.\n\nBut this past week, a mouse got in somehow. We spotted it, and I tried to see if I could catch it by hand, having identified a corner it was in. Well, for anyone who has seen a mouse run(I had not), you might guess how that turned out. It sped away almost faster than I could see it, all I registered was a streak from the corner of my eye and it was gone. So I rationalized that I needed a passive trap way of getting this thing.   \n  \nI don't have a lot of extra equipment with which to fashion a trap myself, so my choices looked like store bought options: poison, snap trap, glue trap, or live trap. I don't really like any of these options, but I decided the glue trap was ideal because I could set a lot of them cheaply, and I could decide what to do with him once I caught him. If the trap failed, he was unlikely to go through undue pain as long as I frequently checked the traps.\n\nWell, I caught him this morning, his hind end stuck in a trap close to where I originally spotted him, bingo! My dog alerted me so I think we got to him pretty soon after getting stuck. He was in one piece, and just kinda chilling. I had hoped that he would never come back, because I had set up the trap a few days ago, and hadn't seen any sign of him, so I hadn't fully committed to the reality of killing the poor beastie. So I looked up a lot of advice on reddit as to how to end him.\n\nI saw many people report simply throwing the traps away, whether a \"more humane\" live trap, or a glue trap. Starvation seems pretty cruel imo. Then I saw people propose drowning. Also seemed not great. Someone proposed feeding it poison while on/in the trap, which was just like...damn, I don't want to double down on gradual death options. I also saw something about snapping neck, but I felt like that was a bad idea for me as I'm not practiced in mouse anatomy and I really didn't like the idea of being bit in the process.\n\nThen I arrived at my chosen method, quick crush. People reported using a boot, using a brick, using a hammer, etc. The only one I have is a hammer. I considered using a normal shoe(with my foot in it), but having crushed many insects in my time, often in a tissue with my hands, I know what crushing a being feels like when your body is in direct contact, and I did not want to feel the bones of a mammal underfoot.\n\nHaving decided, I grabbed a plastic grocery bag, the only gloves I have(moving gloves), my hammer, and went to retrieve the trap. I put the now struggling mouse into the bag, and walked outside, nerves a wreck at what I was about to do. I've got a nice big parking lot, so I take him to the far side, and set down the bag on the pavement, a pretty ideal surface for this grisly task. I had already been figuring out how to keep the hammer and myself as clean as possible, so I realized hitting him through the bag was the best option to control any possible spatter. To locate him, I smoothed the bag over him, making sure I found his head, and in that moment, I felt awful. The mouse had been skittering around a bit when I picked him up and set him down, but for the journey itself, he'd been quite calm/resigned, and now that I put the bag down and smoothed it over him, I expected him to be freaking out, but he was just...calm. He was probably resigned and tired, but it messed me up because the whole interaction felt like he was trusting me, and in that moment I felt bad but still determined. Left alive, he would return and we just can't live together. Left in the dumpster in the glue trap he would die slowly.\n\nSo I raised my hammer to carryout my mercy. And then it comes down, and he moves. I don't know if he moved before I hit or after, but all I know is...I fucked up because the hammer came down and it was not quick. Feeling that any pain I had already inflicted is unacceptable, I proceeded to dole out several more thwacks until movement ceased, and after nudging him a final time to see if he reacted, nothing. \n\nI proceeded to give him a dumpster burial and now I feel like garbage myself. I previously rationalized with myself that this was the best thing I could do for both of us, and then I fucked it up. Now I'm stuck wondering, would drowning be better? Would poison be better? Would a snap trap that didn't fully work and let him bleed out be better? I put this poor mouse through a horror movie death for 10 seconds.\n\nAfter going through that, I realized that I can't be the only one, certainly someone has messed up their intentions to quickly kill an animal. In that moment I wonder if you act the same, too far in, but at the same time horrified that you have to act again. I don't really ever want to be in charge of killing another mammal man. God forbid more mice start showing up now...",

I don't know if religion should necessarily be seen as counter to those ideas, though I get that religion has not been without harm.\n\nThe worry that much of media is placating some vocal bad actors in our society recently is a real one though. Honestly this isn't particularly new. Of course at the end of the day, most shows are about making money. I think it's wise for you to vote with your wallet if these brands are making you feel disrespected, so I won't judge you at all for it.",

I don&amp;#39;t know if religion should necessarily be seen as counter to those ideas, though I get that religion has not been without harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worry that much of media is placating some vocal bad actors in our society recently is a real one though. Honestly this isn&amp;#39;t particularly new. Of course at the end of the day, most shows are about making money. I think it&amp;#39;s wise for you to vote with your wallet if these brands are making you feel disrespected, so I won&amp;#39;t judge you at all for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "Jokes aside, I also am not talking about the gameplay or lore reasons he's hard. But more of the design decision.\n\nWhen I played FFX as a kid, I enjoyed it a lot. Blitzball as a minigame within the game was revolutionary to me, and I loved the characters and their journey. However, our journey together ended at Mt.Gagazet. That tough fight that many of us know well, with the wicked weaponization of zombie and cure spells. As a new player, zombie hadn't been a concern all game,(and I didn't notice the Via Purifico dragon being a zombie), so I was completely blindsided and hit a wall. The cutscene to try again back in the early 2000s was brutal for a kid in school with siblings and 1 tv. I had a couple of game sessions wasted before I just gave up and never played X again.\n\nImagine my surprise this year when I played the game to the end. The scene of the summoners of Zanarkand right after Seymour is utterly haunting.\n\nAnd this is where I begin my theory. Seymour is hard there to limit the number of kids that saw this hard-core twist. When I saw X in a games case at the supermarket, I asked if I could get it. My mom said something to the effect of \"Isn't that the atheist game?\" I looked at her like she was crazy, and ended up with the game that looked cool. What a ride it was. FFX actually depicts Yevon in a pretty beautiful way, and even after completing it, I feel like the story doesn't damn faith or religion in their entirety. But the twist of the summoners is a pretty gnarly visual to attribute to religion, much more so than the idea of religious leaders being corrupt(which any thoughtful religious person has to grapple with). It's like Seymour is guarding some of this really heavy material. It's not until after this and the fight with Yunalesca that you really turn into a God-killer.\n\nWith all this buried so deep in the game, it feels like an engineered defense to your game just getting flagrantly blasted by big religious types, and keeping the Teen rated game accessible to more kids. You aren't gonna get to the core atheist theming without being pretty invested in the game, and without being somewhat smart. At that point of investment, you're less likely to be the type of person that goes around telling people how \"evil\" the message is.\n\nWhat do you guys think? It definitely could all be coincidental, but it's interesting to consider them constructing guardrails in this way.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqoo56mrk59e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ba832a143cbfb94ff09ca03f3d5bf822beb3aa\n\n",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, I also am not talking about the gameplay or lore reasons he&amp;#39;s hard. But more of the design decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I played FFX as a kid, I enjoyed it a lot. Blitzball as a minigame within the game was revolutionary to me, and I loved the characters and their journey. However, our journey together ended at Mt.Gagazet. That tough fight that many of us know well, with the wicked weaponization of zombie and cure spells. As a new player, zombie hadn&amp;#39;t been a concern all game,(and I didn&amp;#39;t notice the Via Purifico dragon being a zombie), so I was completely blindsided and hit a wall. The cutscene to try again back in the early 2000s was brutal for a kid in school with siblings and 1 tv. I had a couple of game sessions wasted before I just gave up and never played X again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise this year when I played the game to the end. The scene of the summoners of Zanarkand right after Seymour is utterly haunting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this is where I begin my theory. Seymour is hard there to limit the number of kids that saw this hard-core twist. When I saw X in a games case at the supermarket, I asked if I could get it.

And upon seeing the way it's setup, I realized immediately why it drives people crazy. Not because it's difficult, but there are definitely runs that are impossibly stacked against you, regardless of skill. And you have to play through those. I can see how someone who doesn't recognize this would beat themselves up about it. As it was, each time I started, I evaluated my chances, and so I was less disappointed each time I lost. There were certainly a few where I knew I had an opportunity, and my hopes were dashed, but for the most part, most races I knew were unwinnable and tried to just not be upset. I also set a limit of time for how long I would try. With gambling, if you don't set limits, you'll hurt yourself.\n\nSo, why is it gambling? The game heavily relies on you getting enough balloons and avoiding enough birds. You cannot win without getting a high number of balloons, say at least 12, if you somehow can hit the finish line with no birds and 35 seconds time. However, balloon placement is random, and the first downhill portion is necessary if you want to stand a chance. If balloons spawn on the left, you will miss most or all of that initial batch. So you can easily tell if the odds are stacked against you from the start. Other issues exist, like balloons being stacked side by side means you can only get 1.\n\nAdding on to the random quality of the game is the control of the chocobo itself. It'll tug randomly, causing a bird dodge to turn into a bird hit. No, it's not just the invisible walls that are an issue. \n\nThen you have to worry about the position of your opponent, and the fact that they consume balloons. You can try to take cover behind them, but you lose balloons that way, and you can never tell if they will successfully dodge. If they're behind you, you can never tell where their birds will be targeting, so you might end up running right into their birds.\n\nOverall, there are so many random and uncontrollable factors that regardless of skill, you just have to get the correct balloon spawn, and you have to hope that opponent racer doesn't plot against you. Seems like pretty bad game design.\n\nBuuuut, sometimes when you gamble you win. However, the fact that there's a skill advantage here makes it more akin to poker than a slot machine. Good luck to everyone who has yet to try this, or intends to try in the future! Also, remember your time is probably more valuable spent doing something else, so cap yourself. You might never get it.",

The main reason I ask is that I'm a bit afraid of really exploring the Sphere Grid. It's cool that you can go back and forth, any retracing allows you to expend 1 point for 4 nodes. I've been doing a good bit of back and forth with kimarhi. I went and grabbed dark strike because wakka was running out of MP, and now I've dipped into Lulu's tree so I have a second basic dark mage. Finally I'm returning to Kimarhi's tree, and meanwhile he's lagging behind everyone stat wise. Partly because I've focused more abilities, but also because I've kept his AP rate consistent with everyone else. So it seems like the system punishes you for using SP to dart around. Is this generally how people understand it? Don't go back and forth without really good reason? It just feels so punishing to lose several levels just backtracking.",

The story hit so hard for me as a young teen that just wanted to be nice to everyone and find a beautiful girl. As many teens, I had to fight for PS2 time and so when I finally reached what was an unbeatable boss for me on the snow peak, I ended my beautiful run on the game. I later became aware that SPOILERS our brave hero makes an ultimate sacrifice.\n\nSo then the existence of X-2 surprised me, but I saw it starred Yuna, which was enough to encourage me to buy it. Unfortunately pretty early on it seemed evident that Yuna almost entirely moved on from Tidus and the old crew, taking only Rikku and leaving the emotional core of X behind. It felt less like a sequel and more like a fan fiction that was thoroughly divorced from the mood of FFX.\n\nSo then I ask, for those of you who have played X-2, how did you do it? Does it at some point redeem the fact that it seems to almost entirely ignore the first game? Does it find an emotional core at some point and tell a worthwhile story? Or is it just a lighthearted, horny spinoff that still feels out of place?\n\nEdit: It's pretty awesome to see so many folks respond to this. I haven't started replaying either title yet(just about to start X today). So my working knowledge seems to be a little off, but if my rose tinted goggles are enough to get me to play X, they were enough to discourage me from X-2, so I wanted some input. Seems like a lot of you really enjoyed the sequel and also justify it as a story embracing Yuna's growth past indoctrination. Also the idea that the world is more upbeat because of the termination of Sin, makes sense to me. I guess as a teen I was just thrown off because it didn't seem like the same world, but that's kinda the point right? It is, but it isn't. Also good to know that some of the characters from the original do get revisited, even if it's not as much as I'd like. Thanks for the input yall, I think I'll give X-2 another try this go around.",

It seems that they play home games for half the weekends of the entire warm season in Ohio, which is kinda ridiculous if that means this area is baseball territory for that entire time. \n\nI'm not a baseball fan in the slightest, and I hear they're having a pretty poor season, so it's even more striking that the entire region caters to people going to see the game and excludes everyone else.\n\nIt just feels like the solution is to check whether the Reds are playing this weekend, and if not then maybe you can hit the Riverfront. If they are though, avoid like the plague. Super annoying to have to regularly check a schedule for a whole strip of the city.",

We ended up just turning back and going home, which was a bit frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you that like to visit this area, what do you do during Reds season? It seems that they play home games for half the weekends of the entire warm season in Ohio, which is kinda ridiculous if that means this area is baseball territory for that entire time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a baseball fan in the slightest, and I hear they&amp;#39;re having a pretty poor season, so it&amp;#39;s even more striking that the entire region caters to people going to see the game and excludes everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just feels like the solution is to check whether the Reds are playing this weekend, and if not then maybe you can hit the Riverfront. If they are though, avoid like the plague. Super annoying to have to regularly check a schedule for a whole strip of the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "There are certainly a lot of tropes that get repeated, like the god-beings, just in slightly different ways. It does get pretty tiring when you have access to the whole show and watch episodes one after the other. But I give it a lot of slack because I'm not watching the way they did back in 1960s. I like the concept still, and actually Trelayne was a lot of fun. I kinda liked him...more than Q? If that's allowed? I immediately ended that episode and went searching to figure out if he was a Q lol, and the answer is...maybe? That sort of thing felt more interesting, building a mythology, rather than the repeated new god beings. I feel like TOS, at least season 1 really suffered from so many episodes focused on that trope. But I suppose many alien things must have seemed extraordinary back then, so not unreasonable to assume they're all more powerful than us.\n\nThe one episode with Klingons so far also had the Organians! It was funny to see this blackface Mongolian version of the Klingons and then have them cucked by the Organians.\n\nAs far as Carol Marcus is concerned, I'm not up to her yet in TOS, and I barely remember her from the movie, except uh...the scene which overtly sexualized her changing lol. Granted it's been like what, 15 years since I watched that.\n\nBut yeah, what you described sounds pretty bad. I know in TOS, Kirk definitely starts getting more goofy, but so far, as you described, he's pretty good most of the time. Though I feel like there's been a couple scenes where he lays a smooch on a girl who didn't exactly ask for it. As I said before though, all the girls end up reciprocating. People will argue that that sort of thing is bad, to which I have no real answer, because women sometimes confuse me. \"We like a man of action that chooses for us!\" Yes, I somehow have a wife anyway. Women still confound me. Don't think I'll ever solve them.\n\nDo you think Kirk gets more kissy/floozy in season 3 maybe? Or maybe Animated Series? If it all really came from those books, that really stinks. I always look at books like that as extra material for people to enjoy, but not really critical. Like all the Star Wars novels.",

Ideally I'm looking for games where you feel big. It could be for a pivotal moment of the game, where story builds up to you being super powerful, like in Metal Gear Solid 4 and you get to control Metal Gear Rex. But ideally it's a core gameplay element. Games that I'd say really satisfy this request for me are things like The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, or Twisted Metal games, where you could play as a big truck and slam into smaller vehicles, really feeling that impact. Nothing beat Twisted Metal 2 and ramming a car in the side to see them flip and take massive damage. War of Monsters did a great job when you land a really solid hit and your opponent goes flying across the map.\n\nIdeally there's not a huge barrier to feeling strong. Fighting games, you can definitely land an impressive string of hits and feel strong, but that takes a lot of effort, and many people aren't good at fighting games, me included. I'd want something where a 7 year old could pick it up and feel the adrenaline of being a badass. Note: I am not coincidentally 7, just trying to replicate that 7 year old feeling when I played Mr Slam in Twisted Metal 2.\n\nBesides the ones I mentioned, I'd say God of War series does a great job, and Asura's Wrath notched it up to 11. There are demolition derby games, but none that really make me feel that oomph, if you know what I mean. So many games have you play powerful characters but the game execution makes them feel weak, so I'm really looking for something that feels really tactile.",

I love her and she loves me. She's had her mind made up to marry me for several years, but I haven't.\n\nIt's hard for me to put a finger on it, I think she's a very nice girl, very pretty. She's often upset or stressed, and can snap at the drop of a hat. She's also messy and critical. At the same time, when she's in a good mood, she's a delight. She giggles a lot, goes along with my lame jokes, and even sometimes cleans up a bit and cooks.\n\nShe said she has life goals and wants to be true to herself, which I agreed. She told me she wants to have kids before she's 30, because that's the biological cutoff. She also said she wanted to be engaged by year 4 of our relationship, if we get engaged. Obviously this was a bit of a cutoff point. \n\nAt 4 years though, I did not propose. I realized I missed her mark, but she stayed with me. She tried to not bring it up and give me grace. We scheduled a vacation to Disney at about 4.5 years. I planned to propose, but never got a ring and chickened out. I didn't feel like I was 100% committed to it, and felt it would be wrong to propose to buy time.\n\nNow, I left for a trip and we have been having discussions about me being indecisive. I know she has a countdown, I know I've been unable to meet it, I keep telling her I care about her, but I can't make up my mind. It's painful because I know we could probably be happy together, but things always pull me out. I don't know what is holding me back, if it's a me problem or a relationship problem.\n\nAny advice on my situation or stories about how you decided to propose/accept a proposal even if you had some reservations would be helpful and appreciated.

I was hoping to get some general feedback, to see if anyone really has seen an atrocious effect from hdt hairs and if they could tell me what to steer clear of. \n\nAs I understand it, HDT is basically a physics model that utilizes and activates certain bones in a mesh. In the case of hair, a modder would have added a few bones and weights to their hair mesh, and then the HDT physics system waves it around in game. Doesn't seem like that'd be too taxing on the system unless maybe hairs on average contain a lot more bones than other meshes that utilize hdt. Or if a lot of npcs utilize the HDT hair.\n\nNow for my personal use, I have CBPC installed, but not really HDT, though I have a SMP toggle that I never turn on. I'd only be putting a hdt hair on my PC. I think CBPC actually enables HDT hairs to work okay, swaying around and whatnot, and I have this installed already.

However, there do appear to be some hairs in certain non HDT hair packs that are slightly affected by movement. How this works, I have no idea. But for truly HDT hairs, you NEED HDT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

There's a fun factor to this scenario, but at the same time now I'm less challenged by my enemies, and I've also skipped over a few tiers of armor.

    "body": "So I know this reddit sees Hella traffic, I debated posting here. But in the end this will be good for me to document somewhere to speak to a counselor later, because I have the memory of a house fly.\n\nA good chunk of context first, and second I'll be wondering whether I have my situation figured correctly, if you can provide feedback I'd be appreciated.\n\nSo I've been dating my girlfriend for 4 years, this is a long time to go without a proposal for a man my age. However, this is my first relationship that has lasted more than a month. I turned in my V-card with this woman about 2-3 months in. We have had fights ever since 4 months in, have taken 2-4 day breaks a few times, and have lived together now for a little over 3 years. We moved in together out of being comfortable with each other and because rent is too damn high.\n\nThe big thing is, she's very negative.If you have any theoretical situation about people, her answer is always, I don't care, kill em all, unless it's my Mom. She's even proposed the possibility that a genocide would solve some of our problems, a la Thanos' method from the Avenger films.\n\nIt'd be fine if it was just jokes, but when I try to actually talk about situations from another person's perspective, describe how Action A will affect Person B, her response is always selfish, and she finds the exercise of empathy as pointless.\n\nMe personally, when she talks to me about that stuff, my unborn children start retreating into my genetic code. I love this girl and often think about our children, but worry that they won't understand basic human empathy due to their mother. I mean, I'm the least empathetic of my siblings, and this is still a concern to me.\n\nSo, this past year, I've been seriously thinking about engagement. It's been as long as it has, and I need to make a next step. Problem is, I keep stutter stepping. We have another fight, another discussion, her attitudes remain negative. Several times she's said she doesn't want kids because the world is mucked up, it would take a toll on her body, and she often says she'd rather live alone. And yet, she still wants to marry me, talk about mixed signals!\n\nThe past few months, I noticed I've been sour while at work, my manager noticed this, and asked me to improve my relationships with my coworkers, because no one wanted to work with me. I quickly identified that I was a sour POS, and have since started trying to better myself by being more friendly with my coworkers and trying to have generally more positive/caring interactions with these people who are in my life everyday.\n\nThis includes my gf, who I have paid more attention to than normal. As a layer of this, I've been trying to be more positive in discussions with her, including telling her gently when she hurts my feelings.\n\nYesterday, I was talking to my gf about my job. I had an interview for a promotion that day, and I'd asked my manager for a higher raise because I felt the position I'd been in and was being promoted to was undervalued. I do Admin work and consulting for Salesforce, and my position started at 40K. And the promotion makes I think 45K, while doing double the work. For a tech job, this is very low. That said, it's the best paying job I have, but I felt justified asking for the upgrade because I'm part of a 3 man team that just had our responsibilities doubled last year without seeing a penny.\n\nAnyway, I'm sometimes late for work. I've always been bad at being on time, I'll wake up late, struggle to put myself together, and be 5,10, sometimes 14 minutes late. I was just late that morning before asking for the raise. Now, I don't think this is a huge deal, and management never seems too annoyed either. I often stay late, even if I came in on time. That few minute delay in the morning really isn't that big of a deal because I do a really good job while I'm there.\n\nAnyway, I expected my girlfriend to be all nods and encouragement,  \"go get that money!\" Instead, she started saying things like, \"If I was your manager, I'd freak out. You're all not doing your jobs, and you're asking for a raise. Just do your job, and show up on time.\" Double surprise, one she's not supporting me, and two she's suddenly empathetic to the slave driver rather than the slaves. One of the few times I've seen her in anybody else's shoes.\n\nWell, I basically shut up about it, until tonight, we started talking about it again, because someone at her job is abusing WFH policies, and she's afraid management will restrict WFH privileges. She started drawing parallels to me being late from work and saying how bad that was. At my job, it's not a huge deal.\n\nI still felt rough about her comments the night prior, so I mentioned \"Hey, what you were saying about me yesterday made me pretty upset, like you ignored how much I put into my job and don't think I deserved a raise because you find my being late to be a big issue, as if I have no real value.\"\n\nShe snarls, \"Yeah I bet you didn't like that!\"\n\nI retorted, \"What do you mean I bet you didn't like that? I'm trying to talk to you about these things and be open because you're my partner, I don't really feel safe if you're going to be this dismissive.\"\n\nShe laughed incredulously, and said \"You feel physically unsafe?\"\n\nI said, \"No, I feel emotionally...\"\n\nShe cut me off and told me to stop talking and take her home. We were out getting food.\n\nWhen we returned home after a silent 10 minute drive, she slammed the door, and walked inside without me, she hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nWe had a similar occurrence a few weeks ago where I told her \"What you said hurt my feelings, could you please not say things like that\" and she never apologized. I'm convinced she doesn't think she did anything wrong this time either.\n\nNow, am I being an ass, by trying to be more clear cut when I feel she's being unfair or destructive? I'm hoping that by being more clear, she can understand when I'm hurt, rather than me lashing out.\n\nAnd the bigger question, moments like these are what make me stutter on my way to the wedding. I don't like to quit, and we've invested 4 years in each other. She usually backs me up, but she also is just brimming with negative outlooks. I just wish I could have her manager say something that would allow her to decide to try positivity for a change.\n\nI dunno, what do you guys think, am I a jerk, is she wrong for me, should I just shut up because this is how every relationship is?",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I know this reddit sees Hella traffic, I debated posting here. But in the end this will be good for me to document somewhere to speak to a counselor later, because I have the memory of a house fly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good chunk of context first, and second I&amp;#39;ll be wondering whether I have my situation figured correctly, if you can provide feedback I&amp;#39;d be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been dating my girlfriend for 4 years, this is a long time to go without a proposal for a man my age. However, this is my first relationship that has lasted more than a month. I turned in my V-card with this woman about 2-3 months in. We have had fights ever since 4 months in, have taken 2-4 day breaks a few times, and have lived together now for a little over 3 years. We moved in together out of being comfortable with each other and because rent is too damn high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big thing is, she&amp;#39;s very negative.If you have any theoretical situation about people, her answer is always, I don&amp;#39;t care, kill em all, unless it&amp;#39;s my Mom. She&amp;#39;s even proposed the possibility that a genocide would solve some of our problems, a la Thanos&amp;#39; method from the Avenger films.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;d be fine if it was just jokes, but when I try to actually talk about situations from another person&amp;#39;s perspective, describe how Action A will affect Person B, her response is always selfish, and she finds the exercise of empathy as pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me personally, when she talks to me about that stuff, my unborn children start retreating into my genetic code. I love this girl and often think about our children, but worry that they won&amp;#39;t understand basic human empathy due to their mother. I mean, I&amp;#39;m the least empathetic of my siblings, and this is still a concern to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, this past year, I&amp;#39;ve been seriously thinking about engagement.

She definitely has a stuck up attitude and can be very proud in the episode, blaming the Federations doctors for not giving immunizing her to the rare disease she somehow contracted(in future space, probably 1 million vaccines you could take, eh?).\n\nI am in fact analyzing this today, but even in 1967, stories were capable of humanizing all kinds of characters. Typically TOS kills off characters in ways you expect, and they're reacted to in kind. Even so, Kirk often laments his random crewmembers dying on his watch, and there's a whole episode about Spock not valuing the lives of his men(all of whom are brand new to the episode and impressively inept and fragile). What I highlight as so shocking about Nancy's humanity being robbed, and the crew's relative indifference, is really informed by the way the rest of the series is written and presented. It sticks out. Maybe it stuck out less in 1967, but a movie made in 2025 often has plot holes and inconsistent writing too. What makes TOS unique is that many episodes surprise you by covering so many plot holes, and making thoughtful points out of unique situations.\n\nTo be clear here though, I'm not trying to fully condemn the episode or TOS, just wanted to share my experience and the negative feelings this part of the episode called forth. I think it's valid if you think her character was such a flaming bitch that she deserved to get overwritten, but I really didn't feel that way. She was at worst mildly annoying, which I excused because SHE WAS DYING of preventable and curable causes. I'd be a bitch too in that scenario. More than she was, certainly.",

In these cases, I've been generating the non 3BBB versions, my thought process being that I might be saving some performance.\n\nMy question is twofold, one why even have 3BBB on a full suit of armor? And two, am I actually saving a tiny bit of performance/hdd storage doing this?",

It is customer service oriented in a way that's similar to tech support. You're not speaking face to face all day but all of your work will be customer focused.\n\nWe're working remote right now, but that may change. Our office was and probably will be in Downtown Columbus.\n\nKnowing how to use Salesforce is a huge plus, but if you don't, being good with tech is what you'll need. Coding experience helps, if you're either familiar with html or basic coding logic. If you're comfortable with If, Then statements in code, you're gonna have a great start.\n\nSince we are doing work for customers, you also need to be at least somewhat sociable, but the majority of communication is via email(trying to shift toward phone more).\n\nIf you're interested, please apply using the link above! My manager is looking to hire soon and hasn't received the volume he's looking for, so this position will actually LOOK at your resume. Good luck and thanks for reading!",
