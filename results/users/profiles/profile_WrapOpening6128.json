    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of yoga, which I love, and have tried sound bath twice. I found it … erm ok, relaxing. No more than I would just relaxing eyes closed and listening to music. Other people were talking like it was some crazy out of body experience, but not me or my friend.\nAnd I do 90 min Yin yoga classes, so I’m no stranger to breathing/meditation.
