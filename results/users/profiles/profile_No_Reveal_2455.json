This is the one I use most.  Has about 500 hours on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Kohler Perkins 12.5kw (Perkins 4.108 diesel) - 40 years old. This is in an RV. It runs great, uses like .6 gallons of diesel per hour at 5kw load, but it is loud even though it is 1800rpm! Has about 2000 hours on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Predator 4000/3200 - This one is maybe 12 years old, but ran for over a week straight during Sandy with no issues. Has a 212cc Predator engine. Its just a standard generator, nothing special, but it has been reliable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hepvy1ypfmsd1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8bb17670e05547b200c0a78fb7c86030af008265\"&gt;Picture of the Kohler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
