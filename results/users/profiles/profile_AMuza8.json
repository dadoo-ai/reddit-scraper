Then you put this in Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who is going to build it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, regardless who is building. Ask stakeholders for the simplest business process and implement it. In this way you won&amp;#39;t make too much damage before you find a Salesforce Expert who can build it in a correct way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the most simple solution built you will assess the party that builds the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you will need help, I&amp;#39;m open for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. of course there is a process of importing your data into Salesforce. I would do it BEFORE implementing business processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And one more time, I can't swing it nice because I'm exhausted at the end of a tournament (we play like for 3-4 hours straight; we play matches in groups of 4-5 players, then SF with a player from another group and then Finals).\n\nI have two problems:\n\n1. strength/endurance to swing 360g for 3-4 hours consistently\n2. concentration after 3rd hour\n\nI tried to do exercise to add some more endurance to be able to swing consistently for 3-4 hours straight. I improved. But I still can't make it till the end of a tournament. I know that my opponents are exhausted too. But usually those are pushers and they can run for 2-3 more hours without any consistency loss :-)\n\nAs for concentration. I hope a bigger head size might help to mitigate concentration loss. I don't mishit a lot, but still the % is higher after 3 hours of playing.\n\nI'm 180cm and 80kg. I don't have wrist or elbow problems. I tried lighter racqets (like lighter than 315g unstrung) and they are... I just don't feel comfortable with them. I feel like I need to put more effort to hit a ball.\n\nPlease suggest any brand.

If itis demonstrated that the receiver is not ready, the service cannot be called a fault.\n\nI was playing a match. I was ready to serve but an opponent went to their towel and spent some time wiping their body. I'm standing and ready to serve. I clearly see that player is not ready to receive a serve and if I serve they even won't notice it. The towel is in the back fence in the middle of a court.\n\nIt is fine if a player finished a point in a deuce side and while going to receive a serve to the ad side come to the back fence, wipe and go straight to receive a serve. But a lot of times it was deuce end of point, towel, receiving in deuce.\n\nI'm playing amateur tournament without an umpire. There was a supervisor that told me that using a towel for a receiver is ok, like they don't break my pace (which the opponent did in my opinion) or deliberetly slow the game down (which I think the opponent did to try to restore their breath).\n\nWhat is acceptable time for a returner to walk around between points and not being ready to receive a serve?",
