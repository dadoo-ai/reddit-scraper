I stand by everything I've said, and I did actually read some of the paper and look at the journal's website before concluding it is a pile of shit.\n\nI'm suggesting ChatGPT for those who are not researchers. You can criticize however you like, but for anyone who does not have a career in science it can be helpful. I'm specifically suggesting copying and pasting the article into ChatGPT and asking it to summarize it and comment on any biases or flaws in methodology, etc. These are not things that most people know how to identify, and chatbots can make learning easier.\n\nI'm not going to argue with you about the length of the study. I don't know what field you're in that you do research, but in science we do not publish 85 page papers period. This is incoherent rambling mixed with poorly justified claims with no statistical analysis. There is no point in believing anything written in this paper solely for the reason that there is no statistical analyses or even a hypothesis! That shows a complete lack of understanding of how science works. This is not worth your time.\n\nIt is wrong to inject personal beliefs or bias into a scientific paper. I don't know if you're serious or not so I won't go into that any further.\n\nYou mention cell culture..

You can criticize however you like, but for anyone who does not have a career in science it can be helpful. I&amp;#39;m specifically suggesting copying and pasting the article into ChatGPT and asking it to summarize it and comment on any biases or flaws in methodology, etc. These are not things that most people know how to identify, and chatbots can make learning easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to argue with you about the length of the study. I don&amp;#39;t know what field you&amp;#39;re in that you do research, but in science we do not publish 85 page papers period. This is incoherent rambling mixed with poorly justified claims with no statistical analysis.

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish the people reporting on this study would actually read the methods section because it&amp;#39;s even worse than I realized. They took blood and semen samples from both non-vaccinated and vaccinated people and dripped vaccine onto dishes of each... They also claim that they determined cytotoxicity from this experiment.. Usually when you want to study cytotoxicity you take a model cell line you can grow in a lab and do microscopy or PCR assays to measure the response to whatever you&amp;#39;re testing on a cellular level. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here they got some blood and semen and subjected it to multiple freeze thaw cycles in between imaging. Surely we can all see at least one but hopefully many problems with this&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

A big challenge in getting research published is performing a good enough statistical analysis to either prove or disprove your hypothesis.
