He himself admits he's battled her and been hit by her spell before. He was there when she arrived with the Party of Heroes and the demons were forced to retreat. He knows she \"contributed considerably to humankind's understanding of Zooltrak.\" He admits she killed more demons than anyone else in history. She's apparently one of the \"geniuses\" he despises.  Yet he didn't recognize her as soon as he saw her? O.o  \n\nETA: It's right in the manga too, people. Lugner SAW Frieren and fought her. There's simply no way he wouldn't have recognized her. Scroll down toward the bottom for a pic similar to the scene in the anime...LINK: https://frieren.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_17",

I don&amp;#39;t understand why Lügner didn&amp;#39;t or couldn&amp;#39;t immediately recognize Frieren when they meet in Graf&amp;#39;s town. He himself admits he&amp;#39;s battled her and been hit by her spell before. He was there when she arrived with the Party of Heroes and the demons were forced to retreat. He knows she &amp;quot;contributed considerably to humankind&amp;#39;s understanding of Zooltrak.&amp;quot; He admits she killed more demons than anyone else in history. She&amp;#39;s apparently one of the &amp;quot;geniuses&amp;quot; he despises.  Yet he didn&amp;#39;t recognize her as soon as he saw her? O.o  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: It&amp;#39;s right in the manga too, people. Lugner SAW Frieren and fought her. There&amp;#39;s simply no way he wouldn&amp;#39;t have recognized her.

How upgraded are your end-point and in-between cities?\n\n\\#2. Crates.   \nA) The FAQ says you have an equal probability of finding parts in crates, but I question this.  Level 16 here. I opened 100 crates over the weekend and ended up with 68 Steamer parts. The rest were random Express, Standard and Zephyr parts. And even for those, the less-fuel-efficient train parts seemed to be far more common. Was that just really bad luck or are Steamers actually more abundant just to get you to spend real $$ on the game? lol  \nB) What's your crate opening strategy, especially for Special Crates? This is more out of curiosity. Do you open them as you go or wait until you've hoarded a bunch to unpack them?",

Cargo at stations.&lt;br/&gt;\nA) Does increasing the &amp;quot;stockyard capacity&amp;quot; at a station also increase the number of new regular cargo going out?&lt;br/&gt;\nB) For those of you who&amp;#39;ve been playing for years, is it possible to have ALL stations open and not struggle to get profitable jobs that work with the series of RRs you&amp;#39;ve built?  How upgraded are your end-point and in-between cities?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;#2. Crates.&lt;br/&gt;\nA) The FAQ says you have an equal probability of finding parts in crates, but I question this.  Level 16 here. I opened 100 crates over the weekend and ended up with 68 Steamer parts. The rest were random Express, Standard and Zephyr parts. And even for those, the less-fuel-efficient train parts seemed to be far more common. Was that just really bad luck or are Steamers actually more abundant just to get you to spend real $$ on the game? lol&lt;br/&gt;\nB) What&amp;#39;s your crate opening strategy, especially for Special Crates? This is more out of curiosity. Do you open them as you go or wait until you&amp;#39;ve hoarded a bunch to unpack them?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
