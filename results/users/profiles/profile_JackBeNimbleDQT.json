    "body": "Loving the tactical challenge of Arena? Wondering what units the top players are utilizing? You've come to the right place!\n\nAs I did last week, I'm going to list out the units I saw most frequently (at least 5 times) in my 80 point fights. This week, that was exactly 100 teams. Now the game has something north of 26,000 players so is this data anywhere near representative? Absolutely not. Is this list likely to replicate the experience of alot of players. No way. Am I going to use this list to extrapolate broad trends about the game and make sweeping generalizations about the meta anyway? You bet your ass.\n\nI'll also list out the units used by the Top 20 finishers this week. This data may be a little more interesting, particularly as you can use it to discern the general strategies used by the top players and work towards emulating that if you're trying to crack into the top 20. Also new this week - AWARDS!\n\nAnyway, here's what I saw for all my Hard tier opponents:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|*Unit*|*Appearances*|\n|:-|:-|\n|Wight King|63|\n|Zoma|53|\n|Dragonlord|38|\n|Killer Machine|35|\n|Dragonlord's True Form|21|\n|Hellion|19|\n|Pickled Slime|16|\n|Angel Slime|14|\n|Bone Baron|14|\n|King Bubble Slime|14|\n|Emperor Slime|13|\n|Slionheart|13|\n|Armful|12|\n|Moosifer|12|\n|Green Dragon|10|\n|Royal Reptile|8|\n|Umbra|7|\n|Stark Raven|6|\n|Archdemon|5|\n|Boreal Serpent|5|\n|Hybird|5|\n\nThe top 5 units are the exact same as last week, with Dragonlord taking 3rd from KM. Baramos is the only U (??? - 65 weight) unit that dropped out of the list altogether. Pickled Slime and RR went up slightly in usage, bug Hell Gladiator dropped and just barely missed the cut (4 appearances). Still seeing alot of the fully awakened free A units. With the light weight week, there was a shift in the number of S units used - from 33.33% of the total to 25.94%. That percentage was made up, not by A units as you might expect (down! from 32.34% to 32.09%) but rather by F units (from 0.99% to 4.55%). All hail Stark Raven.\n\nThe average level of units in Hard was 92.80 and the average awakening level was 2.23.\n\n Given these units (and the ones that showed up less than 5 times I'm including here as well), the best damage types, in order are: \n\n1. Sizz (174)\n2. Zap (149)\n3. Frizz (138)\n4. Woosh (130)\n5. Crack (115)\n6. Bang (107)\n7. Zam (61)\n\nAnd now, the meta for the **Top 20**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|*Unit*|*Appearances*|\n|:-|:-|\n|Zoma|17|\n|Wight King|13|\n|Boreal Serpent|11|\n|Dragonlord's True Form|9|\n|Bone Baron|7|\n|Dragonlord|5|\n|Ghost|5|\n|Hellion|5|\n|Killing Machine|5|\n|Devilmoth|2|\n|Draguar|2|\n|Moosifer|2|\n|Baramos|1|\n|Buffalo Wing|1|\n|Bunicorn|1|\n|Cosmic Chimaera|1|\n|Drackmage|1|\n|Dracky|1|\n|Ewwnicorn|1|\n|Fightgeist|1|\n|Green Dragon|1|\n|Imp|1|\n|Knight Errant|1|\n|Royal Reptile|1|\n|Seaslime|1|\n|Slionheart|1|\n|Stark Raven|1|\n\nNo surprise that Zoma keeps it's stranglehold on the top spot. And of course he pairs really well with WK, the two have each other's back in Arena. Fewer ghosts than last week, but as you can see from the bottom of the list, a whole bunch of random filler on the teams. Speaking of team comps, here are the rarity comps of the top 20 for this 220 weight week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|*Rarity Composition*|*Count*|\n|:-|:-|\n|USAAA|6|\n|UUSAF|6|\n|USSAC|3|\n|UUSA|2|\n|USSAF|1|\n|UUUCF|1|\n|UUUDE|1|\n\nThere were a few particular teams in the Top 20 that impressed me, so congrats, you get super special awards!\n\n* The 'Mrs. Frizzle's Magic School Bus' award goes to Master, who ran a team of Dragonlord, Cosmic Chimaera, Hellion, Green Dragon, and a Wight King with Frizzle learned.\n* The 'This isn't even my final form' award goes to Nibb Fan, the all-too-obvious alt account for Nibb\n* And finally the 'Addicted to Crack' award goes to Nightblade, who taught his Slionheart Blizzard Rush, his WK Crackle, and his Fightgest Crack.\n\nCheers everyone! Good luck beating Umaro's beast team this week!",

All hail Stark Raven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The average level of units in Hard was 92.80 and the average awakening level was 2.23.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given these units (and the ones that showed up less than 5 times I&amp;#39;m including here as well), the best damage types, in order are: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sizz (174)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zap (149)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frizz (138)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Woosh (130)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Crack (115)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bang (107)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zam (61)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, the meta for the &lt;strong&gt;Top 20&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appearances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Zoma&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Wight King&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Boreal Serpent&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dragonlord&amp;#39;s True Form&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bone Baron&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dragonlord&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hellion&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Killing Machine&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Devilmoth&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Draguar&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Moosifer&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Baramos&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Buffalo Wing&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bunicorn&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Cosmic Chimaera&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Drackmage&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dracky&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Ewwnicorn&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Fightgeist&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Green Dragon&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Imp&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Knight Errant&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Royal Reptile&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Seaslime&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Slionheart&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Stark Raven&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No surprise that Zoma keeps it&amp;#39;s stranglehold on the top spot. And of course he pairs really well with WK, the two have each other&amp;#39;s back in Arena. Fewer ghosts than last week, but as you can see from the bottom of the list, a whole bunch of random filler on the teams. Speaking of team comps, here are the rarity comps of the top 20 for this 220 weight week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rarity Composition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Count&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;USAAA&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;UUSAF&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;USSAC&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;UUSA&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;USSAF&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;UUUCF&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;UUUDE&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were a few particular teams in the Top 20 that impressed me, so congrats, you get super special awards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#39;Mrs. Frizzle&amp;#39;s Magic School Bus&amp;#39; award goes to Master, who ran a team of Dragonlord, Cosmic Chimaera, Hellion, Green Dragon, and a Wight King with Frizzle learned.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#39;This isn&amp;#39;t even my final form&amp;#39; award goes to Nibb Fan, the all-too-obvious alt account for Nibb&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And finally the &amp;#39;Addicted to Crack&amp;#39; award goes to Nightblade, who taught his Slionheart Blizzard Rush, his WK Crackle, and his Fightgest Crack.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers everyone!

    "body": "Greetings all, I am JackBeNimble in the Discord and JackBQuick in game. I finished T-14th in our first arena ever and I gotta say, Arena is my favorite content so far. In keeping with our communities data-centric lean, I've kept track of all my opponents from each tier (Hard - 80 pts, Medium - 60 pts, and Easy - 40 points) in order to gauge which units are the most used. Now that the tournament is done, I also grabbed the units of the top 20 players to look for who the best of the best is using, and how.\n\nCongrats to Nightblades on finishing Top, I know it was a hardfought battle with Nibb and 豆沙包. Also, big shoutout to my favorite name encountered during my matches, the player who just had the Japanese character for 'bong' four times in a row.\n\nFirst, a quick note about the data, even though I tracked every opponent I saw on screen, that was still only 231 opponents, or 77 per tier. That is a sample size small enough to make my results basically non-representative, but it's still better than nothing. I'll also only be sharing the results for Hard and Top 20, but if there's enough demand for the Mid and Easy tiers, I'll add those in.\n\nSo who are the most used units in the folks I encountered in Hard?\n\n|*Unit*|*Number of Appearances*|\n|:-|:-|\n|Wight King|48|\n|Zoma|35|\n|Killing Machine|30|\n|Dragonlord|24|\n|Dragonlord's True Form|20|\n|Bone Baron|16|\n|Hellion|16|\n|King Bubble Slime|15|\n|Armful|12|\n|Emperor Slime|11|\n|Hell Gladiator|9|\n|Archdemon|8|\n|Pickled Slime|8|\n|Hybrid|7|\n|Baramos|6|\n|Great Troll|6|\n|Lethal Armour|6|\n|Prism Peacock|6|\n|Slionheart|6|\n|Angel Slime|5|\n|Great Dragon|5|\n|Metal Dragon|5|\n|Moosifer|5|\n|Royal Reptile|5|\n|Umbra|5|\n\nNo huge surprise at the top 5 - Two of the best S units available and the ones widely advised to get on the re-roll banner, along with three well-regarded U (???) units. I also expected to see the high-powered A units of Hellion and Bone Baron get good use, along with the free As that we all could get fully awakened (Armful, KBS, PS). I'm surprised Hybird is so low given how much hype (imo, unwarranted hype), that unit received for use in Arena. I'm also VERY surprised at how little I saw RR, given that he is one of the best units for countering Zoma and KM.\n\nThe average level of units in Hard was 93.62, and the average Awakening was 2.89\n\nGiven these units (and the ones that showed up less than 5 times I'm including here as well), the best damage types, in order are:\n\n1. Sizz (137) \\[Dread Dragon meta anyone?\\]\n2. Frizz (120)\n3. Zap (119)\n4. Woosh (94)\n5. Bang (93)\n6. Crack (91)\n7. Zam (48!)\n\nMakes me want to get Halberdsaurus all that much faster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the **Top 20**, the meta looked more like this:\n\n|*Unit*|*Appearances*|\n|:-|:-|\n|Zoma|19|\n|Wight King|13|\n|Dragonlord's True Form|12|\n|Killing Machine|12|\n|Ghost|10|\n|Boreal Serpent|8|\n|Hellion|4|\n|Royal Reptile|3|\n|Slionheart|3|\n|Baramos|2|\n|Dragonlord|2|\n|Pickled Slime|2|\n|Angel Slime|1|\n|Bone Baron|1|\n|Draguar|1|\n|Hybird|1|\n|Lips|1|\n|Queen Slime|1|\n|Umbra|1|\n\nObviously, a big difference is the usage of the F rank Ghost to fill out the UUSSF roster at 235 weight (although one of those Ghosts had Cock-a-doodle-doo added on, and not Midheal). Big brained Kage bringin' a Lips to a Zoma fight (legitimately - Zoma is weak to Woosh). More Boreal Serpents than I would've guessed, and less RR, but overall it makes sense. Looks like Nibb was the only one using Draguar as his Zoma-killer, everyone else must've been relying on WK (or RR like me).\n\nExcited to see how 220 weight changes strats! Hope this has been interesting, and happy battling!\n\nEdit: Typos",

I&amp;#39;ll also only be sharing the results for Hard and Top 20, but if there&amp;#39;s enough demand for the Mid and Easy tiers, I&amp;#39;ll add those in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So who are the most used units in the folks I encountered in Hard?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Number of Appearances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Wight King&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Zoma&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Killing Machine&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dragonlord&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dragonlord&amp;#39;s True Form&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bone Baron&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hellion&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;King Bubble Slime&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Armful&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Emperor Slime&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hell Gladiator&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Archdemon&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Pickled Slime&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Baramos&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Great Troll&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Lethal Armour&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Prism Peacock&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Slionheart&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Angel Slime&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Great Dragon&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Metal Dragon&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Moosifer&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Royal Reptile&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No huge surprise at the top 5 - Two of the best S units available and the ones widely advised to get on the re-roll banner, along with three well-regarded U (???) units. I also expected to see the high-powered A units of Hellion and Bone Baron get good use, along with the free As that we all could get fully awakened (Armful, KBS, PS). I&amp;#39;m surprised Hybird is so low given how much hype (imo, unwarranted hype), that unit received for use in Arena. I&amp;#39;m also VERY surprised at how little I saw RR, given that he is one of the best units for countering Zoma and KM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The average level of units in Hard was 93.62, and the average Awakening was 2.89&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given these units (and the ones that showed up less than 5 times I&amp;#39;m including here as well), the best damage types, in order are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sizz (137) [Dread Dragon meta anyone?]&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frizz (120)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zap (119)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Woosh (94)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bang (93)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Crack (91)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zam (48!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Makes me want to get Halberdsaurus all that much faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;Top 20&lt;/strong&gt;, the meta looked more like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appearances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Zoma&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Wight King&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dragonlord&amp;#39;s True Form&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Killing Machine&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Boreal Serpent&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hellion&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Royal Reptile&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Slionheart&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Baramos&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dragonlord&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Pickled Slime&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Angel Slime&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bone Baron&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Draguar&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hybird&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Lips&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Queen Slime&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a big difference is the usage of the F rank Ghost to fill out the UUSSF roster at 235 weight (although one of those Ghosts had Cock-a-doodle-doo added on, and not Midheal). Big brained Kage bringin&amp;#39; a Lips to a Zoma fight (legitimately - Zoma is weak to Woosh). More Boreal Serpents than I would&amp;#39;ve guessed, and less RR, but overall it makes sense. Looks like Nibb was the only one using Draguar as his Zoma-killer, everyone else must&amp;#39;ve been relying on WK (or RR like me).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excited to see how 220 weight changes strats! Hope this has been interesting, and happy battling!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Typos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
