I would recommend starting with learning about your partner’s own experiences, it might make it easier to open up about your own, and you can both share how that may or may not change the needs you have from the relationship. \nLastly and maybe sadly not everyone can support people with trauma, but as long as we/those with trauma don’t expect our partner to solve it for us I think we have a great chance to make a happy life together.

Marriage is not a duty or a prison sentence, nor is it an excuse to verbally abuse someone else. We have to treat each other with love and care and keep each other supported. If you don’t do that this is what happens. Right or wrong your dad didn’t do anything to hurt you, you need to take a step back. I suspect what you are really angry at is the realisation that relationships are fragile and your perhaps feeling vulnerable and blame him for his action, as it was the final action that ended the marriage, abandoning you.\n\nTherapy will help untangle this, but above all do not just reject your dad.

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your dad is human if he was unhappy it’s no surprise he found comfort somewhere other than with your mom. Marriage is not a duty or a prison sentence, nor is it an excuse to verbally abuse someone else. We have to treat each other with love and care and keep each other supported. If you don’t do that this is what happens. Right or wrong your dad didn’t do anything to hurt you, you need to take a step back. I suspect what you are really angry at is the realisation that relationships are fragile and your perhaps feeling vulnerable and blame him for his action, as it was the final action that ended the marriage, abandoning you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therapy will help untangle this, but above all do not just reject your dad. You could equally question your mums behaviour. Just make sure you don’t replicate it with your future relationships.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Jeeeez… what year is it? Don’t women work? Then here you are, earning well, successful, and the tables are turned just a tiny little bit, do you see how you’re evaluating him?\n\nIf you really like guy who is earning, sounds stable, contributing, and not a dependent on you, then I don’t see the issue here. If he’s insecure that he would be some how emasculated by you being more successful or doing things that are not lowkey (that I assume you would have to pay more for), I’d be very surprised. This is common in 99% of couples, and normally the man earning more, and they seem to be ok with it so what’s stopping you?\n\nYou’d could focus on what his life goals are, does he have values that reflect your own or you admire etc. There are so many things that create a decent person you can have a life with that make abstract coin counting pointless. \n\nYou’re NOT wrong imo to want someone who’s not a dependent on you if you don’t want it. Personally I would never date someone who can’t pull their weight to a level that means we can do what makes us happy together, but my red line is not if they earned 20% or 200% of my salary, it is that they aren’t expecting a meal ticket and they share what they can.",
