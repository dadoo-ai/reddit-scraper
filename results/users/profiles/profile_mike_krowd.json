In all honesty, I don't have a clue what 90% of the shit that is said on these threads even means. With that said, here are my thoughts on why LEAPs on Cannabis might print. \n\n  \nAnalysis \n\n* My skepticism about the sector kept me on the sidelines for the meteoric rise and ultimate fall of the sector \n* The fall has been steep. For example, TLRY has been battered. It's down 96.7% from its all-time high of $148.30 and down 80% from its 52 Week high of  $25.68\n* Valuations of Cannabis stocks have never been rational but these stocks continue to be attractive to retail investors (well represented on Robinhood's Top 100 most popular). \n* This year alone, we have seen irrational behavior significantly impact individual stock prices due to retail day traders armed with a Robinhood account, a stimulus cheque, and deep-rooted nihilism. Just a few examples from this past summer: KODK, HRTZ, NKLA, and even to a certain extent, TSLA, ZM, SNOW) \n* I feel it's worth pointing out that the fundamentals and technical nature of any stock only matter until they don't. Perhaps for the average retail trader, they never did. Bankruptcy? Who cares. No revenue? Don't care. Fucked up PE Ratios? Sure. The price of the stock is only dictated by what others are paying for it. \n* In short - stocks going 1-10x in a matter of days on any inkling of positive news should be crazy but the market has proven that it isn't. This presents an opportunity to purchase relatively inexpensive LEAPs on strikes that seem astronomically high but could very well be in line with a 1-3 day Robinhood binge\n* This leads me to my next point, the possibility/probability of favorable news that could trigger a run. \n\nPossible Good News\n\n* More Favorable Political Climate: Joe has been historically anti-weed and he won't take a stance now given that Trump will use it against him (LAW AND ORDER!) But...Kamala has said that she was in favor of decriminalizing it as recently as last year and she'll be calling the shots anyway. \n* Legalization potential is high: Shifting public sentiment and Potential Tax Rev mean legalization could gain favor on both sides of the aisle. \n* Consolidation/M&amp;A as downside protection\n* In the short term - Increased lockdowns and seasonal change for a significant portion of the world will lead to more time indoors, more boredom, and the potential increases in demand. \n* The stress and anxiety caused by COVID and a poor economy might lead to growth in first-time users, contributing to accelerated growth for the segment. \n\nIn conclusion, Cannabis isn't going anywhere and neither is stupidity. A run on Cannabis stocks will likely be triggered by the good news of any kind and there are a lot of people willing to binge on relatively low-cost shares/options. \n\nTLRY 21st JAN 2022 $17.50c  \nTLRY 21st Jan 2022 $40.00c\n\nTLDR\n\n1.

Once I got home, I realized there was some pitting and rust spots on the shaft (see above).\n\nDoes anyone know if this will have an impact on the club's playability? I am covered by Golf Town's 7-day return policy and still have a few days left before I need to make a decision.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kn1d7g8mvax31.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f133f55f22bcbe5443aa22483fb9da8824093026",
