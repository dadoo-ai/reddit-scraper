This includes 100K Flex Credits and unlocks tools such as Prompt Builder and Agent Builder. However, some users have reported that even after adding Foundations, the Einstein Agents permission set license remains disabled.\n\nThis might be because certain features, like Prompt Templates, require an Einstein for Service, Einstein for Sales, or Einstein Platform license. So, even if you're building a custom Slack-connected agent and not using the default agent, you might still need one of these Einstein licenses to get started.\n\nRegarding Data Cloud, the 10,000 Foundations credits are a good starting point, but they might not be sufficient for full activation. To enable features like ingestion, segmentation, and record linking, you may need to ensure that Data Cloud Provisioning is added to your org. This provisioning includes 250,000 Data Services credits, 1 TB of data storage, and other resources",
