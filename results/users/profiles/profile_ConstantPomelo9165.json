It was very expensive don’t get me wrong, but it was suuuper worth it! I lost about 9 pounds altogether in 6-7 months and my goals of having more energy and a solid routine were both met. I’d say, if you have just a bit more to really splurge on your health, this is it. You should do both. I also had the unlimited pack for all memberships and would do each about 4x a week. \n\nLater I reduced my memberships by removing pilates and OTF due to a recent move and busy work season. I’m now trying to get back to that same routine (minus the Pilates - I didn’t really feel much of a difference). \n\nI believe OTF was $179/unlimited; yoga $135/unlimited; pilates $209/unlimited.",
