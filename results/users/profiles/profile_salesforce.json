If so, yes, with more and more news to come later this and early next year.   \nWe've announced a number of generative AI innovations that can be used to increase development velocity, such as Einstein CodeGen (LINK: https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-codegen-unpacked-written-english-phrases-become-executable-code-with-conversational-ai/), which is a generative AI model that can generate code in a variety of programming languages. This can help developers to write code more quickly and efficiently. This is built on the concept of conversational AI programming.   \nWe also announced Einstein Copilot (LINK: https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2023/09/12/ai-einstein-news-dreamforce/), a new generative AI-powered conversational assistant for every Salesforce application, baked seamlessly into the flow of work to drive significant productivity gains. For developers, Einstein Copilot will be able to turn natural language prompts into Apex code, suggest more effective and accurate code, and proactively scan for code vulnerabilities – all from within the developer environment.   \nAnd, we launched Einstein Prompt Builder (LINK: https://www.salesforce.com/products/ai-prompt-builder/) to enhance prompts in Salesforce or create their own prompt template. Prompt Builder lets our customers build, test, and refine trusted AI prompts within the Einstein Trust Layer, and also ground AI prompts with customer data coming from across their business. And lastly, they can then incorporate the prompted responses back in Salesforce record pages, email console, or wherever they work.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CC: Are you asking whether Salesforce will be focusing on using AI to help developers write code more quickly and efficiently? If so, yes, with more and more news to come later this and early next year.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe&amp;#39;ve announced a number of generative AI innovations that can be used to increase development velocity, such as Einstein CodeGen (LINK: &lt;a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-codegen-unpacked-written-english-phrases-become-executable-code-with-conversational-ai/\"&gt;https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-codegen-unpacked-written-english-phrases-become-executable-code-with-conversational-ai/&lt;/a&gt;), which is a generative AI model that can generate code in a variety of programming languages. This can help developers to write code more quickly and efficiently. This is built on the concept of conversational AI programming.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe also announced Einstein Copilot (LINK: &lt;a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2023/09/12/ai-einstein-news-dreamforce/\"&gt;https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2023/09/12/ai-einstein-news-dreamforce/&lt;/a&gt;), a new generative AI-powered conversational assistant for every Salesforce application, baked seamlessly into the flow of work to drive significant productivity gains. For developers, Einstein Copilot will be able to turn natural language prompts into Apex code, suggest more effective and accurate code, and proactively scan for code vulnerabilities – all from within the developer environment.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd, we launched Einstein Prompt Builder (LINK: &lt;a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/products/ai-prompt-builder/\"&gt;https://www.salesforce.com/products/ai-prompt-builder/&lt;/a&gt;) to enhance prompts in Salesforce or create their own prompt template. Prompt Builder lets our customers build, test, and refine trusted AI prompts within the Einstein Trust Layer, and also ground AI prompts with customer data coming from across their business. And lastly, they can then incorporate the prompted responses back in Salesforce record pages, email console, or wherever they work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
