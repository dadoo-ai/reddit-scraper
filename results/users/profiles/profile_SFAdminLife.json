I brought my mask and gloves just in case. I was only going to wear them if she pulled her usual bullshit and invited 30 people none of us knew. \n\nSurely, she wouldn’t. It’s a fucking pandemic and all. We show up. There are a shitload of cars. No! I panic inside. We didn’t even get to the front door and people I didn’t even know are trying to hug us. I decline politely and say that I am social distancing. These people give me a hard time about it. I ignore it and keep moving.\n\nI rush through the house. Seems empty. I figure the patio is safer...open air! Nope. All the people were out there. They also try to start hugging. I repeat that I am social distancing. MIL starts loudly saying that I’m paranoid because it’s just like the flu! Others join in asking if I actually believe the “conspiracy” and that I’m just clueless that it’s a hoax! My blood fucking boiled. MIL then shouts that I am just too stuck up to hug faaaamily.. This bitch forced me to say “look, I’m not here to debate or argue, but I have a compromised immune system and I have chosen to protect myself. I was going to wear a mask, but I was afraid I’d be shamed and made a spectacle of and here I am anyway”. \n\nI am a private person. MIL and her grape vine of gossip doesn’t need to know anything about my health! I have aplastic anemia. I’ve had it since about 10 yrs old. I just have to be careful. I should have never agreed to come to this. I grey rock her because she’d gossip her way into saying I have HIV or something. She’s that ignorant! \n\nThen, her idiot sister says, “oh, me too! I’m immune compromised, what do you have?” She’s not. I said hey, my medical information isn’t exactly birthday party material. Let’s celebrate my husband and keep things light. That was the best way I could think of to deflect in front of all these people.\n\nThe high point of the day was when everyone was gathered around getting cake (I stayed off to the side, distancing) and the aunt shouted, so....do you have any job leads? I was like, huh? She said “MIL told me you were let go!”. Fuck me. This bitch. I shouted back and said I wasn’t let go. I was laid off due to the pandemic in April. Im working with a recruiter who will place me when I am ready in July, so no, I don’t need job leads. I’m all set.\n\nShe was so deflated with that answer! My husband shouted at her that I earned way more than he did, so I’d have no problem. She shut up. My MIL was just waiting on any way to chip away at me. I’m a woman that stands up for myself. I don’t take her or her sister’s shit and never have. Well, I decided I will never ever set foot in that bitches house again. I felt attacked just for social distancing! I won’t give her that power again. She can come to my home instead, where bitch games aren’t played!",

How do you make sure supervisors don't receive chats directly from customers as they are auto assigned from the chat queue? I need to make sure only our agents receive the incoming chats from customers and the supervisors show online, but only receive chats if they are transfered from an agent or if they are conferenced in by an agent. I am using Lightning, Omni, and queue routing. I created a service presence for supervisors to select to come online for Chat Supervisor, but I am pretty much experimenting with the framework that goes behind it, so produce the functionality. I enabled skills based routed and thought about using those together to accomplish this  possibly via a skill assigned only to the supervisors, but would love some advice. Thank you!\n\nEdit: Another thing I'm toying with is possibly setting the routing to most available, then giving the agents a max capacity of 5 chats and supers a capacity of 1, so all chats would be routed to the most available agents first based on total capacity, then only hit up the supervisors if all agents are at their max?

    "body": "For those of us who do not take an entire week of vacation to accommodate your stepkids or SO’s kids (if you chose not to marry) spring break....what have been your absolute most annoying experiences? \n\nMaybe we can all vent a bit, laugh at each other’s horror stories, and even find some solutions from each other on how to make this time less “hellish”! \n\nMy first experience with spring break week in my second year of dating my now husband was him telling me his kids would be at their mother’s as it was her turn. He had already taken a week off, so I asked to get that time off work too. It was a couple months out, so it was no problem. I planned a romantic week away at a resort that I hadn’t been to since I was a kid. It was at a family owned resort on a hidden lake about 5 hours drive away from where we lived. I booked a small cabin perfect for two with a fireplace. Fast forward to the night before we were supposed to leave. \n\nHe mentions....MENTIONS that he will pack his kids stuff in the morning before we start our drive. It was such a casual mention lol. I said uh what? He said his ex had planned a trip out of town with her new husband, which was her affair partner, so YAY he’d have the kids! He had known this for two weeks but thought he’d surprise me! Fuck. Just fuck my life. Please note that I am child free and had never been on any vacation or overnight trip with any young kids before. I was stuck with two complaining kids in a one bedroom cabin for 5 days. I had to pay extra to have two twin beds added for them. I can say that it was the least romantic vacation I ever took and I vowed never to waste my hard earned vacation days listening to someone else’s kids scream their heads off, stomp all over nature, and give me migraines. I’d rather be a work!\n\nThere is a shittier side to not taking vacation days when the stepkids are here. Getting up for work everyday at 5am after being kept up by video game noise in the living room until...um all fucking night into the morning. Also, there’s a bonus of not even being in the same bed as your husband for a week because he falls asleep watching his kids play video games all night.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of us who do not take an entire week of vacation to accommodate your stepkids or SO’s kids (if you chose not to marry) spring break....what have been your absolute most annoying experiences? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can all vent a bit, laugh at each other’s horror stories, and even find some solutions from each other on how to make this time less “hellish”! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first experience with spring break week in my second year of dating my now husband was him telling me his kids would be at their mother’s as it was her turn. He had already taken a week off, so I asked to get that time off work too. It was a couple months out, so it was no problem. I planned a romantic week away at a resort that I hadn’t been to since I was a kid. It was at a family owned resort on a hidden lake about 5 hours drive away from where we lived. I booked a small cabin perfect for two with a fireplace. Fast forward to the night before we were supposed to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He mentions....MENTIONS that he will pack his kids stuff in the morning before we start our drive. It was such a casual mention lol. I said uh what? He said his ex had planned a trip out of town with her new husband, which was her affair partner, so YAY he’d have the kids! He had known this for two weeks but thought he’d surprise me! Fuck. Just fuck my life. Please note that I am child free and had never been on any vacation or overnight trip with any young kids before. I was stuck with two complaining kids in a one bedroom cabin for 5 days. I had to pay extra to have two twin beds added for them. I can say that it was the least romantic vacation I ever took and I vowed never to waste my hard earned vacation days listening to someone else’s kids scream their heads off, stomp all over nature, and give me migraines. I’d rather be a work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a shittier side to not taking vacation days when the stepkids are here. Getting up for work everyday at 5am after being kept up by video game noise in the living room until...um all fucking night into the morning.
