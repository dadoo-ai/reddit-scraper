It said it could not find it in `angular/forms`. I checked the documentation and I cannot find a single mention of `provideReactiveForms` anywhere, only `ReactiveFormsModule`.\n\nI questioned Gemini on this and it was adamant.

For about 3 seconds I get long intermittent bursts out sounds, then more sporadic bursts of sound, then long silence for several minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sound that goes come out sounds fairly clear and normal, it&amp;#39;s just the sporadicness of it all that is the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List anything you&amp;#39;ve done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have verified that the speaker wires are installed correctly (gold/bronze into Red and silver into Black), I have removed and reinserted the wires multiple times, I have installed my ASRock X570 Pro4 MB&amp;#39;s Audio drivers to the most updated version, I have verified the 3.5mm is inserted into the correct input on my PC and even tried the other options before returning it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve connected it to my Nintendo Switch as an alternate Source to test that and it rhythmically goes from muted to speakers on the Switch and it sounds like a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post relevant photos of build/parts here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Q55hqVCM9vcycXJL9\"&gt;https://photos.app.goo.gl/Q55hqVCM9vcycXJL9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide any additional details you wish below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m beginning to think I&amp;#39;ve gotten a faulty set of speakers but wanted to see if there is anything else I can check or troubleshoot from those more in the know before I begin a return process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve twisted the 3.5mm in my Switch to a point where the heartbeat sound stops and the audio seems to work fine on the switch but if I touch it or move it too much the 3.5mm spins away from this &amp;quot;sweet spot&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve attempted to do the same in my PC but spinning the 3.5mm does not result in any &amp;quot;Sweet spot&amp;quot; similar to the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I slammed my brakes and avoided contact, honked my horn to alert him to my presence, and continued driving behind him.\n\nThe black truck then turned on some high-intensity LED rear lights that nearly blinded me and started driving ~10 mph.  When we approached the exit to the highway I was going to take we also got off. When we were both on the off-ramp, he stopped his vehicle, blocking me, and opened his door. I then went to pass him and continue on my way. As I drove alongside him, he motioned for me to stop and lower my window, which I did to see if he needed assistance or something else (please do not comment about the intelligence of this action as it does not add to the conversation). As I lowered my window, he shouted at me, \"You got a problem with me?\" and approached my vehicle, making lowering his hand to his hip and making movement as if he was drawing a weapon but keeping it below the window line.  Assuming it was a weapon and fearing for my life I accelerated and drove away.\n\nThe black truck eventually entered the highway as well and drove behind me for ~.5 miles before speeding away off into the distance.\n\nI drive a Tesla and got all of this on video, multiple angles of the initial incident, clear footage of his license plate, clear footage of his face and person, and full clear footage of the gun that he definitely drew. I would link to these videos but that is against the rules of this sub so for the purpose of this conversation you'll have to take me at my word.\n\nToday I contacted Illinois State Police, who directed me to local Glen Ellyn police.  I went on-site and provided the above statement along with the video evidence. The officer who took my statement reviewed the video and told me that I \"undersold my description of him trying to run me off the road\" and that he \"Definitely drew his weapon on you\".  He asked if I wanted to press charges and I told him that I did in which case he said that the charge would be \"Disorderly Conduct\" and asked me if I felt \"alarmed or disturbed\", the tone of his voice clearly implying that these were legal terms (which I confirmed when I looked up Disorderly Conduct in Illinois: \n\n&gt;(720 ILCS 5/Art. 26 heading)\n&gt;ARTICLE 26. DISORDERLY CONDUCT\n\n&gt;(720 ILCS 5/26-1) (from Ch. 38, par. 26-1)\n\n&gt;Sec. 26-1. Disorderly conduct.\n&gt;\n&gt;    (a) A person commits disorderly conduct when he or she knowingly:\n \n&gt;       (1) Does any act in such unreasonable manner as to alarm or disturb another and to provoke a breach of the peace;\n\nI responded that yes I definitely felt alarmed or disturbed and feared for my life as my assumption was that he had a gun based off the movement of his arm and body language even if I did not at the time see the weapon, it was clear his intent was to show that he had one.\n\nHe said that he was going to set up a lineup for me to come in and attempt to ID the man and if I correctly ID'ed him, it would go to trial for disorderly conduct and if I didn't there would be no charges pressed.\n\nMy questions for you are:\n\n* Is disorderly conduct the correct charge? I feel like what he did goes beyond Disorderly Conduct as I don't see any mention of weapons or firearms when I read the description.  Another person mentioned Intimidation:\n\n&gt;(720 ILCS 5/Art. 12, Subdiv. 15 heading)\n&gt;SUBDIVISION 15. INTIMIDATION\n&gt;(Source: P.A. 96-1551, eff. 7-1-11.)\n&gt;\n&gt;(720 ILCS 5/12-6) (from Ch. 38, par. 12-6)\n&gt;Sec. 12-6. Intimidation.\n&gt;\n&gt;(a) A person commits intimidation when, with intent to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, he or she communicates to another, directly or indirectly by any means, a threat to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts:\n&gt;\n&gt;        (1) Inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person or on property; or\n&gt;        (2) Subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or\n&gt;        (3) Commit a felony or Class A misdemeanor; or\n&gt;        (4) Accuse any person of an offense; or\n&gt;        (5) Expose any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or\n&gt;        (6) Take action as a public official against anyone or anything, or withhold official action, or cause such action or withholding; or\n&gt;        (7) Bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective action. \n\n* Are charges truly entirely dependent on my correctly ID'ing the man in a lineup when there is clear video footage of the incident and the man himself?",

He asked if I wanted to press charges and I told him that I did in which case he said that the charge would be &amp;quot;Disorderly Conduct&amp;quot; and asked me if I felt &amp;quot;alarmed or disturbed&amp;quot;, the tone of his voice clearly implying that these were legal terms (which I confirmed when I looked up Disorderly Conduct in Illinois: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(720 ILCS 5/Art. 26 heading)\nARTICLE 26. DISORDERLY CONDUCT&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(720 ILCS 5/26-1) (from Ch. 38, par. 26-1)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sec. 26-1. Disorderly conduct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(a) A person commits disorderly conduct when he or she knowingly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  (1) Does any act in such unreasonable manner as to alarm or disturb another and to provoke a breach of the peace;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I responded that yes I definitely felt alarmed or disturbed and feared for my life as my assumption was that he had a gun based off the movement of his arm and body language even if I did not at the time see the weapon, it was clear his intent was to show that he had one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that he was going to set up a lineup for me to come in and attempt to ID the man and if I correctly ID&amp;#39;ed him, it would go to trial for disorderly conduct and if I didn&amp;#39;t there would be no charges pressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My questions for you are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is disorderly conduct the correct charge? I feel like what he did goes beyond Disorderly Conduct as I don&amp;#39;t see any mention of weapons or firearms when I read the description.  Another person mentioned Intimidation:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(720 ILCS 5/Art. 12, Subdiv. 15 heading)\nSUBDIVISION 15. INTIMIDATION\n(Source: P.A. 96-1551, eff. 7-1-11.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(720 ILCS 5/12-6) (from Ch. 38, par. 12-6)\nSec. 12-6. Intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(a) A person commits intimidation when, with intent to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, he or she communicates to another, directly or indirectly by any means, a threat to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   (1) Inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person or on property; or\n   (2) Subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or\n   (3) Commit a felony or Class A misdemeanor; or\n   (4) Accuse any person of an offense; or\n   (5) Expose any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or\n   (6) Take action as a public official against anyone or anything, or withhold official action, or cause such action or withholding; or\n   (7) Bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective action. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are charges truly entirely dependent on my correctly ID&amp;#39;ing the man in a lineup when there is clear video footage of the incident and the man himself?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "Like many of you, I'm sure, several of my launch playthroughs were with Haesteinn.  I'd go, declare war on a random Kingdom and take it over trying to get the feel of the game and pick up the mechanics.  It generally went fairly well and met my expectations for the games \"Easy\" designation of the character.\n\nAfter a bit I've decided to take a break until the first patch and then hop back in which I am doing now.  Now that they've got most of the basic issues resolved I wanted to play a full playthrough and Vikings were always my favorite playthroughs in Ck2 and one of my favorites was Haesteinn -&gt; Viking Netherlands.  So I hopped in, did my normal early game steps and declared my Invasion for Frisa.  A year later, dead.\n\nSo I restarted. Two years later, dead.\n\nRestarted, this time declared war, invaded, and 40% war score in France declared holy war on my and before I could get back to defend, they took my one county.\n\nRestarted, murdered by courtiers.\n\nThis went on about 15 restarts and either I died before the war ended or one of my neighbors declared Holy war to take my one county before I could finish my war. And I'm not waiting very long, maybe 6 months at most before I declare my war.  On day one 75% of Haesteinn's court is made up of French Cathlics who HATE you (Including your SPYMASTER) who all decide to assassinate you.  I've tried replacing the spymaster (which is often times impossible because there's not many courtiers and when you get more they usually have awful Intrigue), swaying her etc.  I tried imprisoning but this just makes everyone else hates me.  \n\nThe war itself is easy and I often times destroy their entire army in one battler (though often times when this happens it results in 80% of their vassals declaring independence immediately and I lose the majority of the counties I'm trying to win the war).\n\nAt this point it just seems to be kind of ridiculous. I mean I'm not a new player - I've got a LOT of hours in CK2 and like I said I've been able to successfully get a generation into the playthrough before I stop willingly before patch but now? Now it just seems to be a LOT more difficult than the \"Easy\" designation would make it seem.  Normally I don't mind dying and will obviously play through but the entire point of the Haesteinn playthrough is to use his event troups to take a random sizable kingdom and start viking it up wherever you want in the world.  Am I missing some obvious play here? Is anyone else seeing this massive spike in difficulty for the Haesteinn playthrough?",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many of you, I&amp;#39;m sure, several of my launch playthroughs were with Haesteinn.  I&amp;#39;d go, declare war on a random Kingdom and take it over trying to get the feel of the game and pick up the mechanics.  It generally went fairly well and met my expectations for the games &amp;quot;Easy&amp;quot; designation of the character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a bit I&amp;#39;ve decided to take a break until the first patch and then hop back in which I am doing now.  Now that they&amp;#39;ve got most of the basic issues resolved I wanted to play a full playthrough and Vikings were always my favorite playthroughs in Ck2 and one of my favorites was Haesteinn -&amp;gt; Viking Netherlands.  So I hopped in, did my normal early game steps and declared my Invasion for Frisa.  A year later, dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I restarted. Two years later, dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Restarted, this time declared war, invaded, and 40% war score in France declared holy war on my and before I could get back to defend, they took my one county.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Restarted, murdered by courtiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This went on about 15 restarts and either I died before the war ended or one of my neighbors declared Holy war to take my one county before I could finish my war. And I&amp;#39;m not waiting very long, maybe 6 months at most before I declare my war.

I definitely expected an increase but maybe around the realm of a 50-75% increase not a 300%.  So I poked around and did some math and it definitely doesn't seem to add up.\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n* I'm driving a 2020 Model 3 LR AWR\n* Based off a quick research, my math assumes 29 kWh per 100 miles for the Model 3 LR AWR per [this source](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2019_Tesla_Model_3.shtml)\n* I have driven ~500 miles in the date range of the this bill which starts only 3 days before my pickup date\n* I've been working from home since March and so my power usage compared to last year is not a good indicator so I am using an average of the previous 4 months to get an average monthly usage of 266 kWh per month\n* My usage for this current billing cycle is 786 kWh, an increase of 502 kWh from my average\n* I am using a 110v 15A charger which gives me on average 5mph charging. I leave my car plugged in 100% of the time I'm at home\n* Based again off some quick research I am assuming 80% efficiency for this charging style\n\nBased off the above facts and assumptions, my math tells me I should be expecting an ~180 kWh increase, not the 500 one I did saw.\n\nMy math:\n\n29 kWh per 100 miles * 5 = 140 kWh consumption total\n\n140 kWh consumption / .8 efficiency = 181.25 kWh charged\n\nIs my math bonked up? Should I be looking at an electricity leak?\n\n**Edit**\n\nSome additional notes:\n\n* I remembered that my tripometer has been running since production and so I don't have to guess at how much power I've consumed: 142 kWh - this does include 15 miles pre pick up but I'm including those since I'd rather round up\n* I also remembered that I took ownership at ~50 charge so I've added in an additional 22.5 kWh into my calculations to compensate for the initial charge to 80% capacity. This brings my total consumption to 164.5 kWh at 80% efficiency or 205.6 kWh. Still well below the 500 I'm seeing.",

    "body": "Ok so what I'm looking to do is a bit convoluted but not too bad. I'm trying to connect our BigCommerce store with SalesForce.  On a new order I want it to create a new account if one doesn't exist, create a new contact if one doesn't exist, create a new opportunity if one doesn't exist, then add the line items from the order as opportunity products. The problem with this is, currently the Zapier SalesForce actions do not support Line Item functionality.  With multiple line items SKU comes over as an array \"PARTNUMBER1, PARTNUMBER2, PARTNUMBER3\" and the quantity comes over as \"QUANTITY1, QUANTITY2, QUANTITY3\". Obviously when it tries to find a Price Book Entry by searching for \"PARTNUMBER1, PARTNUMBER2, PARTNUMBER3\" it doesn't work. With other connections that have Line Item support it works as it is supposed to but Zapier says they cannot do Line Item support with Sales Force due to the API (however OneSaas can do handle line items fine so I dunno).\n\nMy solution is to insert a Code by Zapier action with some JavaScript to parse out the arrays for Sku and Quantity into individual variables (sku1, sku2, sku3, qty 1, qty2, qty3) in the output that I can then pull from in multiple iterations of \"Find Price Book Entry\" and \"Create Opportunity Product\".  Yes I know that if an order has more line items than I plan for those line items will get cut off. I am fine with this as 90% of our orders will fall within the number and I hope to create an action that fires off if there are more line items to create a salesforce task that says to touch the order.\n\nThe variables I input are \"linesAmt\" for the number if line items, \"skuArray\" for the array that contains the skus, and \"qtyArray\" for the array that holds the quantities. Here is the (poor but workable for the time being as a test case to make sure this works as I expect it to) Java script\n\n    if (inputData.linesAmt == 1) {\n    \n      var sku1 = inputData.skuArray[0];\n      var qty1 = inputData.qtyArray[0];\n    \n      output = {\n        'sku1': sku1,\n        'qty1': qty1\n      };\n    \n    }\n    \n    if (inputData.linesAmt == 2) {\n    \n      var sku1 = inputData.skuArray[0];\n      var sku2 = inputData.skuArray[1];\n      var qty1 = inputData.qtyArray[0];\n      var qty2 = inputData.qtyArray[1];\n    \n      output = {\n        'sku1': sku1,\n        'sku2': sku2,\n        'qty1': qty1,\n        'qty2': qty2\n      };\n    \n    }\n    \n    if (inputData.linesAmt == 3) {\n    \n      var sku1 = inputData.skuArray[0];\n      var sku2 = inputData.skuArray[1];\n      var sku3 = inputData.skuArray[2];\n      var qty1 = inputData.qtyArray[0];\n      var qty2 = inputData.qtyArray[1];\n      var qty3 = inputData.qtyArray[2];\n    \n      output = {\n        'sku1': sku1,\n        'sku2': sku2,\n        'sku3': sky3,\n        'qty1': qty1,\n        'qty2': qty2,\n        'qty3': qty3\n      };\n    \n    }\n    \n    if (inputData.linesAmt == 4) {\n    \n      var sku1 = inputData.skuArray[0];\n      var sku2 = inputData.skuArray[1];\n      var sku3 = inputData.skuArray[2];\n      var sku4 = inputData.skuArray[3];\n      var qty1 = inputData.qtyArray[0];\n      var qty2 = inputData.qtyArray[1];\n      var qty3 = inputData.qtyArray[2];\n      var qty4 = inputData.qtyArray[3];\n    \n      output = {\n        'sku1': sku1,\n        'sku2': sku2,\n        'sku3': sku3,\n        'sku4': sku4,\n        'qty1': qty1,\n        'qty2': qty2,\n        'qty3': qty3,\n        'qty4': qty4\n      };\n    \n    \n    }\n\n\nAfter creating this it works ish, except for the fact that instead of pulling the full sku it is just pulling the first two characters. For Quantity \"qty1\" pulls over the first quantity (though if it were double digit I'm sure it would only pull over the first digit) and \"qty2\" returns the comma. My knowledge of JavaScript is basic so my guess is I just don't remember how Arrays actually work or maybe it's an issue with how the data is brought in through Zapier.  Any suggestions?",

Yes I know that if an order has more line items than I plan for those line items will get cut off. I am fine with this as 90% of our orders will fall within the number and I hope to create an action that fires off if there are more line items to create a salesforce task that says to touch the order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The variables I input are &amp;quot;linesAmt&amp;quot; for the number if line items, &amp;quot;skuArray&amp;quot; for the array that contains the skus, and &amp;quot;qtyArray&amp;quot; for the array that holds the quantities. Here is the (poor but workable for the time being as a test case to make sure this works as I expect it to) Java script&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (inputData.linesAmt == 1) {\n\n  var sku1 = inputData.skuArray[0];\n  var qty1 = inputData.qtyArray[0];\n\n  output = {\n    &amp;#39;sku1&amp;#39;: sku1,\n    &amp;#39;qty1&amp;#39;: qty1\n  };\n\n}\n\nif (inputData.linesAmt == 2) {\n\n  var sku1 = inputData.skuArray[0];\n  var sku2 = inputData.skuArray[1];\n  var qty1 = inputData.qtyArray[0];\n  var qty2 = inputData.qtyArray[1];\n\n  output = {\n    &amp;#39;sku1&amp;#39;: sku1,\n    &amp;#39;sku2&amp;#39;: sku2,\n    &amp;#39;qty1&amp;#39;: qty1,\n    &amp;#39;qty2&amp;#39;: qty2\n  };\n\n}\n\nif (inputData.linesAmt == 3) {\n\n  var sku1 = inputData.skuArray[0];\n  var sku2 = inputData.skuArray[1];\n  var sku3 = inputData.skuArray[2];\n  var qty1 = inputData.qtyArray[0];\n  var qty2 = inputData.qtyArray[1];\n  var qty3 = inputData.qtyArray[2];\n\n  output = {\n    &amp;#39;sku1&amp;#39;: sku1,\n    &amp;#39;sku2&amp;#39;: sku2,\n    &amp;#39;sku3&amp;#39;: sky3,\n    &amp;#39;qty1&amp;#39;: qty1,\n    &amp;#39;qty2&amp;#39;: qty2,\n    &amp;#39;qty3&amp;#39;: qty3\n  };\n\n}\n\nif (inputData.linesAmt == 4) {\n\n  var sku1 = inputData.skuArray[0];\n  var sku2 = inputData.skuArray[1];\n  var sku3 = inputData.skuArray[2];\n  var sku4 = inputData.skuArray[3];\n  var qty1 = inputData.qtyArray[0];\n  var qty2 = inputData.qtyArray[1];\n  var qty3 = inputData.qtyArray[2];\n  var qty4 = inputData.qtyArray[3];\n\n  output = {\n    &amp;#39;sku1&amp;#39;: sku1,\n    &amp;#39;sku2&amp;#39;: sku2,\n    &amp;#39;sku3&amp;#39;: sku3,\n    &amp;#39;sku4&amp;#39;: sku4,\n    &amp;#39;qty1&amp;#39;: qty1,\n    &amp;#39;qty2&amp;#39;: qty2,\n    &amp;#39;qty3&amp;#39;: qty3,\n    &amp;#39;qty4&amp;#39;: qty4\n  };\n\n\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After creating this it works ish, except for the fact that instead of pulling the full sku it is just pulling the first two characters. For Quantity &amp;quot;qty1&amp;quot; pulls over the first quantity (though if it were double digit I&amp;#39;m sure it would only pull over the first digit) and &amp;quot;qty2&amp;quot; returns the comma. My knowledge of JavaScript is basic so my guess is I just don&amp;#39;t remember how Arrays actually work or maybe it&amp;#39;s an issue with how the data is brought in through Zapier.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "I just finished building my new computer and I figured the best way to put it through it's paces was an extensive mod a thon with Skyrim.\n\nSo I went though, learned all about ENBs and Graphics mods (hadn't been able to do that before so that was fun), got that all installed (RealVision and all of his recommended graphics and texture mods) then went and learned all about current mod utilities. Last time I was I modded Skyrim we were all using NMM and BOSS none of this fancy MO and LOOT shenanigans. But honestly overall it's a much easier process than I remember it being. Except for the fact that when I try to run ReProccer for SkyRe compatability patches it just...doesn't work. \n\nAfter installing everything, cleaning all of the dirty edits in TOOL and fixing my load order, creating a Batch Patch in Wyre Bash I installed the [ReProccer](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28467/?tab=1&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D28467%26preview%3D&amp;pUp=1) and the the [All-in-One Compatibility Patch](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29375/?). I installed them through MO and set the .jar file to run through MO as explained in Gopher's video about the ReProccer patch process. However when I run it keeps telling me I'm missing Master esps like Dawnguard which are most definitely in there.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just finished building my new computer and I figured the best way to put it through it&amp;#39;s paces was an extensive mod a thon with Skyrim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I went though, learned all about ENBs and Graphics mods (hadn&amp;#39;t been able to do that before so that was fun), got that all installed (RealVision and all of his recommended graphics and texture mods) then went and learned all about current mod utilities. Last time I was I modded Skyrim we were all using NMM and BOSS none of this fancy MO and LOOT shenanigans. But honestly overall it&amp;#39;s a much easier process than I remember it being. Except for the fact that when I try to run ReProccer for SkyRe compatability patches it just...doesn&amp;#39;t work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After installing everything, cleaning all of the dirty edits in TOOL and fixing my load order, creating a Batch Patch in Wyre Bash I installed the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28467/?tab=1&amp;amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D28467%26preview%3D&amp;amp;pUp=1\"&gt;ReProccer&lt;/a&gt; and the the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29375/?\"&gt;All-in-One Compatibility Patch&lt;/a&gt;. I installed them through MO and set the .jar file to run through MO as explained in Gopher&amp;#39;s video about the ReProccer patch process. However when I run it keeps telling me I&amp;#39;m missing Master esps like Dawnguard which are most definitely in there. At first it was saying I was missing SkyRe.esm but that was when I was running it manually and not through MO. Now that I do it through MO it&amp;#39;s Dawnguard and other DLC Masters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I didn&amp;#39;t follow Gopher&amp;#39;s video exactly but it was because it seemed out of date (this is the biggest problem with Skyrim modding, processes change and old tutorials never get updated, though I suppose it&amp;#39;s fun to figure things out).

Ideally under is best so sell me on why the upgrade is worth it!\n\nUse: Gaming, Work and Media. Most of the gaming I do isn't too graphically intensive (A lot of Paradox Interactive games) but there are some out there that I would like to get that would be (GTAV, Shadows of Mordor, whatever the next Elder Scrolls game turns out to be) so it does need to be able to handle those and look good. Other than that it's for a lot of work related research and media consumption (movie / tv show streaming etc). If it can handle the gaming side of things, the rest shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIf you have any questions or need more info out of me please let me know! Other than that I welcome your critiques and suggestions! Also if any of you can recommend a good case for about the same price that doesn't look so....flashy I would appreciate it.

I'm aiming for around 250...will it get there eventually and I just need to be patient or should I start enacting some heating techniques? Also...what would you guys recommend to get that heat up?",

I just received an email regarding a call for applications for an exchange program for young, politically minded Indonesians interested in learning how the US electoral system works. Given the discussions going on in this subreddit, I figured a lot of you would be interested in this opportunity so I've talked to our lovely mod team and here we are!\n\n**Note:** I am not associated with USINDO or ACYPL or this exchange program in any way, I just felt many of you would appreciate hearing about this.\n\nAnd without further ado....\n\n\n\nThe United States - Indonesia Society ([USINDO](http://www.usindo.org)), in cooperation with the American Council of Young Political Leaders ([ACYPL](http://www.acypl.org)), is seeking applications from young national or provincially elected officials, political party representatives, public policy makers, political activists, campaign or election professional, political journalists or labor union representatives from Indonesia to participate in the 2014 United States Exchange Program. \n \nThe 2014 United States Exchange Program will include nine participants from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, of whom three will be from Indonesia.

If you charge 600 gold for leather you will get 0 gold because no one will buy it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then tested something out and put a perk into the first perk in the Speech tree and this did not lower prices at all or raise the amount merchants are offering me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of all of this I&amp;#39;m wondering; is the mod WAI? I&amp;#39;m fully behind the concept of me being an unskilled merchant and getting bamboozled but this just seems ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Since it will probably come up the other mods I have installed are: Hunterborn, RND, Frostfall, SkyTEST, AchieveTHAT, Guard Dialog Overhaul, BetterQuestObjectives, AlternativeStart and some minor graphics mods. Nothing else that SHOULD change the economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It has worked beautifully for the past 4 months I've been back except for a minor graphics card problem that was solved. \n\nSecondarily I cannot seem to get this stupid power supply out of the case for the life of me.

The experts of /r/malehairadvice to give me some suggestions for tweaks, styles, whathave you.

Feel free to offer any suggestions, but the beard stays.\n\n2)I live in Indonesia and while I can speak Indonesian fluently on higher education reform, national forestry policy and foreign affairs my vocab surrounding hair styles is...ahem...limited. To be honest my vocab surrounding hair styles in ENGLISH is limited so.....submitting pictures along with your recommendations and suggestions would be amazing!\n\n3)As you can tell from the side view picture I have a nasty cowlick on my right hand side.

    "body": "Hello /r/Fitness! I am a 27 year old male, 6'0\" and currently weighing in at 145lbs. I have been this size and weight for a little over a decade now despite my best efforts. I am fairly skinny but have no desires to bulk up to obscene proportions; I merely want to gain about 20-30lbs or so.  I have tried several times in the past but I can never even push past the 150lb mark despite my best efforts and working with trainers at my gym(s).  Below I will detail my regiment:\n\n* I will hit the gym 3 to 4 times a week for 1.5 hours a day. MWF and Sunday or Saturday if I have the time.\n* I begin and end each session with a protein shake. Not Whey Protein but something more along the lines of Muscle Milk as suggested by my trainer(s).\n* My daily calorie intake is around 3000, eating mainly meats and carbohydrates with fruits and veggies thrown in for good measure.\n* My routine begins with a 7.5 - 10 minute jog on the treadmill to warm up, around an hour of free weights and machines, and then a brief cool down run.  I won't get into specifics on the free weights and machines except that I follow what has been detailed to me by 3 different trainers now to the letter and push my self very hard. If you need specific info though just ask and I'll get more into it.\n* My life outside the gym is fairly sedentary. I work 8 hours in an office when I'm not traveling. I take a taxi to work and I live in a city where biking / walking is near impossible. \n* I usually keep this up for a year at a time before I get demotivated by the fact that I have gained 2-3lbs at most and any sort of muscle definition (which is not what I'm looking for honestly) disappears if I miss 2 gym sessions. (I have to travel for work every so often into the \"field\" as they say. Hard to find a gym in the middle of the rain-forest in Borneo).\n\nI've always had a very high metabolism and I know it won't last forever but I feel like even a high metabolism can't account for the lack of weight gain I've had.  Plus I'm nearing 30 and it hasn't even shown a glimmer of slowing down yet.\n\nAny advise /r/Fitness? Thanks in advance!\n\n**EDIT** The 3000 calorie was an estimate and I realized I did not include whatever calories those two shakes 3 times a week are if that matters at all...",
