I’ve been in this situation early in my career.  I would suggest discussing with your manager. Someone should be able to provide the hotel with a company credit card to post for this up front. If they really want you there they will figure out a way to help you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re not comfortable saying “I can’t afford this”, maybe a little white lie is in order. You’ve lost your main credit card, and a replacement won’t come in time for the trip, and ask what can they do to help you. I think honesty is the best policy here but I know not everyone is comfortable talking about money or lack there of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If travel will be a semi regular thing, you should get a credit card that you use for this. Only use it for work trips and pay it off as soon as you get reimbursed. If need be use it periodically to keep it active but don’t put yourself in debt. That way you always have a funds for travel. If you’re in a situation with bad credit and can’t get a card or just don’t want to, see if getting a company credit card is an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
