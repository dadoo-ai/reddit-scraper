    "communityName": "r/roomba",

    "body": "After having my i7 for nearly 2 years, I decided to change the roller brushes (I know way overdue). I ordered a pair from the iRobot store (purchasing the ones that said they were compatible with my model). However, when they arrived it was a very snug fit. When my iRobot ran it would stop every 1-2 mins and say the brushes were stuck. At this point, I noticed after measuring that the new rollers were ever so slightly bigger than my previous roller brushes that had come with my i7. So, I reached out for support.\n\nAfter waiting 1.5 weeks for a response (the email said their SLA was 2 days), support informed me that the brush design has changed and is no longer compatible with the legacy i7s.\n\nThey first offered to send me a single pair of older roller brushes for free if they could find them in the warehouse. While this was a nice gesture, this does not solve the problem long term, because the same issue is going to arise the next time I need to replace the roller brushes.\n\nAfter pushing back, they understood and said they would be willing to offer me a 20% discount on a new cleaning unit that would work with new rollers after I purchased it at full price and offered receipt proof.\n\nI am baffled. I spent hundreds of dollars on a vacuum from iRobot, for the design to be changed just 2 years later to the point where I can no longer use replacement roller brushes without first paying for a new cleaning head unit (I guess it would at least be discounted).\n\nI would think the reasonable solution would be to either:\n\n1. Sell the legacy brush rollers for previously manufactured i7s in addition to the new brushes for newer manufactured i7s for the duration of the typical product lifecycle (have a phase-out period)\n2. Send the cleaning unit free of charge to customers who request it so they can order the new brush rollers\n\nI have tried ordering multiple brush rollers from off-brands on Amazon and they were quick to clone the new design so they have the same issues.\n\nInterested to see how iRobot replies to my last email and if they will make it right.  \n\n\nSomeone please tell me support is off their rockers and this is not truly a product design change. Anyone else experiencing this?\n\nUPDATE: Support has responded and they will be sending me a cleaning head unit free of charge. They made it clear however that this was a special circumstance given my robot was out of warranty (it’s barely 2 years old). Glad iRobot made it right. ",

I could use some help confirming the approach as I have never done something of this scale before and its a lot of money. Please provide feedback, tweaks, or entirely different setups! I am open to suggestion and feeling a but overwhelmed. \n\n**Buildings/Area:**\n\n* Main Home - 2800 sq ft. estimated\n* \"Guest House\" - 600 sq ft. estimate\n* Barn/Workshop -  2,400 sq ft. estimate\n* Grain Bins \n\nRequirements by building below:\n\n1. **Main House**\n   1. Will act as the backbone of the network\n   2. Will need to provide a live video feed for security on the farm (we have someone sabotaging the farm, that is a long story)\n   3. Will need to store the video feed for at least the last 30 days\n   4. Would like a video doorbell - preferably not wired\n   5. Needs an access point for wireless internet access\n   6. Does not require wired access for a computer\n   7. Equipment I am thinking:\n      1. UDM-Pro - just using the built-in switch I think, at least for now\n      2. Building-to-Building Bridge XG (1st bridge) - get internet out to the barn\n      3. Network Video Recorder - 30 days video\n      4. Protect Viewport - viewing live feed while working in office\n      5. AP U6 Mesh - think this is enough for the house given its a two-story and most of the time is spent downstairs (downstairs is roughly 1500 sq ft.)\n2. **\"Guest House\"**\n   1. Is approximately 85 feet away from the Main House\n   2. Prefer wireless access from the main house but an option to have a switch and plug-in\n   3. No cameras at this time\n   4. Equipment I am thinking:\n      1. AP U6 Mesh - grab signal from the main house\n3. **Barn/Workshop**\n   1. Will be where most of the security takes place with two cameras at least\n   2. Is about 215 feet from the main house\n   3. Considering a bridge to bridge to grab the internet from the house without cable (crossing a road)\n   4. Equipment I am thinking:\n      1. Building-to-Building Bridge XG (1st bridge)\n      2. Switch Flex plugged into the Bridge\n      3. Two G5s coming out from the switch to monitor both sides of the barn and capture a good portion of the land\n      4. Not really sure what AP to do out here given the size...am I getting into UISP territory here? Perhaps x2 U6 Long Ranges\n4. **Grain Bins**\n   1. Needs wireless access as we plan to install remote monitoring within the bins in the future - this requires wireless access\n   2. The bins are about 120ft from the barn\n   3. There is an electrical building out at the grain bins so we do have some options there\n   4. Equipment I am thinking:\n      1. Some sort of mesh like the AP U6 that was used for the guest house\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Main House Backbone with Reference to Barn and \\\\\"Guest House\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/jd5aipe54m1c1.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=561e31db1daeebadbd1aa72d0056aff8415bfef9)\n\n[Coverage Map](https://preview.redd.it/ua0noa8y6m1c1.png?width=2174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ca3332930e4716179c338790d53338884cbd982)",

I refresh the app and my seat assignment for 1D disappears and has a hash. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worried, I approach the gate and the gate attendant informs me all passengers not checked in 30 minutes prior to departure are removed and upgrade list takes priority.  I promise her I checked in as this is a layover and security wouldn’t have ever let me through had i not been a ticked and confirmed passenger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously flustered she demands my ID and rebooks me. I am firmly reminded to check into my flight in the future as she forcefully hands me my id and printed boarding pass (still for 1D thankfully).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She then suggests I take a seat until they are ready for first class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I do something wrong here? I’m fairly certain I checked in as I completed my first leg already. Was she just having a bad day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: meant GA in the title.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Long story short...now in overseed season I decided after having a patio put in it was time to patch the bare spots from the construction equipment (it was blazing hot when they tried to repair on their way out, all the seedlings died at that time). You all did a wonderful job advising me to simply nuke where they had put down topsoil full of weeds and do it the right way when the temperatures got cooler since im in 5b.\n\nLast Saturday, the wife and I did the following:\n\n1.

Not sure how to fix. Northern Indiana, Zone 5b, KBG. \n\nEssentially, back in April we had a beautiful paver patio put in. This of course required a bobcat to drive in daily. The daily bobcat trekking through our yard coupled with a few April rains caused huge ruts in our yard. The landscapers said they would repair the yard on the way out of the property when the patio was complete. Sure enough they did \"repair\" it. They brought in over 5 tons of topsoil to level and repair the ruts. They then took grass seed and sprinkled it up and down the areas they repaired with what looks like blue crumbles. They told me to water frequently for the first few weeks and that the blue crumbles would help the grass establish. I did as followed and nothing really happened for a few weeks. We got some heavy rains for almost a week straight and then grass starting coming in! However, as we got into summer we got terrible heat waves. Most of the little seedlings just couldnt tough it with such shallow roots. Now, all that remains is the weed seed they had in their seed mix. I have a Melnor sprinkler system that runs for 45 mins every 2 days to keep my yard watered. At this point, I am not sure if I should just nuke the areas where they repaired, and start fresh when I overseed this fall - just hit that area with more seed than the rest and a blanket of straw? The same company also does lawn treatment, should I just tell him to hit that area hard when he does the next treatment to get rid of the weeds and proceed with overseeding?\n\nUPDATE: I have nuked the previous construction zone.

Can anyone tell me the difference between the two burrs and if the M3 burrs were a noticeable improvement over the M2 burrs?

When I make it at home though it has more of a paper taste and is less sour as the one at the shop. I do a 1:15 ratio and water is 205 degrees Fahrenheit. Grind size is finer (I only have a blade grinder, I know it’s a capital crime I’m saving up). I have been using a pour over, but I have also tried French press and aeropress. I have tried make the grind size more coarse and lowering the water temperature to decrease the extraction so it is more sour, but instead I just get a weak cup. I have some third wave water stuff on the way so I’m not using tap. How do I get a more sour cup like at the shop without making a weak cup? Could it just be a combination of the water and the grind size making such a big difference? Thanks!",

Take the risk, replace the card, and then sell the iMac and net the remaining value: $365-$665, use the netted amount to put towards a mac mini for the kiosk, I already have an external monitor and peripherals. I could also take this opportunity to put OS X server on it and begin using netboot at our company.\n\nB. Junk the iMac and take the loss. I am currently using a MBA and external monitor to play as kiosk. \n\nC. Replace the card for roughly $635 and keep using the 5 year old iMac. \n\nD. Sell the iMac as is, and reduce the graphics card cost from the re-sell value: attempt to sell for: $365-$665. This would be a hard sell IMO due to the graphics card.

We have plenty of water to drink -- even the water in our toilets is clean!\n\nBut many people around the world don’t have that luxury. 663 million people currently lack access to clean water.
