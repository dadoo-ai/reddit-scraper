I just hope they don’t go through re-branding exercise every year for this product like they did with the BI product that is now called CRM Analytics.\n\nThe presentation by Janani Narayanan touched upon the capabilities of the product before providing a glimpse into how Salesforce uses the product. The key points of the product can be seen in this video published by Salesforce last year as well.\n\nThe key functionalities I felt were:\n\nOut of the box connectors to pull in data from different systems.\nIngestion APIs to push data into Data Cloud from other systems.\nVisual UI for creating mapping and rules to arrive at a golden record.\nAbility to output this data into Marketing Cloud for segmentation and marketing journey rules.\nAbility to leverage this golden record in reporting.\n\nOne of the points that came up while discussing with a colleague was who the target will be for this solution, as a lot of the bigger enterprise customers would already have an MDM solution in place to take care of these functionalities.\n\nMy take was that this solution would suit those 1% clients who have the budget for a large solution such as this one and does not have an MDM solution in place; or is looking to shift away from a legacy MDM solution for any reason.\n\nThe close integration with Marketing Cloud is a good selling point, but I don’t have hands-on with this integration and hence do not know the edge cases and how pronounced they might be.\n\nLimits &amp; Pricing\n\nPricing is the area I was most curious on and I could not find any more than I could find online. From what I could gather this could cost upwards of $100k/year with additional cost for additional ‘Data Service Credits’ that you might need.\n\nWhile the platform itself offers 5TB of storage to get started, it also comes up with 10 million ‘Data Services Credits’. These credits cover the compute and processing related services available as part of Data Cloud.\n\nI don’t have clarity as yet on how these credits translate to what volume of data that is processed.\n\nThe limits are itself are documented on Salesforce Help.\n\nConclusion\nSalesforce CDP has been around for a while now and it should have matured a bit, especially since Salesforce are themselves using it internally. This is part that gives me hope for the product as this would guarantee continued enhancement and fewer breaking changes.\n\nThe part that is bound to confuse everyone is the costing and this obfuscation with ‘Data Services Credits’ which need a rethink.

    "body": "\n**Restriction Rules For Sharing**\n\nThe best practice for sharing data in Salesforce has been to provide the most basic permissions required at profile and object level and then figure out how to provide more to people who needed more as there was no way to take away data access permissions on an exceptional basis; until now. With Restriction rules you can set an arbitrary exception to a criteria of data and the side effect of this will be an increase in sharing complexity.\n\nI will think twice before implementing this in bigger orgs with already complicated sharing calculations to avoid any major overheads at system level. This is a great feature on paper, but I would urge everyone to exercise a lot of caution with this due to the implications it has.\n\n**Sharing Rule For Products**\n\nThis is yet another legacy limitation that has been taken away and we can now set visibility for Products and share it at a more granular level as opposed to adopting hacks to show and hide products and their details among users in the system.\n\n**Dynamic Gauges**\n\nI have never been a fan of hard-coding things and due to this reason I have avoided gauge charts in Salesforce Dashboards as much as possible. That is changing for good now with an option to set dynamic values which would make this chart actually useful beyond sales demoes. That said, I haven’t seen it in my pre-release org as yet as features are still being gradully rolled out for testing.\n\n**Hierarchial roll-ups**\n\nThis is for Einstein Analytics aka Tableau CRM. Rolling up values to create different summaries were not always simple in Data Prep. It has now been updated to work as everyone expects it to work. The value now rolls-up to different levels if the data is being summarised at multiple levels.\n\n**Salesforce Functions**\n\nFunctions is finally GA, but I still don’t know what the pircing implication will be for this feature which will let you create custom code that might require more compute than what Salesforce generally offers. The fallback has always been to create an external service in AWS or Heroku and invoke them via API, but this led to consuming of other limits such as the one for callout. Based on the documentation, my guess is that it is being powered by Heroku.\n\n**Clamp Down on Browser Extensions**\n\nApparently CORS could now be used to clampdown on access to Salesforce APIs by browser extensions. This is a big one from an enterprise security perspective. Do note that this is whitelist and extensions not on the list will not be be able to request resources. My reading is that this will affect use of browser extensions like Salesforce Inspector.\n\n**Custom values in Forecast Categories**\n\nThe default values available in Forecast Categories made little sense for most industries and their sales processes. So this change that lets you change the existing values and even add new ones is a big improvement in terms of onboarding customers to a platform. There are still a lot of these rigid parts of Salesforce sometimes adds friction in Salesforce setup and I’m happy to see that list grow shorter with each release.\n\n**New Product Alert: Workforce Management**\n\nA lot of companies have their entire support and field service teams on Salesforce, but there is no easy way to understand how the teams are aligned from an availability perspective or how evenly the work is distributed without going down the route of custom development. Omni-Supervisor view provides a good snapshot for the moment, but it doesn’t capture trends and what-if analysis that is required by staffing teams. That is the context for this product and it will be an additional purchase listed at $50/user/month (ouch).\n\n\n**Salesforce Data Pipeline changes**\n\nAn ETL tool within Salesforce has always sounded too crazy to be true and we finally received it in the last release in the form of Salesforce Data Pipeline. This release has made the process of setting up connections required for this much simpler. I’m yet to work in a project that is using this though.\n\n**Start Preparing For MFA Changes**\nMuli-Factor Authentication is going to become mandatory going forward so please start preparing for this change. If you’re using SSO then start looking at what MFA tools are supported by your SSO provider. This is a very important change from your security purpose and should not be ignored.\n\n\n**Salesforce Industries**\n\nPay a lot of attention to the products that come under Salesforce Industries. A lot of the functionality here will be the key to implementations in the future. Think of the them as Flow on steroids. I will write separately about this.\n\n**Easier B2B Commerce**\n\nSetting up B2B commerce site is now like setting up a regular community and I wish B2C has this capability sooner or later as well.\n\n\nLink to the OG post\nhttps://balanarayan.com/2021/08/24/winter-22-release-notes-what-i-liked/",

Use your favorite dev tools to create Lightning web components using standard HTML, modern JavaScript, and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lightning web components and Aura components can work together in the same app. If you decide to migrate, you can do it incrementally, one component at a time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lightning Web Components is an implementation of the Web Components standards. It supports the parts of Web Components that perform well in browsers. It adds only what’s needed for Lightning web components to work in all browsers supported by Salesforce. LWC also includes features that make it easy to build custom apps and pages on the Salesforce platform. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Spring ’19, Lightning web components run in Lightning Experience, Lightning Communities, and the Salesforce mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s to some added confusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "Here are a few features that I noticed from Summer 18 launch. Action list is what I find to be most promising\n\n**Action list**\n\nSalesforce hints at a lot of features much before they are released. I did not expect this.\n\nAction list lets you define a set of flows that need to be run against a record. There is a path on a record that defines the different stages of a record and there are workflows/process builders and flows that let you go from stage a&gt;b. Action list lets you see all the steps of the process that are being undertaken. This could be used in scenarios such as customer onboarding, loan processing, process closure and even for call scripting.\n\nThis is helpful in scenarios where there are multiple actions that are running in parallel as part of a process.\n\nYou can add flows manually or automatically from a process builder. I like this very much.\n\n**Tasks list view**\n\nTasks tab just displayed tasks as a checklist. This works at a very very very basic level. However tasks are used in a nuanced manner by a lot of Salesforce customers. Having tasks as a tab offers more flexibility that earlier.\n\n**Send list email from within campaigns!**\n\nIf you have used Campaign object in Salesforce you must has wondered why it is not possible to send mass emails from a Campaign record itself. This logical misgiving has been resolved. Finally!\n\n**New search bar**\n\nSearch bar now lets you search directly in the tabs accessible within an app instead of having to filter down to it after searching for a keyword. By default ‘Top results’ is selected.\n\n**Report enhancements**\nLightning report builder is now enabled by default. You can still use the classic one if it suits you.\n\nLightning report builder now lets you group dates on the basis week, month, quarter, year etc\n\nExport Print View has been added in lightning under a new name. When you try to export a report you will get these two options. Selecting Formatted Report will give you an Excel file that looks just like the report within Salesforce.\n\n**Prioritize rendering of components in community**\n\nI don’t remember seeing this earlier. You can now prioritize the components that need to be rendered first within a community. This will help address some of the performance issues that have been highlighted about Lightning Community templates.\n\nSalesforce has also added a Guided setup within the community.\n\n**Libraries are in lightning**\n\nLibraries are useful to store files that might need to be shared internally and externally. It is also better to manage than just folders. It is now possible to create and edit libraries; add or remove files from libraries in\n\nOverall this release looks interesting. My only hope is that new features don’t come with a lot of caveats.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@chupchap/salesforce-summer-18-features-to-watch-out-for-pre-release-notes-edition-389a476c747f\n",
