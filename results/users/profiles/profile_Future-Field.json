They&amp;#39;ve hugged my babies and I have no idea what they&amp;#39;ll feel like afterwards. Silly, I know, but that&amp;#39;s the space I&amp;#39;m in. So many on here don&amp;#39;t have time or choice to debate their options (realistically neither do I ... but I have time I think)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I started out with Semaglutide.  Weight loss was extremely slow. I suffered from a whole lot of heartburn, nausea, constipation and threw up brushing my teeth. I stuck it out a few months. Don't recall how long. It wasn't fun. \n\nSwitched to Tirzepatide and things got better. No heartburn. Improved weight-loss. I wasn't aggressive about losing and happily hovered above my goal weight for several months.  I wanted to take it slow. I went on maintenance. Then as the hunger symptoms returned, I kept up my efforts to maintain on a lower dose but eventually did start to ramp back up. \n\nI've been on 10mg for 2 months now or maybe this is the third. But now, I wonder if something is wrong. \n\nI'm finally near my goal weight. But I've suddenly developed burps,  diahorrea (the very bad kind), becoming gassy. The symptoms came on very suddenly. \n\nI've read that folks develop these symptoms early on in their glp1 journey but mine seem to be so late into it and  suddenly started out of the blue.\n\nI've been taking GasX and Pepcid. They've made the burps less extreme but still there and the diahorrea is still there too. \n\nI have work travel coming up and presentations- I'm really worried about what to do.\n\nFreaking out that something has broken :(\n\nAny folks had a similar experience of very late onset of similar symptoms, and found relief??\n\nTLDR; Sudden onset of byros, diahorrea, gas. Could I have developed a problem with an organ involved in the digestive flow? Need advice.",
