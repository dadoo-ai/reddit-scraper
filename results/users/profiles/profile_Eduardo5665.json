I downloaded [Salesforce Mobil App from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.salesforce.chatter&amp;hl=es_419&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1) ;\n2. I logged with my credentials to a Production Org (Enterprise Editions);\n3. From a dummy Account, clicked a dummy Contact and clicked on \"More\" (three dots);\n4. I select \"New Task\" (hoping to find a button to send emails but did not);\n\nConclusion: there is not button to send Emails from the Salesforce Mobile App.\n\nContext: On [Salesforce.com](https://Salesforce.com) UI seen with a browser, we have a button to send emails from the Activity timeline. This button opens a little window with all the expected fields/tools to send an email to the Contact (including Rich Text setup tools such as bold, underline, etc.)\n\nCan this feature (to send emails) be included in Salesforce Mobile App?\n\nIt is obviously possible to directly click on the email address on the SF Mobile app and let this invoke the default email app installed on the phone... and send an email from there but the issue is that the email will not be stored in Salesforce (only in the email app).\n\nI know it is possible to send emails from the mobile App \"Salesforce Inbox\" (which seems like a winner for its features) with a price tag of 25 USD/User/Month but, the question is: **is there a way to send emails from Salesforce Mobile app** (to avoid paying additional amounts for licenses?)\n\nIf not, is there another option to be considered before paying the above price?\n\nThank you.",

After doing it twice, eventually, the third time your client is very likely to trust you. \n\nMake your resumé shine on LinkedIn.\n(Optional) Consider having an ultra-simple Web page where anyone interested in you can EASILY contact you. Remember that \"super-simple\" does not mean mediocre, make sure it's clean, clear, to the point, professional... like the Pro you are.\n\nTarget your chosen audience, plan your tactical actions to contact them from UK, perform a small survey to discover how much are your potential clients likely to pay you and leverage this opportunity (survey) to break the ice, let them hear your voice and educated manners.\n\nBased on your survey results, adjust your target audience and tactical action to be visible and accessible.
