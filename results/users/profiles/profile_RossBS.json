The league struggles in a handful of places. Inexperienced coaches, poor communication around the league (rec league has 6+ teams in minors, 6+ in majors), typical board politics...etc etc etc.\n\nThese rec teams are the pipeline for the tourny teams. Unfortunately, it feels like these teams are so focused on winning the micro battles, that it's becoming a detriment to the health of the league and success of the players.\n\nAn example - Catchers do not attempt to throw out base runners. Ever. Because coaches aren't proficient enough to work with kids on specific fundamentals - covering bases, backing up the throw, etc - coaches have universally told kids in the league to NOT attempt to throw out a potential steal, because they don't want the kids to throw the ball around the field and gift runs. This season, every walk or single was essentially a triple within 2 pitches of reaching base. \n\nThe ramifications are obvious. Baserunners simply jog to bases and don't learn proper baserunning or sliding. Catchers don't know how to throw down. Nobody knows how to cover. The major and minor league teams entered tournaments this week and it went predictably. Kids stretching walks into doubles because nobody knew what to do. Our kids refusing to steal for the first several innings as they were puzzled by a catcher trying to throw them out.\n\nThis kind of prioritization - baserunners/gifting runs is more important than proper coaching and fundamentals - has really hampered the kids. Have other people run into this? I've heard that some larger towns/cities implement a \"no advance on catcher throwing error\" rule for rec teams like this. It's not ideal to limit kids from advancing on a wild throw, but it greatly encourages teams to attempt the right play. \n\nI'd love to hear if anyone has experience with a challenge like this or any ideas how to approach it. While it's just a rec league, board members, parents, and coaches all agree that they want to become a more competent organization.

Before you choose to leave, you need to let her know this is an issue and give her a chance to be better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was wrong, but It also sounds like you&amp;#39;re a bit of an immature asshole. You obviously didn&amp;#39;t discuss purchasing this - a $500 investment - with your wife. You have a 7 month old kid, and I guarantee there&amp;#39;s about a million other things you could use that money on for your house, savings, kid, etc...but if it WAS that important to get your little Nintendo toy, then you should have discussed it with your wife and explained why. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t hers to give away, but you&amp;#39;re talking about running out on your wife and kids and using the switch as an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Im going to say something that sounds really simple and dumb, but it contributes alot to kids rolling over on the ball (which your kid is doing): He should line up his knuckles.\n\nAs he gets older, if he wants to loosen up the grip, that's fine. But if hes rolling over the ball, having him line up his knuckles - the knuckles you use to knock on a door, not the knuckles you use when punching - might be the first (and easiest) place to adjust. \n\nLining your \"knocking\" knuckles up opens up the wrists and allows more bat whip through the zone. More importantly for him, it allows for a smooth rotation instead of having tight wrists that force him to roll over on the ball too early. \n\nI agree that he should try to be a little more inside on the ball, but alot of his swing looks good.

My kids have never seen me cry, but I probably cry from crap like the above once every few weeks. Not blubbering, but just tears flowing while I watch something. Keeps me from bubbling over in other situations. \n\nSo, figure out why you're crying. Is it because you're like me?
