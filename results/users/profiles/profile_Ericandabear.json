My friend has heart issues and has been the ER a few times to be certain chest pain wasn't indicative of something life threatening. If they had known about this mass, they'd have been monitoring it, and certainly would have checked again sooner than 4 years later. Their primary care physician also had no knowledge of this. The radiologist gave their condolences, as did the rest of the hospital staff.  \nIs it possible that this person is a rogue radiologist that is simply misreading the chart? Of course my friend is taking all of the necessary steps- appointments with a pulmonologist and a lung biopsy are already scheduled. If this was legitimately found four years ago and not brought to their attention, is something like this worth legal recourse?

No dice necessary, no stats, no fog, etc... This is probably for a one-time use, so I don't want anyone to have pay for it or download a lot of software, and because of that, pen and paper is one of my considerations. Another being some kind of \"PDF+MS Paint\" combo, but again I'm not sure all of the players have the same software available.  \nAre there options available for simply putting tokens on a map and being able to move them around? So far I have been unable to find any.  \nThanks!",

He wants a homebrew spell, item, or feature that will allow him to essentially hurt himself with his casting crystal for a boost in spellcasting dicerolls. His and my inexperience has given us some trouble trying to balance it so it isn't overpowered at his current level 2, but also won't be useless as he levels up.\n\nOne of the ideas we had was to simply activate this feature/spell when he is half HP, and then double the number of dicerolls for any spell cast. His only damaging spell currently is Firebolt, so he'd go from 10 to 5 hp, and then from 1d10 to 2d10 damage rolls. This seems to work out when he's higher level (level 8 would mean 2d10 to 4d10 for firebolt).\n\nDoes this work with how spells should be written? Are the dice correct?

They did, however, leave us only the captain wave, and just as we cleared the captain, the PL10 brig decided they wanted the treasure. We grabbed the key, hopped on the sloup and sailed away just in time for harpoons to connect to the rear of the ship, and started blasting us with cannons. My partner usually does the boarding, and he recognized quickly they were all skilled beyond the first brig and boarding wasn't an option.\n\nSuddenly the ocean turned black and we thought \"alright, we're doomed.\" It grabbed the PL10's however, just as we were passing Plunder Valley. My partner grabbed the key and took off in the water to hide it on Plunder, but was sharked to death on the way. I started circling the boat and hopped off to grab it, but couldnt find it! I jumped back on the boat and he found it after spawning, ran inland and hid the key in the caves amongst the glowing mushrooms.\n\nI had the idea at that point to return to the fort in attempt to trick them into thinking we were opening the door. The didnt believe us, and after they left the kraken ink, slowly floated around Plunder, we assume searching for the key.\nWe loaded a few barrels and supplies on the boat, worrying that it would deshawn before we got to it, and before long we saw the brig B-lining towards the fort. Again we hopped on the boat to escape and again they caught us quickly, wow the brig is fast! One of them is a crack shot too, killed me with a single sniper shot in the water as I boarded them.\n\nI was able to anchor turn and avoid them for a moment, and we started heading north to Golden Sands, still pretending we had opened the door. They had bought it, never checked us once!\n\nWe made it to Golden Sands just as they caught us, we jumped off holding wood planks and they focused our boat. After a few minutes we scuttled and waved to them, and grabbed a mermaid as they docked at the outpost to check us out.\n\nWe spawned at an island down south, found a mermaid gem and a rowboat (score!) and headed to Plunder Outpost, where we changed all of our cosmetics and titles. I then sailed north west to Plunder Valley, dropped my partner in the row and headed to dock at Wanderers Refuge, keeping an eye on our brig rivals up north, and a rogue sloup sailing around the fishing outpost.\n\nMy partner grabbed the key and began his way to the fort, where I planned to rendezvous, but sure enough this lunatic fisherman on the sloup begins hassling me, insisting I let him on to check my barrels for rare fish. Not happening bud, even if I dont have a single fish. He gets on and heads to the barrels, where he is killed, and declares war. I battle him solo for the next 20 minutes, and admittedly he's a better PvPer. I moved recently to PC and a lot of the keys aren't natural to me yet, particularly loading cannons and grabbing supplies. He puts my ship into bad enough shape, comes and checks the barrels, and oddly enough helps me save the boat, ha! Mind you, I am disguised as a new player with the hungering one titled, so maybe a little pity was given. He says \"I would've killed me too, honestly,\" and sails away.

We grabbed a few chests that hadn't been hidden and scooted.\nMy buddy stayed on the island, and I sailed away, whilst they shot boarders toward me. I heard the water-emerging sound as one seemingly hit the ladder, but I saw no one. I went to the ladders on both sides as far as I could, stood on the front and on the back of the sloup to see the ladders, but could see nobody there.\nEventually I deemed it clear and repaired the one hole I'd suffered from the island's cannon, and as soon as I hit the hammer I heard the anchor drop. The brig caught up and I was killed, ship sank, and we lost the 6 or so chests I'd stashed from doing riddles.
