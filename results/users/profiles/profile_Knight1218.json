    "body": "Hello. This kind of post probably comes up fairly often here but I'm looking for some help from specialists, especially considering I have a decade old machine and have 0 experience using any of the newer models.\n\nSo as the title mentions, I have a MacBook Pro 15-inch Mid-2014 (2.2 GHz Intel Core i7). I've had it for over a decade and last year, its battery finally gave up so I got a replacement just to get it running again. In college, I used it pretty heavily - Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, etc. - but in the last few years it's become too old and slow to run those programs (and anyway, I hardly use them now). The problem is I can't upgrade it to any of the lates OS and the webcam has been busted for years and the speakers are 'broken' for a lack of better term. Have taken care of this machine fairly well otherwise and while I can still use it, I really think it's time for an upgrade.\n\nMy day-to-day use will be streaming (movies, TV shows, etc.) , a little bit of video editing, and some basic coding (Python, Java, etc.) - just getting into this so the use won't be super heavy. My budget is flexible but ideally between CAD 2k-2.5k (based in Canada). \n\nQuestion(s): I can't decide between the Air and Pro. I'm used to the 15-inch screen but I think the 14-inch Pro wouldn't be a big difference? The latest models (M4) all come with 16 GB RAM I believe so not too worried about that. Would ideally like to go for at least 512 GB SSD. Based on this info, what would people here recommend? From back in the day, I recall the Air being a little too weak to run heavier programs/software but that's probably not the case now? I don't think my use case warrants going for a Pro but I'm unsure. I also plan on keeping the new machine for at least 5-7 years if not longer so that's a factor too. \n\nWould appreciate any help! Sorry for the long post and thank you!",

I've been at my current company for over 5 years and for the last 3, I've been in our Salesforce/systems team. (Worked in unrelated departments my first 2 years here.)\n\nI initially began working as an 'admin' for other platforms integrated with Salesforce. Slowly moved up to working on help desk issues for SFDC - creating users, assigning permission sets, and helping with other very non-technical issues in SFDC and other tools.\n\nOver the last 2ish years, I've grown into an SFDC admin working on smaller configurations in the beginning and now working on more advanced stuff. Got my Admin cert last year as well. However, I still don't work on complex flows or other advanced admin tasks. \n\nRecently, it seems like my company (and I feel every other company) has started focusing on developers and programmatic configurations rather than declarative. I have 0 coding background and until recently, had 0 interest in learning it as well. I understand the basics of Apex and after studying a class for 20 minutes or more I can more or less get to what it's doing. I feel like I'd be a sucky developer anyway.\n\nToday, I sort of head of one of our admin functions based on my knowledge and experience with our integrated SaaS tools. It's taken me a while to get to where I am now and I thought I can finally enjoy this for a bit but it feels like I'm in a losing race. By the time I've gotten to this stage, things across the industry seem to be more focused on dev work and admins like me are just a lost cause. We use CPQ as well but I have very limited knowledge there.\n\nI have a supportive manager (initially pulled me into his team) who has been open with me about my options and generally supports me regardless. I don't know if I want to move towards a BA or PM role or stay where I am and strive to learn some code and/or try specializing within an SFDC product/domain to become a better admin.\n\nAs a 'non-technical' tech employee I feel like a lost cause and feel like I'm winging it everyday. I do have somewhat above average soft skills and I'm good with certain things like stakeholder management but when I look at the teams around me, I feel like I don't deserve to be there. I'll admit one of my primary motivations for staying in this industry is financial. That and maybe seeing some potential in myself to learn and be better.\n\nIf I am to learn coding and move into that direction, I need to start from scratch. I also know I can't learn that myself online (have tried it on other occasions) - I'd need proper classes. Is it worth looking into going back to school for this (part time or diploma or something)? \n\nIf you've read this far, thanks! I'd really appreciate any advice or even just some kind words haha! Any courses (proper ones, not just self-paced online stuff like Udemy/Trailhead) that you recommend? I'm based in Canada. Should I learn CS and/or coding basics outside of SFDC? Is/has anyone been in similar situations - how do you feel about it and what did you do? Thanks all!",

From what I see, the rental market is quite bad with 1-bedroom apartments going for over $2500. \n\nI'll be working full-time remotely so I don't necessarily need to be in downtown or have any transit-specific needs but I'm looking for a safe neighborhood in a somewhat 'young' area as I'm in my 20s.\n\nI don't know if looking for a full 1 year lease is a good idea as I'm not sure if I intend to stay in Toronto long term - I'm only landing and starting here because most of the people I know in Canada are living in the GTA.\n\nI've been looking for Airbnbs as well but wanted to hear from people who might've stayed 1-2 months in one and have any opinions/recommendations. Alternatively, if there are an options for short-term leases (4-6 months), I'd love to know about them. I've looked at Facebook marketplace but haven't had much luck. Is it at all possible to find good apartments on a 6 month lease?\n\nMy budget isn't incredibly high but I'm willing to pay 2200 +/- 100 (for a 1 year lease) if the place is good, preferably rent-controlled, and has good building management and some amenities. If there are any recommendations for those, I'd appreciate if anyone can please share them.\n\nAlso looking for advice on GTA places like Vaughan, Mississauga, etc - most of the people I know live around these areas but I'm not sure if that's a good option as I won't have a car and I've heard the public transport is decent at best.\n\nI know a little about the rent-control issues with newer buildings but if anyone has lived in a new building with no rent-control, can you please share if it's worth it, especially if you're okay moving after a year and finding a different place if the rent increase is too high? \n\nSince I'm completely new, I can't quite tell the do's and don'ts. I've been looking on [Rentals.ca](https://Rentals.ca), Zumper, Kijiji, Padmapper, etc. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you :)",

Is it at all possible to find good apartments on a 6 month lease?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My budget isn&amp;#39;t incredibly high but I&amp;#39;m willing to pay 2200 +/- 100 (for a 1 year lease) if the place is good, preferably rent-controlled, and has good building management and some amenities. If there are any recommendations for those, I&amp;#39;d appreciate if anyone can please share them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also looking for advice on GTA places like Vaughan, Mississauga, etc - most of the people I know live around these areas but I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s a good option as I won&amp;#39;t have a car and I&amp;#39;ve heard the public transport is decent at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know a little about the rent-control issues with newer buildings but if anyone has lived in a new building with no rent-control, can you please share if it&amp;#39;s worth it, especially if you&amp;#39;re okay moving after a year and finding a different place if the rent increase is too high? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;m completely new, I can&amp;#39;t quite tell the do&amp;#39;s and don&amp;#39;ts. I&amp;#39;ve been looking on &lt;a href=\"https://Rentals.ca\"&gt;Rentals.ca&lt;/a&gt;, Zumper, Kijiji, Padmapper, etc. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I also don't have any major debts at the moment that need to come out of my paycheck. Since I'll be working remotely/from home, I don't have any transit-specific needs but I'll probably get a monthly Presto subscription just to make things easier.\n\nThanks for highlighting the going out/eating out costs. I'm planning on doing meal prep for weekdays (pretty used to it for a while now so should be able to do it again). I do want to go out on weekends sometimes so I guess I'll have to reconsider that budget a little. Whatever's left, I'm planning on saving or maybe investing.\n\nMy primary goal (in terms of living) is to find a place for just myself that's safe and has good building management. From the looks of things it seems a little impossible but I guess I'll get a clearer idea once I'm there. If you have any suggestions for a good rental company, please let me know! :)",
