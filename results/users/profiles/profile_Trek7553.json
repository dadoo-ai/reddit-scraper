There is no MIT study that used brain scans to find that ChatGPT weakens mental engagement, that 83% of users forgot their own writing, or that neural activity dropped by 47%. The image uses fabricated statistics and misleading stock imagery to distort the findings of a real, but unrelated, MIT study.\nDetailed Analysis\nHere is a breakdown of the claims and the reality:\n * The Claim: An MIT study using brain scans found that using ChatGPT leads to significantly reduced mental engagement, memory loss regarding one's own writing, and a sharp drop in neural activity.\n * The Reality:\n   * No Brain Scans Were Used: The actual MIT study that is likely being misrepresented did not involve brain scans (fMRI or otherwise). Fact-checking organizations like Reuters and the Associated Press have confirmed that the brain images used in the meme are generic stock images or illustrations, not data from an actual experiment. The \"ChatGPT User\" image, showing virtually no brain activity, is biologically unrealistic for a conscious person.\n   * Fabricated Statistics: The numbers \"83% forgot their own writing\" and \"neural activity dropped 47%\" are completely fabricated. These statistics do not appear in the actual MIT study or any other credible research on the topic. The claim that 83% of people \"forgot their own writing\" is particularly sensational and has no basis in fact.\n   * Misrepresentation of a Real Study: The meme appears to be a gross distortion of a real working paper from MIT researchers published in 2023, titled \"Experimental Evidence on the Productivity Effects of Generative Artificial Intelligence.\" This study looked at how ChatGPT affected the productivity of college-educated professionals in writing tasks (e.g., press releases, delicate emails).\n     * What the real study found: Instead of weakening performance, the study found that ChatGPT increased productivity. Participants completed tasks about 40% faster and the quality of their output was rated 18% higher. The tool was particularly beneficial for less-skilled workers, helping them catch up to their higher-skilled peers.\n     * What the real study did NOT find: It did not measure \"mental engagement\" or \"neural activity.\" It was a study about workplace productivity and quality of output, not a neuroscience experiment.\nConclusion\nThe image you shared is a piece of misinformation. It takes the name of a prestigious institution (MIT) and combines it with sensational but baseless statistics and misleading images to create a false narrative about the effects of using AI tools like ChatGPT. The real MIT research on the topic found that ChatGPT can be a powerful productivity tool, contrary to the claims made in the image.",

Then, we dumped a bunch of water all at once and it happened again. As soon as the water comes in large quantities, it gushes up from below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/cfQF4m9\"&gt;Pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Relevant background information:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The PVC pipe is going into a cast iron/rubber &amp;quot;boot&amp;quot; but the water is not coming out of the joint. It comes out of the dirt to the left of the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is an iron floor drain on the other side of the basement that has rotted out (I mention this as a general indicator of the age and quality of the plumbing)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The house has shifted a substantial amount over the years but is currently stable (or so the engineer told me when I bought it)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Edit: There are also fruit flies gathering which the sewer guy seemed to think was relevant.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would it be a good idea for me to buy something like &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073ZFC59R/\"&gt;this endoscope&lt;/a&gt; and share the footage here? Any other thoughts? I don&amp;#39;t know where to go from here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I called a plumber. Open to any further advice. Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit2: Pipe underground is rotted out. It has now been dug up and replaced. Water damage remediation underway. Thanks everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I'm only concerned about that initial sale for now.\n\nWhat is the best way to show conversion rates over time? I can't do it based on the sale date, since potential customers (by definition) don't have a sale date. I also don't want to compare the monthly sales to the entire pool of potential customers for a conversion rate, because some of them are years old and are not active leads anymore. I could do some sort of rolling date range for when a lead is considered active, but that seems imperfect since an inactive lead could still theoretically become a sale.\n\nAny tips or examples of how other people have handled this? I'm looking for best practices or examples from any industry that I can bring to the table to get ideas flowing. Thanks!",

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am doing a project where I have split a group of students into test and control groups. The test group will receive a certain intervention from their advisor and the control group will not. I am measuring the outcome as a binary pass/fail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I plan to use chi squared to compare the test and control groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can I compare the relative difference between advisors? Some have a higher baseline failure rate, so I want to compare the improvement from baseline with that of the other advisors. I assume I could use a similar technique to determine if the intervention is more effective for males or females or any other categorical variable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am using R and am relatively new to using stats in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
