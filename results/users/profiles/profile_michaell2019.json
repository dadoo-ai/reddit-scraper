I&amp;#39;m wondering how they got it so low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the lease ends next month and I need to transfer to my name. Do I call toyota financial and tell them I want to buy the car, send them a check? I can&amp;#39;t pay in full but it&amp;#39;s easy for me to get a used car loan. Do I need to get my mom&amp;#39;s old friend involved?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Finally got in touch with my mom&amp;#39;s friend. Lease is in friend name only. TFS told friend the buy price is $13k. Seems low to me but I have no problems paying her $13k for a base 2021 corolla with 20k miles in great condition. And my mom trusts her friend to transfer the title. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
