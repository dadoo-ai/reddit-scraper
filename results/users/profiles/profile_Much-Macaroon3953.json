These records have their own unique user assignments and statuses etc to track processing. \n\nDepending on the object, sometimes users are assigned as an owner of the records.  Sometimes they are listed as a user in a lookup on the record.  Sometimes they are assigned to a queue that owns the record. \n\nThey currently manage their day to day work by looking at dashboards and reports that surface these records to be worked. It’s not intuitive as there are multiple dashboards with maxed out db tile/components that users randomly click into in order to find records to work on. \n\nI am trying to vet whether Omni can be the holy grail that can ‘serve’ up the next record the user should work on based on pre-defined business logic for prioritization.  Based on the results of that work, the record can be completed or potentially sent back to queue for re-prioritizing or assigning to different agent that is available when rules are met again. \n\nThis would need to function across multiple objects and records would need to be assigned and prioritized on the fly when a user is available - not necessarily through a record trigger. \n\nThe experience would need to be very similar to a preview Dialer - All the user needs to do is ‘click next’ and the system handles the prioritization of what to work on next.  That work may require calling or communicating with someone. It might also only require manually updating some information on a record and moving on to the next prioritized item.  \n\nI am just scratching the surface of Omni channel but the set up is a bit convoluted - esp with Omni flows.  I am unsure when those actually run.\n\nAny help or feedback here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",
