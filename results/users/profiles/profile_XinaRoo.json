    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We keep important stored items (documents, photo albums, etc.) in big plastic storage bins marked &amp;#39;evacuation&amp;#39;. And we keep extra empty ones ready. When summer starts, we move the full bins out of the attic and down to the garage, and fill the empty ones with bug-out supplies like extra pet food and supplies, water, spare clothes, our house document lockbox, extra medication, N95 masks, spare batteries, flashlight, work gloves, first aid kit, spare house and car keys, cash - we have a packing list adapted from the ones we found online. All those bins clearly marked for evacuation live in the garage, ready to go if needed. We can bug out really quickly. It works well for us - we&amp;#39;ve been evacuated in 2017, 2019, and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Their house is a cat temple, including a giant catio that used to be their deck and is now mostly enclosed for cat enjoyment. A few weeks ago they found a stray kitten, maybe 5 months old, in their yard. Of course, they decided she should join the family.\n\nShe’s extremely affectionate, outgoing, and just a general love bug. But she’s also an escape artist. She can’t be allowed on the catio that easily contains her siblings, because she busts out immediately. She got loose this morning and didn’t return until after 9pm. Dad has reinforced the catio with every possible block - netting, pigeon spikes, 6ft tall gating - and she’s out in moments. This morning’s escape happened when she slipped past Mom letting out another cat and trying to block her from the outside space.\n\nMy poor parents are at their wits end. They’re considering rehoming her and it’s breaking their hearts. Has anyone had success changing this kind of behavior? She’s due to be spayed in a week - can they expect big changes then? Just looking for some hope - they are devastated at the thought of giving her up. Cat tax attached.",

My last attempt at abortives (imitrex, maxalt) was a disaster. I felt nauseated, sweaty, and like I was going to leap out of my skin. This time I’m trying preventives.\n\nI’m starting with propranolol. And we’re starting slow. I started with 10mg once a day. The first day I felt like a total zombie. Couldn’t put two thoughts together. So, so tired. But, it faded after that day, and since I also had a migraine I blamed it on that. Week 2, I stepped up to 10 mg 2x/day. The zombie feeling has returned and doesn’t seem to be leaving.\n\nI’m scheduled to step up to 10mg 3x/day soon, and I’m afraid. Should I expect to get acclimated to this? Has propranolol affected anyone else like this? We started with this drug because of the mild side effects, but it hasn’t been my experience so far.
