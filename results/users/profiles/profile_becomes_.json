As far as I'm aware, there isn't a way to dynamically display different tab names for objects based on what app the user is in, so I'm wondering what the simplest way to achieve that would be. For example, if I'm in the Sales app, I might want the Accounts tab to say \"Accounts,\" but in a different lightning app, I might want a different label.\n\nUnderstanding that this is a \"nice to have,\" and may not be worth doing, does anyone have experience with this use case, and how would you go about solving it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

    "body": "Hi, Salesforce SE here- this is not accurate. While it is accurate that copilot functionality is moving to and being rebranded under Agentforce, Agentforce itself is absolutely not a rebrand of copilot. The underlying architecture is completely different, and is significantly more complex than what Copilot was. I think it was always the intention to get to this place, but the original copilot, in my opinion, was a bit lackluster. Agentforce is significantly more capable, and copilot is merely being moved onto this new architecture. I think copilot is now probably about 25% of Agentforce. \n\nFunctionally, Copilot could only really work as an assistant to a human agent/employee. Agentforce agents can be customer/externally facing and work nearly completely autonomously in addition to being able to assist employees.

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, Salesforce SE here- this is not accurate. While it is accurate that copilot functionality is moving to and being rebranded under Agentforce, Agentforce itself is absolutely not a rebrand of copilot. The underlying architecture is completely different, and is significantly more complex than what Copilot was. I think it was always the intention to get to this place, but the original copilot, in my opinion, was a bit lackluster. Agentforce is significantly more capable, and copilot is merely being moved onto this new architecture. I think copilot is now probably about 25% of Agentforce. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Functionally, Copilot could only really work as an assistant to a human agent/employee.
