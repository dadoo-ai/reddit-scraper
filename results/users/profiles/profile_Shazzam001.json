I was still adjusting PH to down when they laid the eggs and I was afraid to change it after that, thus I think that's why most didn't survive.\n\nAnyway I'm in week 2 of them being free swimmers, can barely see them in the plants that they like to hide in but occasionally I'll see one zip around and know I'm not wasting my time feeding brine shrimp to an empty tank.\n\nThis morning I was elated to see what I thought were two fry hanging out on the glass and pulled out my camera to photo, but nope these guys are moving around like slugs on the glass and look like some sort of amoeba.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4yfu7fqg0cw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0a9f9b21ce43453d7b2c773b6340ae79ec57e32\n\nDid some digging, is this *planaria* or *rhabdocoela* ?\n\nThey don't seem to have an arrow shapped head that this page suggests is the tell tale sign:[https://fishlab.com/planaria/](https://fishlab.com/planaria/)\n\nThey must have come from my main tank although I've never seen them in the main tank before that's been established with nothing new for over 6 months now (last thing to arrive were a batch of mystery snails).\n\nMy naked eye could only see the two but in the photo I'm shocked to see there's like 20 alone in my zoomed in photo!\n\nAre my fry doomed?   If they're rhabdocoela do I nuke them in both tanks or are they safe to keep?\n\nThanks for the help all mighty fish lore kings, I'd like to save my water babies if I can!  \n\n\nUpdate:  \nFor some reason the photo wasn't added to the story and a photo from the linked website showed instead.   The website photo was clearly *planaria* but I'm guessing it's *rhabdocoela* in my photo.  \n\n\nUpdate #2:  \nSo yeah, now that I'm looking closely I'm pretty sure there's also hydra floating around.   I have to think that both of these parasites are present in my 90 gallon tank and I've just not noticed them before.    It's going to suck getting rid of them, and it sounds like the fry are indeed doomed.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, so quick back story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My angels were laying eggs so I setup a breeding tank and was able to get maybe 20 fry out of 200 some odd eggs.  I was still adjusting PH to down when they laid the eggs and I was afraid to change it after that, thus I think that&amp;#39;s why most didn&amp;#39;t survive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway I&amp;#39;m in week 2 of them being free swimmers, can barely see them in the plants that they like to hide in but occasionally I&amp;#39;ll see one zip around and know I&amp;#39;m not wasting my time feeding brine shrimp to an empty tank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning I was elated to see what I thought were two fry hanging out on the glass and pulled out my camera to photo, but nope these guys are moving around like slugs on the glass and look like some sort of amoeba.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4yfu7fqg0cw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a0a9f9b21ce43453d7b2c773b6340ae79ec57e32\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4yfu7fqg0cw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a0a9f9b21ce43453d7b2c773b6340ae79ec57e32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did some digging, is this &lt;em&gt;planaria&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;rhabdocoela&lt;/em&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t seem to have an arrow shapped head that this page suggests is the tell tale sign:&lt;a href=\"https://fishlab.com/planaria/\"&gt;https://fishlab.com/planaria/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They must have come from my main tank although I&amp;#39;ve never seen them in the main tank before that&amp;#39;s been established with nothing new for over 6 months now (last thing to arrive were a batch of mystery snails).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My naked eye could only see the two but in the photo I&amp;#39;m shocked to see there&amp;#39;s like 20 alone in my zoomed in photo!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are my fry doomed?   If they&amp;#39;re rhabdocoela do I nuke them in both tanks or are they safe to keep?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the help all mighty fish lore kings, I&amp;#39;d like to save my water babies if I can!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;br/&gt;\nFor some reason the photo wasn&amp;#39;t added to the story and a photo from the linked website showed instead.   The website photo was clearly &lt;em&gt;planaria&lt;/em&gt; but I&amp;#39;m guessing it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;rhabdocoela&lt;/em&gt; in my photo.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update #2:&lt;br/&gt;\nSo yeah, now that I&amp;#39;m looking closely I&amp;#39;m pretty sure there&amp;#39;s also hydra floating around.   I have to think that both of these parasites are present in my 90 gallon tank and I&amp;#39;ve just not noticed them before.    It&amp;#39;s going to suck getting rid of them, and it sounds like the fry are indeed doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

After a bit of reading I just didn’t think that was going to work, I mean, I give myself major razor rash and nics almost every time I shave my neck.\n\nSo I researched electric razors and went with a nice looking razor that a review website said would be good for body grooming as my current ancient one didn’t cover that.\n\nRazor arrives a few days before the procedure and over my lunch break I’m like, let’s get er done!\n\nSo I start with the close shave and it’s doing nothing, it’s like I’m trying to mow a lawn with nail trimmers.\n\nSo I switch to the 1mm blade and am just breezing through things above my balls and feeling good, time to get the balls done, easy peasy right?\n\nSo the website said, have some lubricant: Check! \n\n(conditioner and in the shower with the water going)\n\nPull your scrote flat: Check! \n\n(ok this is getting awkward doing this and holding a razor and keeping my dick out of the way)\n\nI then carefully start mowing the lawn.\n\nIt started going OK but then my razor lurched when there was a patch that the lube had been showered off and sweet baby jesus I have an inch and a half of my balls springing blood pretty badly.\n\nI’m like shit shit shit, it hurt but I thought let's just keep going.
