    "communityName": "r/Fire",
    "parsedCommunityName": "Fire",
    "body": "Hi all, I was the newbie with $1.55 million net worth that posted in January. https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/107e0og/net_worth_155_million_looking_to_fire_in_the_next/ My wife and I have been working on evaluating this the last 2 months really thinking about everything and trying to come up with a much more specific plan and data that is accurate. \n\n\nI have those numbers in detail below. \n\n\nFirst let me say, I'm looking for any sort of feedback or advice (good or bad), but in particular any mistakes that we are still making or considerations that we haven't considered yet. Our general philosophy is to approach this in a somewhat conservative manner, but still take some risks in that we can't predict everything in the future. \n\n\n**Basic background and assumptions**: \n\n\nMarried couple 40 and 44. No kids. Washington DC based. Wife works for the federal government, I work in the private sector. We would both like to take 1 year off starting in 2025 or 2026 to travel the world. My wife would try to get a year of leave without pay (something that may be available to federal employees, note that she uses all of her vacation and sick leave already). I would quit my job. After 1 year, the expectation is that my wife wouldn't go back to work (if she is still happy not working). I would probably not take a 9 to 5 job and would only consider part-time roles (I work in tech) that allow maximum travel flexibility (I'm not sure if this qualifies as barista fire or not). Essentially, I would scale up or down work depending on what we are doing and our finances. \n\n\nWe are using the madfientist lab. Withdrawal rate 3.8%. Growth rate 6.0%. Future expenses $10,000/month (see below for an exact breakdown of this). **Current FIRE date is in 4 years.**\n\n\n**On Net Worth**\nNet Worth is $1,960,000\n\n\n1. Government Pension $300,000. We looked into this a lot and we are now assuming the pension is worth $300,000. I used this site. https://valueyourpension.com/life-expectancy-present-value-calculator/ I couldn't find a good calculator that both does FIRE analysis and considers a future pension. When I input the data, it ranges from low $300,000s to low $500,000s. I went with $300,000 while assuming that inflation is 4% in the future, and yet the pension only increases at a 2% COLA once she starts to take the pension. Since I put in the $300,000 into including it as part of net worth for FIRE on https://lab.madfientist.com/, the pension is going to grow at 6% which it actually isn't. Hence, I'm trying to put inflation at 4% and cola at 2% to counter this and be more conservative. I didn't see many writings for FIRE folks on how to account for future government pensions. \nPresent Value of Monthly Payment (assumes 3% inflation rate)$1,873\n\n2. Condo Rental $400,000. I talked to my wife about selling and just using the funds to invest in an equity ETF or even a REIT. At this time, that's a non-starter as she wants to keep the condo. Our tenants of 8 years are about to move out. It looks like we will increase the monthly rate by $200, so the new positive cashflow on the property will be about $10,000 after all expenses including some maintenance. The property is worth around $400,000, so it isn't a good yield, but she likes the idea of having a backup property near where we live. \n\n3. HSA - Added in the $11,000 for the HSA\n\n4.

Explanation on current expenses are as follows:\nHealth - I know that a lot of people rely on the ACA for the credits. I think we would use those as well, but we wanted to take this from a conservative standpoint and assume that we would have to cover Health costs without tax credits. The above number seems to be very close to expected monthly health costs if you don't get any tax credits, but you buy a plan on the ACA DC exchange. \n\nHousing - We talked quite a bit about where to live and we basically ended up staying where we currently are in DC. My wife wants to have a home base and be near her parents. I thought that maybe we could live/travel a few years overseas and give up a home in the USA and then use that money for overseas life, but that seems to be off the table. Even if we spend extended time overseas, we are going to keep our place in DC. We aren't actually allowed to sub lease out our place in DC, so we would just pay the monthly amount on it even if we didn't use it. \n\nFood - We are already mostly Aldi shoppers and don't really eat out, so I don't think there is room for saving any more money on food that would have any sort of impact. \nShopping - this is the one that had the largest variance when I looked back at annual shopping expenses from 2018 through 2022. It ranged from $2,000 to $6,000. I think $6,000 is on the higher side, but to be more conservative, we are going with this number. \n\nEntertainment - $2,500 doesn't seem like a huge expense to me. This has been pretty steady over the past few years. This has mostly been baseball game tickets and musicals/plays. \n\nAuto/Transport - We have 1 car from 2009. In DC, we mostly get around by bicycles. I don't think there are any cost savings here. We need the car for US travel and to see my wife's parents who live about 45 minutes away. \n\nDonations - $10,000. I want to assume this stays the same for the time being. \n\nTravel - $3,000. This is the one that I think is the biggest risk. We play the credit card game to get lots and lots of signup bonuses that we use for travel. In the last few years, our actual travel expense number has actually gone negative since we have been cashing out more points from Amex and Chase than we are actually spending on travel, even taking into account the credit card annual fees. This is the one that is hard to predict. It's the only one that I'm not listing in a conservative assessment, so I'm hoping that if this is wrong, shopping or the health costs being lower and buffer will cover this. \n\nBuffer - I basically added in the number to get us back to $10,000/month - of which $2,374 is the buffer. I'm thinking this covers taxes that we have to pay and anything else that is unexpected or was estimated to be incorrect. Is this number enough?\n\n\nIf you made it this far, I really appreciate it and you much be interested in the topic. Happy to answer any questions or clarify anything.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I was the newbie with $1.55 million net worth that posted in January. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/107e0og/net_worth_155_million_looking_to_fire_in_the_next/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/107e0og/net_worth_155_million_looking_to_fire_in_the_next/&lt;/a&gt; My wife and I have been working on evaluating this the last 2 months really thinking about everything and trying to come up with a much more specific plan and data that is accurate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have those numbers in detail below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First let me say, I&amp;#39;m looking for any sort of feedback or advice (good or bad), but in particular any mistakes that we are still making or considerations that we haven&amp;#39;t considered yet. Our general philosophy is to approach this in a somewhat conservative manner, but still take some risks in that we can&amp;#39;t predict everything in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic background and assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Married couple 40 and 44. No kids. Washington DC based. Wife works for the federal government, I work in the private sector. We would both like to take 1 year off starting in 2025 or 2026 to travel the world. My wife would try to get a year of leave without pay (something that may be available to federal employees, note that she uses all of her vacation and sick leave already). I would quit my job. After 1 year, the expectation is that my wife wouldn&amp;#39;t go back to work (if she is still happy not working). I would probably not take a 9 to 5 job and would only consider part-time roles (I work in tech) that allow maximum travel flexibility (I&amp;#39;m not sure if this qualifies as barista fire or not). Essentially, I would scale up or down work depending on what we are doing and our finances. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are using the madfientist lab. Withdrawal rate 3.8%. Growth rate 6.0%. Future expenses $10,000/month (see below for an exact breakdown of this). &lt;strong&gt;Current FIRE date is in 4 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Net Worth&lt;/strong&gt;\nNet Worth is $1,960,000&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government Pension $300,000. We looked into this a lot and we are now assuming the pension is worth $300,000. I used this site. &lt;a href=\"https://valueyourpension.com/life-expectancy-present-value-calculator/\"&gt;https://valueyourpension.com/life-expectancy-present-value-calculator/&lt;/a&gt; I couldn&amp;#39;t find a good calculator that both does FIRE analysis and considers a future pension. When I input the data, it ranges from low $300,000s to low $500,000s. I went with $300,000 while assuming that inflation is 4% in the future, and yet the pension only increases at a 2% COLA once she starts to take the pension. Since I put in the $300,000 into including it as part of net worth for FIRE on &lt;a href=\"https://lab.madfientist.com/\"&gt;https://lab.madfientist.com/&lt;/a&gt;, the pension is going to grow at 6% which it actually isn&amp;#39;t. Hence, I&amp;#39;m trying to put inflation at 4% and cola at 2% to counter this and be more conservative. I didn&amp;#39;t see many writings for FIRE folks on how to account for future government pensions. \nPresent Value of Monthly Payment (assumes 3% inflation rate)$1,873&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Condo Rental $400,000. I talked to my wife about selling and just using the funds to invest in an equity ETF or even a REIT. At this time, that&amp;#39;s a non-starter as she wants to keep the condo. Our tenants of 8 years are about to move out. It looks like we will increase the monthly rate by $200, so the new positive cashflow on the property will be about $10,000 after all expenses including some maintenance. The property is worth around $400,000, so it isn&amp;#39;t a good yield, but she likes the idea of having a backup property near where we live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSA - Added in the $11,000 for the HSA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity ETF/Index Funds $1,246,000: \nTaxable $304,000, Roth IRA $287,000, 401K Roth $81,000, 401K Roth $250,000, 401K $83,000, 401K $241,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Current Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gross $294,258 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Employer   Paid Health $13,688&lt;br/&gt;\nEmployer Paid Insurance (, Dental, Life, Disability, Other) $1,822  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Employer Paid 401K/Pension and HSA $53,895\nEmployer Paid FICA $21,708&lt;br/&gt;\nTotal Compensation $385,371&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if people think of total compensation this way, but it was helpful for us to think about everything that we are getting from our jobs (including tax payments the employer does)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Current Taxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total Federal Tax   $49,938 12.96%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might change a bit since we have not started to fund 401K instead of Roth 401Ks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total State Tax $19,600 5.09%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might change a bit since we have not started to fund 401K instead of Roth 401Ks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total FICA (Employee Paid)  $21,708 5.63%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total Tax Costs Out of Pocket   $91,246 23.68%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Total Health Costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total Health Costs (includes all employer premiums, employee premiums, deductibles and copays)  $23,512 6.10%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Non-tax and non-health Costs (i.e. all expenses except for taxes and health)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DC Housing and Associated Bills Costs   $36,000 \nFood    $8,000&lt;br/&gt;\nShopping    $6,000&lt;br/&gt;\nEntertainment   $2,500&lt;br/&gt;\nAuto/Transport  $2,500&lt;br/&gt;\nDonations   $10,000 \nTravel  $3,000&lt;br/&gt;\nTotal Costs Excluding Taxes and Health  $68,000 17.65%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Retirement Contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total Retirement Contributions  $106,895    27.74%&lt;br/&gt;\n$78,385 once you exclude  the Pension&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total Potential Excess Cash After Retirement Contributions  $74,011 (annual)\nExpected Monthly Savings Towards FIRE Excluding Pension $12,700 (monthly retirement contributions and taxable contributions).\n$12,700 should be our target each month to buy an equity index ETF. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly FIRE Spend Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Health  $1,959&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other (Housing, Food, Shopping, Entertainment, Auto, Donations, Travel) $5,667&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buffer (unexpected expenses/lifestyle change/increased travel costs/taxes we can&amp;#39;t get out of)  $2,374&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total Monthly FIRE Spend    $10,000 (this is the number in the madfientist lab)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just took our current expenses above and added a buffer.

I&amp;#39;d be buying my new phone around Black Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Has anyone else seen/heard anything like this?\n\n1. My Wife was trying to use a 35K cert on a point advance booking. The reservation failed to confirm and we ended up on a screen that said points purchased failed. \n2. She also tried to book a straight reservation with the 35K cert and ended up on the same screen that a points purchase reservation failed. \n\nAfter this happened, we saw that she had fraud alerts from Amex, email, text and later a call. \n\n3. We called in the Marriott asking what is going on. The agent wasn't concerned about the Amex fraud warnings, but she did sort out getting the cert on the reservation after some time. I asked the agent that the Marriott team should create a case for the tech team as this is a big deal. \n\n4. Next day, the 35,000 points posted to my wife's account. I was floored and we called Marriott to ask what was going on. The agent said that there were 3 point purchase rejections and 1 went through. I guess Marriott let 1 go through. The agent said point purchases were non-refundable. After some back and forth where I explained that she didn't purchase the points and it is a rather large Marriott IT error, she agreed to upon some sort of special case. Note that the point purchase was never actually associated with a reservation and she never got any email about. it. \n\n5. Following day, the $437.50 Marriott post clears on the Amex Business Bonvoy card, we call Amex and ask what is going on. Amex says it is already under review. Then, the next following day, there is a credit back dated for $437.50 on her Amex account. \n\n6. As of today, the points are still in the account. All of this started March 5th. \n\nI'm just a bit floored as I've never seen or heard anything like this. Marriott isn't really known for great IT, but this seems to be a huge IT failure. Going forward, we are going to screen record all reservations. We are also going to lock any card for reservations and then unlock the card the next day. \n\nIs there anything else we should do? Any advice? Anyone ever heard of anything like this? Does Marriott monitor this channel. This seems like such a huge issue, I was thinking of reaching out to some Marriott tech people on Linkedin since I live in the DC area and work on the Salesforce platform which I know Marriott uses, but wasn't really sure if that was a huge breach in protocol or not.",

I don't really care about the perfect smile, but want to fix what I described above to not have an issue chewing.  I'm scheduled for 44 trays with 1 tray a week. Do you think\nthey could remove the attachments after 16 weeks and then use trays without attachments. I'm going to Australia for a month in 16 weeks and it would be awesome to remove the trays easier. \n\n3. I got the Ortho Key, the UV holder sanitizer, have extra toothbrushes/toothpaste. I've started water flossing at night as well. Other than those chewy things, anything else I should consider to avoid getting cavities or make this easier?\n\n4. Not sure how to compare, but with the trays in, I don't really have pain, but experience pain taking the trays out and then when I push against my teeth mainly without the trays in. \n\nAlso, not sure if this helps anyone, but I wonder if I had started using a retainer many years ago, my teeth wouldn't have moved over time.

However, now I'm reading with the safe harbor threshold that there is a 250 documented hour minimum. We have a property manager, but they don't document which days/hours they are working on our property for our tenants, etc. Very few PMs would provide that documentation, I'd think. \n\nI do consider that we have \"regularity and continuity coupled with the requirement to have a profit motive work well\" related to the rental property. \n\nWhat are others doing?

We didn&amp;#39;t claim safe harbor last year. I feel like when this was first announced in 2018, the consensus was that a couple that are W2 earners that own 1 rental property would qualify for the QBI deduction. However, now I&amp;#39;m reading with the safe harbor threshold that there is a 250 documented hour minimum. We have a property manager, but they don&amp;#39;t document which days/hours they are working on our property for our tenants, etc. Very few PMs would provide that documentation, I&amp;#39;d think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do consider that we have &amp;quot;regularity and continuity coupled with the requirement to have a profit motive work well&amp;quot; related to the rental property. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are others doing? Are people not taking 199A safe harbor and just claiming the standard 199A anyways for us small rental owners (1 or 2 properties), or are people giving up on this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that with depreciation, we don&amp;#39;t actually get any tax benefits right now, the QBI loss has just been accruing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Or, if we can't get a timeshare, then use points. \n\nCurrently:\n\n* 1st night on HIX Express on annual free certificate (in Kona)\n* 2nd through 7th night at a Wyndham timeshare on Wyndham points (15k/night) (west cost of island)\n* 8th-10th need a room\n* 11th -15th Hilton at Hilo at 40K/night with 5 night free\n\nI have Hilton Gold Status, IHG Platinum, Marriott Silver\nWe have SPG Points, Marriott Points, Amex, Chase, Hilton we could use. \n\nI'm struggling to find a good redemption for nights 8 through 10. SPG has two places, but then there are resort fees/parking fees which add on $50/night. Plus one of the SPG places has poor reviews. Hilton night on the west coast are at 60K/night plus resort fees. HIX is 40K, Courtyard 35K. I was looking at cash redemptions through Chase or Citi, but I'd hate to use 50K Chase points for 3 nights. \n",
