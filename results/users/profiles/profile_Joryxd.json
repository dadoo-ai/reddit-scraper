I need a car that is reliable, gets decent gas milage, automatic, low miles, and I wouldn't mind something that is fun to drive of course. I will be upgrading from my 2004 chevy cavalier base so it can't get much worse than my current. My current favorites on the list are the Jetta and the Malibu at face value. \n\nThe car I choose I will be driving from New York to Florida next month and will be used for my daily commuter about an hour round trip.

Could I possibly make a career out of this?  \nHow difficult is it landing that first job without any experience? I have a feeling employers won’t take me seriously even if I complete few certifications.\n\nSorry - i'm not directly in the UK, but still wanted to provide a bit of insight.   \n\n\nWhen breaking into any career path, especially ones that have a level of \"previous experience required\" it will always be a challenge to get your foot in the door. One of the things that I personally love about Salesforce is that there are several defined paths that can help you get there. Below are my suggestions:  \n\n\n1. Get yourself on social - Linkedin, Twitter, etc.. and start documenting your learning path. If you find a trailhead module particularly pleasant or fun to learn about, share it with your network. Follow other Salesforce professionals on the platforms you're on and listen to what they're talking about. \n2. Hit trailhead every... single..... day... for at least an hour. Feel free to take weekends off of course if you'd like. Don't cram... be consistent. \n3. Get Certified - there is nothing out there that will show people you're taking this seriously than investing in yourself by getting certified. Figure out what certifications are in demand, get experience in the basic ones and explore the others in the future.\n4. GET INVOLVED - join community groups, hop on webinars / seminars - tell your network about them. Did you learn anything from them? Great - share your takeaways with bullet points to others.\n5. GET real world business experience - Find a company that has Salesforce and find a way in. There's a mega shortage of talent - show you are a go-getter by taking a role you can do well and offer to help with the Salesforce org if you can. Having trouble getting real world experience? Go on the Trailblazer community and find a question that someone has, spin up a dev org, solve it and tell them about it. When I first was getting started I would go on these threads and just answer questions. Even if I didn't know them.. I would pull up my dev org and figure it out. Then I would give an answer and help them out. Feel free to say \"hey i'm new, but I did this in my dev org - and got it to work, is this what you're looking for?\"   \n\n\nI love Salesforce, it has amazing opportunities if you rise up and take them. Don't be afraid - get out there, and if the market is getting \"saturated\" be the best one out there looking.",

What do I need to have in order to start the tank?

Also to make sure that I have lots of plants and hiding places incase they breed so that the frys have a chance of surviving, and I would need to get special food just incase. Are there anythings that I am really missing to get started? What are you suggestions for getting the process going from bringing the tank home to getting the water set up to putting the fish in? I'm not very experienced and I would like to get started on the right foot!\n\nThanks for you help!\n\n\nEDIT- I just talked to an employee at my local fish store he suggested that I get some other fish before my mollies such as cherry barbs since mollies tend to thrive better in more mature water. He said once I get the cherry barbs in there for a couple of weeks I could add a few female mollies then I could add the male molly. ",

Also to make sure that I have lots of plants and hiding places incase they breed so that the frys have a chance of surviving, and I would need to get special food just incase. Are there anythings that I am really missing to get started? What are you suggestions for getting the process going from bringing the tank home to getting the water set up to putting the fish in? I&amp;#39;m not very experienced and I would like to get started on the right foot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for you help!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT- I just talked to an employee at my local fish store he suggested that I get some other fish before my mollies such as cherry barbs since mollies tend to thrive better in more mature water. He said once I get the cherry barbs in there for a couple of weeks I could add a few female mollies then I could add the male molly. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This test is not a direct determinant of your ability to do this work!\n\nHere are my suggestions:\n\nBased on your score it sounds like you did well overall across the board, with a few tweaks you’ll be passing this exam and others in no time.\n\n- Spruce up on mobile: grab a few trailheads related to mobile and set up some use cases. Put yourself in the seat of a sales person and figure out what could help you do more from your phone, then build it! Trailhead has tons of resources, but use your phone and sign in to the environment and play around. \n\nIt sounds like you split the goal posts with standard and custom objects and reporting. The good news is, one will lead to the other. Think about what reports are and how you can use them. Remember my previous suggestion about building a use case? Learn what objects you have, and find a use case you can solve with standard objects, custom objects, and reports and dashboards. Putting these pieces together will help boost those categories for you! Have you done the Spaceship app on Trailhead or the realty dream home trail? Both of these will help with standard and custom objects alike!\n\nOther than more trailhead and more hands on, keep going deeper with FoF, and take them very seriously.

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear that the exam didn’t go your way, chin up! It happens, and frankly I think you’ll be a better admin because of it. This test is not a direct determinant of your ability to do this work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on your score it sounds like you did well overall across the board, with a few tweaks you’ll be passing this exam and others in no time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Spruce up on mobile: grab a few trailheads related to mobile and set up some use cases. Put yourself in the seat of a sales person and figure out what could help you do more from your phone, then build it! Trailhead has tons of resources, but use your phone and sign in to the environment and play around. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you split the goal posts with standard and custom objects and reporting. The good news is, one will lead to the other. Think about what reports are and how you can use them. Remember my previous suggestion about building a use case? Learn what objects you have, and find a use case you can solve with standard objects, custom objects, and reports and dashboards. Putting these pieces together will help boost those categories for you! Have you done the Spaceship app on Trailhead or the realty dream home trail? Both of these will help with standard and custom objects alike!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than more trailhead and more hands on, keep going deeper with FoF, and take them very seriously. Look at the sections you didn’t do well on and go right to those detailed sections on FoF. Don’t just guess and take the answer as right and move on, learn the “why”, and ask yourself this question a lot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
