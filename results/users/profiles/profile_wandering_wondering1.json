There are some prebuilt connectors and then there is an Ingestion API if you need to connect to other sources. The \"harmonizing\" comes from mapping the source data to the data cloud objects and then using match and reconciliation rulesets to determine which are really the same individual. You can get as exact or as fuzzy as you want on those and also set source priority. They might have a profile on the ecomm site as Bill Smith at 123 Main Street but in the CRM they are William Smith at 123 Main Street so you can have it match on last name and address.  Once you have that keyring with the harmonized data you can display it in the CRM - so for customer service they could see all activities, orders, email engagement, cases, etc.  Then you can do Calculated Insights based on the harmonized data like who are the top customers based on this, that and this and then do Activations for marketing purposes. You can segment campaigns by like last ordered in the past 6 months and clicked on this email - you can get pretty granular. It can also be the foundation for leveraging AI against all of the harmonized data.\n\nIngesting the data, running the rulesets, calculated insights and activations all cost credits and you have to look at number of rows and frequency to calculate that.\n\nIf you simply need like an External object to display Order data related to a person and you have a primary key to match it up then you don't need Data Cloud. The power is in the reconciliation, being able to add in the engagement data for the true 360 view and running the Calculated Insights.\n\nHope that helps!",

In the center are stand up booths with Salesforce and some key vendors. Salesforce employees can give you a quick 5-10 demo/chat around specific areas. Same with some key vendors.  Around the perimeter are theater sessions - 20 min and 40 min. Stage and open seating with overflow of people standing in the back. First come/first serve. Sometimes hard to hear in the melee of the open area. Sometimes they have dedicated headphones they hand out.  One thing I noticed last year is the session sign has a QR code for an app where you can get closed captioning - really helped me understand what speakers were saying because its loud in there. Also in this area are activities/activations - like Salesforce Design - do this design activity to understand better UX, etc.  And then also a roped off area with computers to do challenges for the quest - usually Trailhead modules. Note you don't have to do challenges on site - you can grab the challenge cards, do them on your laptop and bring it back to show them. Usually this is for bigger swag items. Also usually a photo opportunity in the area. Have your badge scanned wherever you go here if you're interested in the quest/swag.\n\n2nd Floor - open areas with product specific focuses - think Slack, Tableau, Mulesoft, Flow - they usually have some activities and also some open theater like sessions in those open areas. Also, specific rooms down the halls for theater sessions. First come/first serve for most and people line up ahead of time - can reach capacity.\n\n3rd Floor - keynote room and also I think they usually have focus areas in the open areas - usually the Community Campfire which also has some smaller open sessions - sit on stools or stand around. These are usually career or community focused. (Note don't quote me on floor placement - they move these things around). \n\nMoscone South - go through security on Howard street which is closed off and you get to Moscone South - go down the escalator and this is the huge vendor booth area. There are also some various Salesforce activities/demos. You can go underground from there or at street level on the other side of Howard for the Main Keynote room - this is where the big Tues Keynote is and sometimes Marc and a \"luminary speaker\".\n\nHoward Street is closed off and you can sometimes find places to sit there, some various booths on each side. They often have live entertainment / bands over there so its a good place to chill.   \n  \nThese are your main areas. I know there are some hands on type sessions over in the Marriott (really close to Moscone) and maybe a couple other close areas. Certification testing is usually in the basement floor of the Marriott.\n\nWhile these things are all within a block of each other - it is packed on the sidewalk, crossing the street and getting through security when going from West to South. You'll likely spend most time in West for sessions and the campground.\n\nBox lunches are available in West, South and usually outside in the Yerba Buena park area (behind the Metreon).\n\nBe sure to download the Salesforce Events app on mobile - its usually updated with Dreamforce details a week ahead. It has a map, directions, your agenda, all sessions listed, etc. It will also have the Quest on it so you can see activities you need to win swag. Swag is usually some plushies, a tshirt, etc. - very much reduced from years past. There is a swag redemption area usually near the Trailblazer Forest - sometimes the line seems long but it goes fast.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now but happy to answer any specific questions.",

You can go underground from there or at street level on the other side of Howard for the Main Keynote room - this is where the big Tues Keynote is and sometimes Marc and a &amp;quot;luminary speaker&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howard Street is closed off and you can sometimes find places to sit there, some various booths on each side. They often have live entertainment / bands over there so its a good place to chill.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are your main areas. I know there are some hands on type sessions over in the Marriott (really close to Moscone) and maybe a couple other close areas. Certification testing is usually in the basement floor of the Marriott.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While these things are all within a block of each other - it is packed on the sidewalk, crossing the street and getting through security when going from West to South. You&amp;#39;ll likely spend most time in West for sessions and the campground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Box lunches are available in West, South and usually outside in the Yerba Buena park area (behind the Metreon).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be sure to download the Salesforce Events app on mobile - its usually updated with Dreamforce details a week ahead. It has a map, directions, your agenda, all sessions listed, etc. It will also have the Quest on it so you can see activities you need to win swag. Swag is usually some plushies, a tshirt, etc. - very much reduced from years past. There is a swag redemption area usually near the Trailblazer Forest - sometimes the line seems long but it goes fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I can think of for now but happy to answer any specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
