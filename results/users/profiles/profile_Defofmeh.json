    "body": "The mall felt easy that afternoon. The way sunlight spilled from the high glass ceilings, glinting off storefront windows, made the whole place feel almost lazy. We weren’t shopping for anything in particular. Just wandering. Killing time. Or maybe daring time to catch up to us.\n\nThat was when I saw it, a flash of soft yellow hanging on a clearance rack. Barely-there fabric. Summer sunlight sewn into a dress with thin straps and a hem that would dance around my knees. It looked like something meant for a girl who knew how to take up space without apology. I wasn't sure what made me reach for it. Maybe the way Evan's hand brushed lightly against the small of my back, or maybe the way the sunlight caught the folds of fabric and made them glow. Whatever it was, my fingers closed around the hanger before I could second-guess myself. \"Should I try it on?\" I asked, the question small, tentative. I kept my gaze fixed on the dress, too shy to meet his eyes. Evan's answer came without hesitation. \n\n\"I'd love to see it on you.\"\n\nI hesitated, tossing a glance over my shoulder. His smile was soft. Steady. Like he knew all the fears fluttering just under my skin, and loved me all the more for them. \n\n\n\nHeart thudding, I slipped the sundress off the rack and walked to the fitting rooms tucked in the back. The curtains there were a joke. Thin. Flimsy. Hanging from a rod with no lock or latch. And they didn't even reach the floor, anyone walking by could see my shoes, the hem of the curtain swaying with every step.\n\nThe clerk behind the counter, a college girl whose name tag read \"Claire\", barely glanced up, lost in whatever was playing on her phone.\n\n\n\nI ducked into a stall and pulled the curtain almost closed behind me. Almost. No matter how hard I tried, it gapped slightly at the edges.\n\n\n\nI stepped into the tiny space, the sundress clutched to my chest. I peeled off my jeans and sweater with clumsy fingers, folding them neatly onto the little bench next to my bag, the air cool against my skin. For a second, I hesitated, then, with a quick glance at the almost-shut curtain, removed my bra, but kept my panties on.\n\nI slid the yellow dress over my head. It whispered against my bare skin as it settled, scandalously thin and weightless. It clung just enough to hint at the shape of me, and the thin straps left my shoulders bare, vulnerable.\n\nWhen I turned to face the mirror, I almost didn't recognize myself. I looked...different. Softer. Braver. I looked...dangerous. A secret tucked inside sunshine.\n\nThrough the thin fabric of the curtain, I could sense Evan waiting. Steady. My fingers trembled as they found the edge of the curtain. I hesitated. Then, before I could lose the courage the dress had given me, I peeled it back an inch. His eyes lifted from his hands to meet mine, and for a long moment, neither of us breathed. The way he looked at me. He said nothing. He didn't move closer. I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, the hem of the sundress swaying around my knees like a secret. \n\n\"Can I see more?\" he asked, voice low, careful. \n\n“Wow, you look amazing,” he said simply. \n\nI swallowed hard, then slipped out from behind the curtain entirely, the thin cotton of the dress floating around me. I stood there in the narrow aisle, heart hammering, every instinct screaming to cover myself, to hide, but Evan just looked. Slowly. Thoroughly. As if memorizing. Heat rose to my cheeks, my throat. I bit my lower lip, half wanting to duck back into the safety of the dressing room, half wanting to stay and soak up the way he saw me like I was something rare. Evan stepped closer, slow, careful, giving me time to stop him if I needed to. I didn't. I wouldn't. His hand lifted, hesitated, then brushed a knuckle down my bare arm, so lightly I barely felt it. I shivered. Taking my hand, he lifted our joined hands between us, his thumb brushing again over my knuckles.I squeezed his hand, small and sure, and took a tiny step backward into the booth. The curtain brushed my bare shoulder, the sundress strap trembling against my skin. \n\n\n\nHis body slipped in behind me, so close I could feel the brush of air from him parting the space between us. The curtain swayed once, twice, before settling back into place, a thin, fragile shield against the world outside. The dressing room was tiny, almost laughably so, but with Evan filling it, it felt like the walls had disappeared. I caught the faintest glance behind him, the bored clerk, the distracted woman browsing a rack of scarves, and my breath caught at the sheer risk of us both being in here together. \n\n\n\n“Need any help with your dress?” he asked, low enough that it seemed to vibrate straight through my skin. \n\nMy mouth parted but no sound came out at first. I could feel my cheeks burning, but it wasn’t shame. It was something sharper, sweeter. Need, curling low in my belly. I looked at him through the mirror, at the way his eyes darkened, drinking me in, holding me\n\n“Y-yeah,” I whispered, my voice barely audible even in the hush between us. \n\n“Can you see the tag?” I lifted my hair off my neck, baring the vulnerable curve of it. \n\n“In the back.”   \n  \nThe fabric clung to me, the sundress light and teasing against my hips, the thin cotton doing almost nothing to hide the quickening pulse under my skin. I stood there, offering myself, trusting him to take just as much as I could give.   \n  \nHis fingers gliding over my shoulders, displacing the straps to slide down my arms. I shivered under the gentleness of it, the way he moved like he was unwrapping something too delicate to rush. My fingers tightened slightly in the fabric bunched at my hips, anchoring myself. Then, his breath against my ear.  \n  \nMy knees nearly buckled when I felt his body shift behind me, a slow, almost casual adjustment, and then the thick, unmistakable pressure of him brushing against the curve of my ass through his jeans.   \n  \nI gasped, instinctively pressing forward an inch, my hands flattening against the mirror for balance. I caught his eyes in the reflection. Dark. Hungry. Reverent. Like he was memorizing the sight of me half-undressed, trembling, offering myself without needing a single command.  \n  \nThe sundress slipped, first in whispers, then faster, pooling in a bright yellow puddle at my feet. I could hear the faint murmur of the mall outside, distant footsteps, the hum of fluorescent lights, but in here, the air was thick with something heavier. \n\nI stood there in just the simple lace panties I’d worn under my jeans, my arms frozen halfway between hiding and surrender. Cool air kissed the now-bared skin of my back, my thighs. My cheeks burned, but my chest swelled with something bigger than fear.\n\nI didn’t move to grab the dress. I didn’t cover myself. I stood there, breathing shallowly, waiting, needing, to feel what Evan would do next. I wanted him to tell me. I wanted him to show me.\n\nHis slid his hands up my thighs, ghosting higher until his fingers found the lace barrier of my panties. His thumb pressed lightly against me through the damp fabric. Testing. Smirking when he found how ready I was.\n\nHis breath brushed my ear again, low and molten, threading straight down my spine. \"Now grab the sides of your panties and slide them down your legs.\" The words were simple. Quiet.\n\nI swallowed hard, my fingers trembling as they found the thin straps at my hips. I bent slowly, dragging the lace down my thighs, over my knees, down my calves. The motion made the blood rush hot and dizzy in my ears. I let the panties pool at my ankles, stepping out of them with a soft, breathless shudder.\n\nBehind me, Evan's breath thickened. The mirror caught everything, the fall of the fabric, the way my body shook, the way my skin flushed deeper. I straightened, still facing the mirror, my cheeks burning, my chest heaving. \n\nFootsteps scraped nearby. The shuffle of shoes. Someone stopping just outside the thin curtain. Panic clutched at my throat. Evan's hand clamped lightly on my hip steady, reassuring. \n\nI whimpered softly. His touch shifted, a slow, reverent caress over the curve of my bare ass, I fought moaning aloud. His hand drifted lower, between my thighs, finding the aching, desperate heat there. I gasped, a sharp, involuntary sound, and his other hand slid up to cup the side of my throat, not squeezing, just holding, steadying me.\n\nHis fingers found me, slow at first, teasing, gathering the wetness he had drawn from me so easily. He stroked along my folds with devastating precision, his touch light but deliberate, coaxing the need out of me in shuddering waves. I pressed my forehead to the mirror, biting my lip hard enough to sting. The first real moan broke free, soft, desperate.   \n  \nIn an instant, his mouth was back at my ear, his voice a dark, velvet command. \"Quiet, sweetheart. You don’t want them to hear, do you?\" I shook my head, frantic, clenching the sides of the mirror.   \n  \nHis fingers slid deeper, just barely breaching me, then retreated to circle my clit with maddening slowness. My legs shook. My whole body fought to stay upright. Every time my hips bucked into his hand without meaning to, he slowed, teased, barely kept me on the edge, never letting me fall. The pleasure built so thick and sharp it made tears prick at the corners of my eyes. I wanted to scream. I wanted to beg. I wanted him to never, ever stop.\n\nThe room blurred, the golden light, the faint sounds of the mall beyond, even the mirror in front of me, all of it washed away under the tidal pull of him, of this. \n\nI couldn't stop the sounds slipping out anymore. Small, broken whimpers kept rising in my throat, no matter how hard I bit my lip, no matter how fiercely I pressed my forehead to the mirror. Every slow, devastating circle of Evan's fingers sent another sharp wave crashing through me. My hips rolled without permission, desperate for more friction, more pressure, more him. And I knew I was losing the battle to stay silent. \n\nI heard it, the faint shift of footsteps beyond the curtain. The low hum of a voice, the clerk, maybe. Alive again. Awake. My heart stuttered, terror and pleasure tangling inside me, making me burn hotter, tremble harder.\n\nI whimpered at the loss, until I felt him crouch behind me. The brush of fabric against my lips. My panties. Still damp. Still warm from my own skin. I hesitated, shocked, thrilled, helpless. \n\nThen I opened my mouth. Let him push the soaked cotton between my lips. Let him own me in this small, shattering way. The humiliation, the heat, was instant.The moment the panties filled my mouth, muffling my cries, I moaned low in my throat, a desperate, broken sound that no one outside could hear.\n\nThe footsteps outside shifted. A laugh. They moved on.\n\nEvan rose behind me, his body a wall of heat, his hand sliding right back between my thighs without mercy. \n\nHe circled and stroked with devastating patience, keeping me balanced on the razor's edge of release, my legs trembling so badly I had to brace both palms flat against the mirror to keep from collapsing. I saw myself in the glass. Saw the wreckage he made of me, flushed, glassy-eyed, panting around the panties he had fed me. And I loved it. I loved the way he made me feel.\n\nI sobbed into the soaked cotton when he found just the right rhythm, slow, relentless, devastating. The knot inside me twisted tighter and tighter, unbearable, beautiful. I knew he wasn’t ready to let me fall yet. And God, neither was I. I wanted to stay here forever, helpless in his hands, teetering on the brink, knowing he owned every gasp, every shiver, every helpless, aching whimper I couldn't hold back. Evan’s hand never faltered.\n\nSlow, devastating circles, each one pushing me closer, closer, until I was standing on the very edge of something wild and bottomless. My thighs shook violently. My breath came in frantic little sobs around the wet cotton stuffed between my lips. Tears burned at the corners of my eyes, blurring the mirror in front of me. I felt it, the pressure coiling low in my belly, tighter and tighter, ready to snap. \n\nSuddenly, a voice spoke from beyond the curtain. “Yeah, head to the back pick an empty changing room” the clerk called, too bright, too close. I froze, every muscle locking tight, terror and need crashing together in my veins. \n\nEvan’s hand never stopped. He only pressed closer against my back, his mouth grazing the shell of my ear, his voice low and dark and commanding. \n\n\"Cum for me.. Right now. Stay silent. Stay mine.\" \n\nThe words shattered something inside me. The last of my resistance crumbled. I broke, silently, utterly, my body convulsing against his hand in helpless, wracking waves. \n\nThe orgasm ripped through me like fire, like drowning, my knees buckling as white heat exploded behind my eyes. I screamed into the panties in my mouth, muffled, desperate, the only sound a low, broken whimper that no one outside would ever hear. I clung to the mirror, trembling violently, every nerve lit and trembling, like I’d been set alight from the inside. Somehow, impossibly, I heard myself whimper, a tiny, pitiful sound, and Evan’s hand slid from between my thighs to steady me, wrapping strong arms around my waist, anchoring me as I sagged against him.  \n\nFrom beyond the curtain, the clerk’s voice came again, distracted now: \n\n“Cute dress. You should get it.” \n\nI would have laughed if I could breathe. Instead, I melted into Evan’s body, my legs useless, my heart hammering like a wild thing. He held me through it, firm, steady, his thumb stroking lazy circles over my bare hip, grounding me as the aftershocks tore through my trembling frame. And in that moment, bare, undone, silenced by my own soaked lace and shielded by his arms, I had never, ever felt more safe. More wanted. More his.\n\nHis mouth found the back of my neck, a slow, lingering kiss that made my knees threaten to buckle all over again. I shuddered under the soft, burning press of his lips, every inch of me quaking from the release he had torn from me with nothing but patience and power. Then his hand slid around, fingers slick with my own need, and he pulled the panties gently from my mouth. I whimpered softly as they left me, the air cool against my wet, swollen lips. He didn’t toss them away. No, I watched through dazed, heavy-lidded eyes as he tucked them into his pocket like something precious.\n\nEvan turned me gently, maneuvering me backward until the backs of my thighs bumped the little bench. I sank onto it, dazed and flushed, the dress still at my feet. I could still hear the faint hum of the store beyond, the clerk moving, the distant clatter of a hanger sliding on a rack. We weren't hidden. Not really. And that made the space between us feel electric.\n\nAs he stood before me, while I sat on the bench, I reached out, fingers brushing along the denim stretched over him, a featherlight touch, a prayer made flesh. He was so hard. I swallowed, my throat dry, my cheeks burning, but I didn’t pull back. \n\nI wanted to touch him. I wanted to worship him the way he had worshipped. I looked up again, meeting his eyes, wide, pleading, asking without words: Is this what you want? Am I allowed? His nod was small. Barely a tilt of his head. But it cracked the last sliver of restraint inside me. I let my fingers trail higher, up over the zipper, the thick ridge beneath the denim, until I could barely breathe for how badly I needed to touch him.Shaking with aftershocks, I tugged at the button of his jeans, clumsy, fumbling, but he didn’t help. He stood there, watching, letting me work for it. \n\nI finally got him undone, dragging the zipper down, the sound loud in the small, charged space. When he freed his cock, my breath caught.Thick. Heavy. Already glistening at the tip.\n\nHis gaze locked with mine, and he gave a slow, commanding nod, a silent instruction. Suck.\n\nI leaned forward instinctively, lips parting, desperate to taste, to worship, to show him how much I needed him. \n\nI could only serve him with my mouth, obedient, trembling, eager.But just as I got close, just as my breath ghosted over the slick head of him, his hand caught my hair. Firm. Unyielding. Stopping me. I froze, blinking up at him, the ache between my legs sparking fresh and desperate. He didn't speak.\n\nHe shifted his hand, stroking my hair in silent praise, good girl, and then, slowly, deliberately, he fisted the base of his cock. I gasped, couldn't help it, watching as he stroked his thick shaft right in front of me, slow and steady, his thumb swiping through the wetness already gathering at the tip. It was the most obscene, beautiful thing I had ever seen. I sat there, bare, flushed, body still lit from within from the orgasm he had wrung out of me minutes before, and let him do it. Let him use me as his audience. The world outside blurred into white noise. \n\nBut somewhere, faint, I caught the low hum of voices: The clerk answering a phone call. Her distracted laugh. Footsteps passing the entrance of the boutique, another shopper maybe, but not stopping. Not looking. We were invisible, and exposed. \n\nI moaned softly, unable to help myself, pressing my thighs together as Evan’s hand worked over himself with slow, ruthless precision.\n\nThen he gripped the base of his cock with one hand feeding, it to me slowly. I opened without hesitation, lips parting, tongue flicking out shyly to taste the soft, heavy weight of him. He fed himself into my mouth, barely enough to stretch my lips around him, to let me savor the impossible heat and velvet texture of his skin. I sucked gently, reverently, moaning low in my throat as I cradled him with my mouth.\n\nThe risk. The wrongness. The flimsy curtain shielding us from the public made every moment sharper, hotter. Footsteps again. Loud this time. Close.\n\nEvan’s hand flexed at the back of my head, urging me to stay steady. Stay good. Another shadow passed the curtain. A laugh. The squeak of sneakers. I flushed crimson but obeyed, keeping my mouth locked around him. He shuddered, a low, broken sound escaping him, but he didn't let me take more. He pulled back before I could grow greedy, before I could fall fully into worship.\n\nI whimpered, aching for him, but stayed still, obedient, desperate, his. He resumed stroking himself, faster now, the muscles of his thighs flexing, his chest rising and falling in ragged heaves. I watched, wide-eyed and hungry, knowing what was coming, knowing it was for me. \n\nHis breathing sharpened, ragged, uneven, and I knew. He stood before me, one hand braced on the wall for balance. I tilted my chin up, offering myself without shame, my heart hammering against my ribs. Thick, hot jets painted my cheeks, my lips, the curve of my jaw.\n\nI moaned low in my throat, the sound vibrating around the thick weight of emotion swelling in my chest. I didn't flinch. I didn’t wipe it away.I sat back slightly on the bench, my thighs pressed tightly together, my hands folded obediently in my lap. The mess cooled quickly on my flushed skin, making me hyper-aware of every inch where he had painted me. \n\nHe exhaled sharply, still trembling as he zipped himself away with quiet, practiced control, his body still trembling from the force of his orgasm. His hand found my chin, a slow, reverent touch, tilting my face up until I had no choice but to meet his eyes. They were so dark. So full. So certain. \n\n\"You’re going to put the dress back on,\" he murmured, voice rough but gentle. \"And you're going to fold up your other clothes, nice and neat, and put them in your bag.\"\n\nI blinked up at him, stunned, trembling, but my heart surged with something wild and reckless at the edges of his voice.\n\n\"And you're going to wear the new dress out of here,\" he continued, thumb brushing once, so lightly, over the mess cooling on my cheek. \n\n\"No panties. No bra. Just this...\" He lifted the dress off the floor with a finger and presented it to meA small, wicked smile touched the corners of his mouth. \"...and me.\" \n\nI slipped the yellow dress back into place, smoothing it down over my bare trembling body. The fabric was so thin, it clung everywhere, outlining not just the shape of my breasts but the pointed peaks of my nipples. Through the soft yellow, I could even see the dusky flush of them, darker than the golden warmth of my olive skin. Every brush of cotton against my sensitive, freshly wrecked body made me shudder.\n\nNo cleanup. No wiping me off. My breath caught painfully in my chest. The idea of walking out, bare beneath the dress, still marked by him, was almost too much. Walking out of here, flushed, bare under the flimsy sundress, dripping with the proof of him still marking my face, with the clerk none the wiser.\n\nWhen I stood, the hem swirled around my bare legs, the lightest of touches. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, cheeks flushed, lips kiss-swollen, a faint smear of his release glistening along my jaw. I folded my jeans, sweater and bra with careful, trembling hands, stuffing them into my tote bag, feeling the slickness between my thighs every time I shifted. \n\nHe took my hand as we slipped from the fitting room. Then, bold, unhurried, his hand slid low, fondling the curve of my bare ass through the thin cotton of the sundress. I gasped, biting my lip hard to muffle the sound. Then, lower. His fingers brushed over the cleft of my cheeks, a teasing, fleeting caress across the most vulnerable part of me. I shuddered, a sharp, helpless jolt, my whole body clenching around the ghost of his touch. \n\n\"Time to go,” he murmured against my ear, voice rich with dark amusement. \n\n“I think we’re being watched.” My heart stuttered painfully. I risked a quick, terrified glance through the gap in the curtain. There, near the racks of scarves, a woman in her thirties, pretending to browse but sneaking glances our way. She wasn’t frowning. She was smiling. Almost conspiratorial. \n\nHeat flooded me, mortification and reckless pride tangling so tightly I couldn't tell where one ended and the other began. My pulse stuttered. But the way she smiled, like she understood, made me stand straighter instead of hiding.\n\nEvan’s hand slid down to the small of my back, guiding me forward with a light pressure that brooked no argument.\n\n“Go talk to the clerk,” he said, low and firm. \n\n“Tell her you’re buying the dress.” \n\n“Tell her you’re wearing it out.”I would have to walk across the floor, bare beneath the fluttering sundress, thighs still damp, cheeks still carrying the faint, telltale mark of his claim. Everyone would see. \n\nClaire glanced up as we approached.\n\nHer gaze swept over Evan first, the lazy power in his stride, then to me. When I reached the counter, the clerk beamed. Claire’s gaze snagged briefly at the faint, visible peaks pressing against the dress’s soft fabric, a small, lingering glance, but she said nothing. Only the slow, knowing curve of her mouth betrayed what she saw.\n\n“Find everything you need?” she chirped. I swallowed, hard, and nodded, forcing my voice to steady even as my hands shook. \n\n“I’d... I’d like to buy this one,” I said, voice barely above a whisper. The clerk tilted her head. \n\n“Want me to ring you up and cut the tags off so you can wear it out?”\n\nEvan slid the tag from the dress’s neckline and handed it to her without a word.\n\nClaire’s fingers brushed his when she took it. A little too long. A little too curious.\n\n“All set, hon,” she said, oblivious to the wild, frantic thunder of my heart. I thanked her, or tried to, but the words tangled in my throat.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mall felt easy that afternoon. The way sunlight spilled from the high glass ceilings, glinting off storefront windows, made the whole place feel almost lazy. We weren’t shopping for anything in particular. Just wandering. Killing time. Or maybe daring time to catch up to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was when I saw it, a flash of soft yellow hanging on a clearance rack. Barely-there fabric. Summer sunlight sewn into a dress with thin straps and a hem that would dance around my knees. It looked like something meant for a girl who knew how to take up space without apology. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what made me reach for it. Maybe the way Evan&amp;#39;s hand brushed lightly against the small of my back, or maybe the way the sunlight caught the folds of fabric and made them glow. Whatever it was, my fingers closed around the hanger before I could second-guess myself. &amp;quot;Should I try it on?&amp;quot; I asked, the question small, tentative. I kept my gaze fixed on the dress, too shy to meet his eyes. Evan&amp;#39;s answer came without hesitation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d love to see it on you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated, tossing a glance over my shoulder. His smile was soft. Steady. Like he knew all the fears fluttering just under my skin, and loved me all the more for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heart thudding, I slipped the sundress off the rack and walked to the fitting rooms tucked in the back. The curtains there were a joke. Thin. Flimsy. Hanging from a rod with no lock or latch. And they didn&amp;#39;t even reach the floor, anyone walking by could see my shoes, the hem of the curtain swaying with every step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The clerk behind the counter, a college girl whose name tag read &amp;quot;Claire&amp;quot;, barely glanced up, lost in whatever was playing on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ducked into a stall and pulled the curtain almost closed behind me. Almost. No matter how hard I tried, it gapped slightly at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped into the tiny space, the sundress clutched to my chest. I peeled off my jeans and sweater with clumsy fingers, folding them neatly onto the little bench next to my bag, the air cool against my skin. For a second, I hesitated, then, with a quick glance at the almost-shut curtain, removed my bra, but kept my panties on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slid the yellow dress over my head. It whispered against my bare skin as it settled, scandalously thin and weightless. It clung just enough to hint at the shape of me, and the thin straps left my shoulders bare, vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I turned to face the mirror, I almost didn&amp;#39;t recognize myself. I looked...different. Softer. Braver. I looked...dangerous. A secret tucked inside sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through the thin fabric of the curtain, I could sense Evan waiting. Steady. My fingers trembled as they found the edge of the curtain. I hesitated. Then, before I could lose the courage the dress had given me, I peeled it back an inch. His eyes lifted from his hands to meet mine, and for a long moment, neither of us breathed. The way he looked at me. He said nothing. He didn&amp;#39;t move closer. I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, the hem of the sundress swaying around my knees like a secret. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can I see more?&amp;quot; he asked, voice low, careful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Wow, you look amazing,” he said simply. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swallowed hard, then slipped out from behind the curtain entirely, the thin cotton of the dress floating around me. I stood there in the narrow aisle, heart hammering, every instinct screaming to cover myself, to hide, but Evan just looked. Slowly. Thoroughly. As if memorizing. Heat rose to my cheeks, my throat. I bit my lower lip, half wanting to duck back into the safety of the dressing room, half wanting to stay and soak up the way he saw me like I was something rare. Evan stepped closer, slow, careful, giving me time to stop him if I needed to. I didn&amp;#39;t. I wouldn&amp;#39;t. His hand lifted, hesitated, then brushed a knuckle down my bare arm, so lightly I barely felt it. I shivered. Taking my hand, he lifted our joined hands between us, his thumb brushing again over my knuckles.I squeezed his hand, small and sure, and took a tiny step backward into the booth. The curtain brushed my bare shoulder, the sundress strap trembling against my skin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His body slipped in behind me, so close I could feel the brush of air from him parting the space between us. The curtain swayed once, twice, before settling back into place, a thin, fragile shield against the world outside. The dressing room was tiny, almost laughably so, but with Evan filling it, it felt like the walls had disappeared. I caught the faintest glance behind him, the bored clerk, the distracted woman browsing a rack of scarves, and my breath caught at the sheer risk of us both being in here together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Need any help with your dress?” he asked, low enough that it seemed to vibrate straight through my skin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mouth parted but no sound came out at first. I could feel my cheeks burning, but it wasn’t shame. It was something sharper, sweeter. Need, curling low in my belly. I looked at him through the mirror, at the way his eyes darkened, drinking me in, holding me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Y-yeah,” I whispered, my voice barely audible even in the hush between us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Can you see the tag?” I lifted my hair off my neck, baring the vulnerable curve of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“In the back.”   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fabric clung to me, the sundress light and teasing against my hips, the thin cotton doing almost nothing to hide the quickening pulse under my skin. I stood there, offering myself, trusting him to take just as much as I could give.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His fingers gliding over my shoulders, displacing the straps to slide down my arms. I shivered under the gentleness of it, the way he moved like he was unwrapping something too delicate to rush. My fingers tightened slightly in the fabric bunched at my hips, anchoring myself. Then, his breath against my ear.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My knees nearly buckled when I felt his body shift behind me, a slow, almost casual adjustment, and then the thick, unmistakable pressure of him brushing against the curve of my ass through his jeans.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gasped, instinctively pressing forward an inch, my hands flattening against the mirror for balance. I caught his eyes in the reflection. Dark. Hungry. Reverent. Like he was memorizing the sight of me half-undressed, trembling, offering myself without needing a single command.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sundress slipped, first in whispers, then faster, pooling in a bright yellow puddle at my feet. I could hear the faint murmur of the mall outside, distant footsteps, the hum of fluorescent lights, but in here, the air was thick with something heavier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there in just the simple lace panties I’d worn under my jeans, my arms frozen halfway between hiding and surrender. Cool air kissed the now-bared skin of my back, my thighs. My cheeks burned, but my chest swelled with something bigger than fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t move to grab the dress. I didn’t cover myself. I stood there, breathing shallowly, waiting, needing, to feel what Evan would do next. I wanted him to tell me. I wanted him to show me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His slid his hands up my thighs, ghosting higher until his fingers found the lace barrier of my panties. His thumb pressed lightly against me through the damp fabric. Testing. Smirking when he found how ready I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His breath brushed my ear again, low and molten, threading straight down my spine. &amp;quot;Now grab the sides of your panties and slide them down your legs.&amp;quot; The words were simple. Quiet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swallowed hard, my fingers trembling as they found the thin straps at my hips. I bent slowly, dragging the lace down my thighs, over my knees, down my calves. The motion made the blood rush hot and dizzy in my ears. I let the panties pool at my ankles, stepping out of them with a soft, breathless shudder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Behind me, Evan&amp;#39;s breath thickened. The mirror caught everything, the fall of the fabric, the way my body shook, the way my skin flushed deeper. I straightened, still facing the mirror, my cheeks burning, my chest heaving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Footsteps scraped nearby. The shuffle of shoes. Someone stopping just outside the thin curtain. Panic clutched at my throat. Evan&amp;#39;s hand clamped lightly on my hip steady, reassuring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I whimpered softly. His touch shifted, a slow, reverent caress over the curve of my bare ass, I fought moaning aloud. His hand drifted lower, between my thighs, finding the aching, desperate heat there. I gasped, a sharp, involuntary sound, and his other hand slid up to cup the side of my throat, not squeezing, just holding, steadying me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His fingers found me, slow at first, teasing, gathering the wetness he had drawn from me so easily. He stroked along my folds with devastating precision, his touch light but deliberate, coaxing the need out of me in shuddering waves. I pressed my forehead to the mirror, biting my lip hard enough to sting. The first real moan broke free, soft, desperate.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an instant, his mouth was back at my ear, his voice a dark, velvet command. &amp;quot;Quiet, sweetheart. You don’t want them to hear, do you?&amp;quot; I shook my head, frantic, clenching the sides of the mirror.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His fingers slid deeper, just barely breaching me, then retreated to circle my clit with maddening slowness. My legs shook. My whole body fought to stay upright. Every time my hips bucked into his hand without meaning to, he slowed, teased, barely kept me on the edge, never letting me fall. The pleasure built so thick and sharp it made tears prick at the corners of my eyes. I wanted to scream. I wanted to beg. I wanted him to never, ever stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room blurred, the golden light, the faint sounds of the mall beyond, even the mirror in front of me, all of it washed away under the tidal pull of him, of this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t stop the sounds slipping out anymore. Small, broken whimpers kept rising in my throat, no matter how hard I bit my lip, no matter how fiercely I pressed my forehead to the mirror. Every slow, devastating circle of Evan&amp;#39;s fingers sent another sharp wave crashing through me. My hips rolled without permission, desperate for more friction, more pressure, more him. And I knew I was losing the battle to stay silent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard it, the faint shift of footsteps beyond the curtain. The low hum of a voice, the clerk, maybe. Alive again. Awake. My heart stuttered, terror and pleasure tangling inside me, making me burn hotter, tremble harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I whimpered at the loss, until I felt him crouch behind me. The brush of fabric against my lips. My panties. Still damp. Still warm from my own skin. I hesitated, shocked, thrilled, helpless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I opened my mouth. Let him push the soaked cotton between my lips. Let him own me in this small, shattering way. The humiliation, the heat, was instant.The moment the panties filled my mouth, muffling my cries, I moaned low in my throat, a desperate, broken sound that no one outside could hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The footsteps outside shifted. A laugh. They moved on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evan rose behind me, his body a wall of heat, his hand sliding right back between my thighs without mercy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He circled and stroked with devastating patience, keeping me balanced on the razor&amp;#39;s edge of release, my legs trembling so badly I had to brace both palms flat against the mirror to keep from collapsing. I saw myself in the glass. Saw the wreckage he made of me, flushed, glassy-eyed, panting around the panties he had fed me. And I loved it. I loved the way he made me feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sobbed into the soaked cotton when he found just the right rhythm, slow, relentless, devastating. The knot inside me twisted tighter and tighter, unbearable, beautiful. I knew he wasn’t ready to let me fall yet. And God, neither was I. I wanted to stay here forever, helpless in his hands, teetering on the brink, knowing he owned every gasp, every shiver, every helpless, aching whimper I couldn&amp;#39;t hold back. Evan’s hand never faltered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slow, devastating circles, each one pushing me closer, closer, until I was standing on the very edge of something wild and bottomless. My thighs shook violently. My breath came in frantic little sobs around the wet cotton stuffed between my lips. Tears burned at the corners of my eyes, blurring the mirror in front of me. I felt it, the pressure coiling low in my belly, tighter and tighter, ready to snap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a voice spoke from beyond the curtain. “Yeah, head to the back pick an empty changing room” the clerk called, too bright, too close. I froze, every muscle locking tight, terror and need crashing together in my veins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evan’s hand never stopped. He only pressed closer against my back, his mouth grazing the shell of my ear, his voice low and dark and commanding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cum for me.. Right now. Stay silent. Stay mine.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The words shattered something inside me. The last of my resistance crumbled. I broke, silently, utterly, my body convulsing against his hand in helpless, wracking waves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The orgasm ripped through me like fire, like drowning, my knees buckling as white heat exploded behind my eyes. I screamed into the panties in my mouth, muffled, desperate, the only sound a low, broken whimper that no one outside would ever hear. I clung to the mirror, trembling violently, every nerve lit and trembling, like I’d been set alight from the inside. Somehow, impossibly, I heard myself whimper, a tiny, pitiful sound, and Evan’s hand slid from between my thighs to steady me, wrapping strong arms around my waist, anchoring me as I sagged against him.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From beyond the curtain, the clerk’s voice came again, distracted now: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Cute dress. You should get it.” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would have laughed if I could breathe. Instead, I melted into Evan’s body, my legs useless, my heart hammering like a wild thing. He held me through it, firm, steady, his thumb stroking lazy circles over my bare hip, grounding me as the aftershocks tore through my trembling frame. And in that moment, bare, undone, silenced by my own soaked lace and shielded by his arms, I had never, ever felt more safe. More wanted. More his.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His mouth found the back of my neck, a slow, lingering kiss that made my knees threaten to buckle all over again. I shuddered under the soft, burning press of his lips, every inch of me quaking from the release he had torn from me with nothing but patience and power. Then his hand slid around, fingers slick with my own need, and he pulled the panties gently from my mouth. I whimpered softly as they left me, the air cool against my wet, swollen lips. He didn’t toss them away. No, I watched through dazed, heavy-lidded eyes as he tucked them into his pocket like something precious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evan turned me gently, maneuvering me backward until the backs of my thighs bumped the little bench. I sank onto it, dazed and flushed, the dress still at my feet. I could still hear the faint hum of the store beyond, the clerk moving, the distant clatter of a hanger sliding on a rack. We weren&amp;#39;t hidden. Not really. And that made the space between us feel electric.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he stood before me, while I sat on the bench, I reached out, fingers brushing along the denim stretched over him, a featherlight touch, a prayer made flesh. He was so hard. I swallowed, my throat dry, my cheeks burning, but I didn’t pull back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to touch him. I wanted to worship him the way he had worshipped. I looked up again, meeting his eyes, wide, pleading, asking without words: Is this what you want? Am I allowed? His nod was small. Barely a tilt of his head. But it cracked the last sliver of restraint inside me. I let my fingers trail higher, up over the zipper, the thick ridge beneath the denim, until I could barely breathe for how badly I needed to touch him.Shaking with aftershocks, I tugged at the button of his jeans, clumsy, fumbling, but he didn’t help. He stood there, watching, letting me work for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally got him undone, dragging the zipper down, the sound loud in the small, charged space. When he freed his cock, my breath caught.Thick. Heavy. Already glistening at the tip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His gaze locked with mine, and he gave a slow, commanding nod, a silent instruction. Suck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I leaned forward instinctively, lips parting, desperate to taste, to worship, to show him how much I needed him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could only serve him with my mouth, obedient, trembling, eager.But just as I got close, just as my breath ghosted over the slick head of him, his hand caught my hair. Firm. Unyielding. Stopping me. I froze, blinking up at him, the ache between my legs sparking fresh and desperate. He didn&amp;#39;t speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shifted his hand, stroking my hair in silent praise, good girl, and then, slowly, deliberately, he fisted the base of his cock. I gasped, couldn&amp;#39;t help it, watching as he stroked his thick shaft right in front of me, slow and steady, his thumb swiping through the wetness already gathering at the tip. It was the most obscene, beautiful thing I had ever seen. I sat there, bare, flushed, body still lit from within from the orgasm he had wrung out of me minutes before, and let him do it. Let him use me as his audience. The world outside blurred into white noise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But somewhere, faint, I caught the low hum of voices: The clerk answering a phone call. Her distracted laugh. Footsteps passing the entrance of the boutique, another shopper maybe, but not stopping. Not looking. We were invisible, and exposed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moaned softly, unable to help myself, pressing my thighs together as Evan’s hand worked over himself with slow, ruthless precision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he gripped the base of his cock with one hand feeding, it to me slowly. I opened without hesitation, lips parting, tongue flicking out shyly to taste the soft, heavy weight of him. He fed himself into my mouth, barely enough to stretch my lips around him, to let me savor the impossible heat and velvet texture of his skin. I sucked gently, reverently, moaning low in my throat as I cradled him with my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The risk. The wrongness. The flimsy curtain shielding us from the public made every moment sharper, hotter. Footsteps again. Loud this time. Close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evan’s hand flexed at the back of my head, urging me to stay steady. Stay good. Another shadow passed the curtain. A laugh. The squeak of sneakers. I flushed crimson but obeyed, keeping my mouth locked around him. He shuddered, a low, broken sound escaping him, but he didn&amp;#39;t let me take more. He pulled back before I could grow greedy, before I could fall fully into worship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I whimpered, aching for him, but stayed still, obedient, desperate, his. He resumed stroking himself, faster now, the muscles of his thighs flexing, his chest rising and falling in ragged heaves. I watched, wide-eyed and hungry, knowing what was coming, knowing it was for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His breathing sharpened, ragged, uneven, and I knew. He stood before me, one hand braced on the wall for balance. I tilted my chin up, offering myself without shame, my heart hammering against my ribs. Thick, hot jets painted my cheeks, my lips, the curve of my jaw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moaned low in my throat, the sound vibrating around the thick weight of emotion swelling in my chest. I didn&amp;#39;t flinch. I didn’t wipe it away.I sat back slightly on the bench, my thighs pressed tightly together, my hands folded obediently in my lap. The mess cooled quickly on my flushed skin, making me hyper-aware of every inch where he had painted me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He exhaled sharply, still trembling as he zipped himself away with quiet, practiced control, his body still trembling from the force of his orgasm. His hand found my chin, a slow, reverent touch, tilting my face up until I had no choice but to meet his eyes. They were so dark. So full. So certain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You’re going to put the dress back on,&amp;quot; he murmured, voice rough but gentle. &amp;quot;And you&amp;#39;re going to fold up your other clothes, nice and neat, and put them in your bag.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blinked up at him, stunned, trembling, but my heart surged with something wild and reckless at the edges of his voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And you&amp;#39;re going to wear the new dress out of here,&amp;quot; he continued, thumb brushing once, so lightly, over the mess cooling on my cheek. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No panties. No bra. Just this...&amp;quot; He lifted the dress off the floor with a finger and presented it to meA small, wicked smile touched the corners of his mouth. &amp;quot;...and me.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slipped the yellow dress back into place, smoothing it down over my bare trembling body. The fabric was so thin, it clung everywhere, outlining not just the shape of my breasts but the pointed peaks of my nipples. Through the soft yellow, I could even see the dusky flush of them, darker than the golden warmth of my olive skin. Every brush of cotton against my sensitive, freshly wrecked body made me shudder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No cleanup. No wiping me off. My breath caught painfully in my chest. The idea of walking out, bare beneath the dress, still marked by him, was almost too much. Walking out of here, flushed, bare under the flimsy sundress, dripping with the proof of him still marking my face, with the clerk none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I stood, the hem swirled around my bare legs, the lightest of touches. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, cheeks flushed, lips kiss-swollen, a faint smear of his release glistening along my jaw. I folded my jeans, sweater and bra with careful, trembling hands, stuffing them into my tote bag, feeling the slickness between my thighs every time I shifted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He took my hand as we slipped from the fitting room. Then, bold, unhurried, his hand slid low, fondling the curve of my bare ass through the thin cotton of the sundress. I gasped, biting my lip hard to muffle the sound. Then, lower. His fingers brushed over the cleft of my cheeks, a teasing, fleeting caress across the most vulnerable part of me. I shuddered, a sharp, helpless jolt, my whole body clenching around the ghost of his touch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Time to go,” he murmured against my ear, voice rich with dark amusement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I think we’re being watched.” My heart stuttered painfully. I risked a quick, terrified glance through the gap in the curtain. There, near the racks of scarves, a woman in her thirties, pretending to browse but sneaking glances our way. She wasn’t frowning. She was smiling. Almost conspiratorial. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heat flooded me, mortification and reckless pride tangling so tightly I couldn&amp;#39;t tell where one ended and the other began. My pulse stuttered. But the way she smiled, like she understood, made me stand straighter instead of hiding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evan’s hand slid down to the small of my back, guiding me forward with a light pressure that brooked no argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Go talk to the clerk,” he said, low and firm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Tell her you’re buying the dress.” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Tell her you’re wearing it out.”I would have to walk across the floor, bare beneath the fluttering sundress, thighs still damp, cheeks still carrying the faint, telltale mark of his claim. Everyone would see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Claire glanced up as we approached.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her gaze swept over Evan first, the lazy power in his stride, then to me. When I reached the counter, the clerk beamed. Claire’s gaze snagged briefly at the faint, visible peaks pressing against the dress’s soft fabric, a small, lingering glance, but she said nothing. Only the slow, knowing curve of her mouth betrayed what she saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Find everything you need?” she chirped. I swallowed, hard, and nodded, forcing my voice to steady even as my hands shook. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’d... I’d like to buy this one,” I said, voice barely above a whisper. The clerk tilted her head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Want me to ring you up and cut the tags off so you can wear it out?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evan slid the tag from the dress’s neckline and handed it to her without a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Claire’s fingers brushed his when she took it. A little too long. A little too curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“All set, hon,” she said, oblivious to the wild, frantic thunder of my heart. I thanked her, or tried to, but the words tangled in my throat. I turned back toward Evan, clutching the receipt, feeling the cool whisper of air against my bare thighs, my still-sensitive skin. My whole body thrummed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time we left the store, my knees barely held me up. Evan took my hand proudly after we exited the store. I clung to him, glowing, ruined, whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mall swallowed us in a rush of light and sound. The crowd bustled obliviously around us, caught up in shopping bags and weekend chatter. The moment we stepped into the open, out of the boutique, into the wide, echoing expanse of polished floors and vaulted skylights, the air felt different. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walked into the light like nothing had happened. But inside, something enormous had shifted. And I didn’t know if I could ever wear yellow again without feeling it, the ache of being wanted, claimed, seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
