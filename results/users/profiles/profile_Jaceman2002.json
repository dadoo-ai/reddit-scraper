    "body": "So I’ve got a whole 220 miles on my ‘23 BRZ. After reading and watching tons of reviews, here is my personal experience so far for prospective buyers.\n\nFor context, some of the cars I’ve owned:\n\n2012 Golf R | wife had a DSG GTI same year\n2015 Audi S4 w/sport diff\n2016 Golf R\n2018 340i M Sport (auto)\n\nOlder cars have been an E30 325e, E28 and E34 535i 5 spd. Mercedes 190E 2.6, and an E36 BMW 323is 5 spd.\n\nMy first car, the 325e, was $100 and needed some work. My cars only got better from there.\n\nLike many of you, I wanted to get a GR86 but not pay a crazy markup. I liked some of the suspension choices on the BRZ, but liked the look of the GR86. Gave up on trying to get one after searching over a year for a Premium Neptune Blue 6MT.\n\nI needed to get a car sooner than later on the off chance I need to start going to the office regularly. I decided to look at getting a BRZ. \n\nA previous customer had a deposit down, but ghosted the dealer when they got allocation so I got next in line!\n\nFast forward to this week I managed to pick it up at a slight discount off MSRP (which feels cool given this crazy market).\n\nOnto the BRZ…\n\nInitial impressions:\n\nSpace: It feels roomy for a small car, and I’m just under 6ft. The trunk is usable. You can fit a gear bag in there. I play paintball, so I’m typically packing an extra pair of shoes and change of clothes without the need to fold the seat down.\n\nStereo: I won’t even try to pretend I’m an audiophile. The stock stereo on the Limited  BRZ isn’t bad. It’s certainly not like the Logic 7 in my 340i, but for a $30k car, that’s low to the ground and chock full a road noise, it’s perfectly fine. If this car had more sound reading material, the stereo might matter more, but it sounds great for cruising around. I don’t feel like I’m missing much between it and the Bose stereo in our small SUV. Compared to some of my very first cars, any modern stereo is going to be better, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt.\n\nRoad noise: It’s def loud, but that’s what you get with a low slung, $30k sports car. My Golf Rs had less road noise, but they were heavier. My 340i had the least road noise, but again, much heavier. If you’re on conference calls a lot, this might not be the car for you.\n\nBlinker detents: Not sure if a TU solved this, but I don’t know what people are talking about with the blinker stalk. The detents are fine, it sounded like there weren’t any before, if this was the case, they are now.\n\nRev hang: I do get some of the criticism, but once you get used to how the car shifts, it’s not as bad as I had read. I get why it is what it is (to help with emissions) , but unless you’re looking for super fast shifts, it’s not bad at all.\n\nOverall, great car for the money. If you can get one, do it. These kinds of cars won’t be around (brand new) in the next 10 years.",
