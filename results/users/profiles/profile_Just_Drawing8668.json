The characters are technologically severed - but we psychologically sever ourselves by compartmentalization all the time. \n \nThe show has done an incredible job of illustrating how deeply ingrained these systems of control are in our daily lives. The contrast between the characters' work personas and their personal lives is stark and unsettling, serving as an illustration of the moral cost of such societal structures.\n\nAs we approach the season finale, I am curious to see how the writers handle the resolution. A happy ending (could be termed a “fan service” ending) - where Gemma is saved, Mark successfully reintegrates, Cobel is recognized for her accomplishments, and Helena overthrows her father - would undermine the entire message that has been built over the first two seasons. It would suggest that personal agency alone is enough to break free from these complex systems. If the systems buckle under the weight of individual decisions -  they truly never had any real power at all. \n\nThis plot line - while making us feel good because the characters we love succeed - would undercut the horror of the entire premise of Severance.  \n\nHowever, a more philosophical ending would take seriously the real contradiction between personal agency and systemic control. The reason these systems enslave us is because in some sense we desire to be controlled. (This theme is the subject of Erich Fromm’s 1941 book Escape From Freedom - or of course 1984.)\n\nTl;dr: if all the characters on the show successfully rebel and take down the system - how powerful a system could it have been in the first place?",

She was one of the first generations of innies and had been working on the severed floor for many years.

Cobel wants to use this new condition to perfect the severed work process, while Gemma wants to liberate the innies - since she finds that her unified self is no longer depressed. They take this disagreement to Helly, who wants to avoid severed liberation at all costs.\n\nThe conflict causes Cobel to conspire with Helly/the board to banish Gemma to the lower levels while she moves up into leadership. They somehow fake Gemma's death on the outside, and Cobel is sent to watch over Mark's Outie, and when she sees his depression, she subliminally guides him towards working on the severed floor.\n\nMark had been beginning to misbehave prior to season 1, that is why Helly is sent as an Innie to watch over him and be a comfort/companion on the severed floor. She is sent in with a subconscious desire to turn towards Mark, implanted in her Innie with technology derived from the unification technique.
