I was running Homebridge behind the same VPN for several months without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone seen anything similar?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I thought getting it through the walls would be the hard part but I was wrong!\n\n[This is the cable](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01M4IVITV/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_dlC_Jb0SFbRXMZQ8A?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) I’m using. I snipped off the provided jacks to make the runs and am re-terminating myself.\n\n[These are](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07L8XZ2X8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_Xd0SFb1P1202F?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) the jacks I’m using.\n\nThis is my first time working with Cat6 so it was a bit of a learning curve with the load bar and drain wire. Perhaps I’m not doing it right.\n\n[This is the crimper](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C571X1P?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) I’m using — do I need anything special to work with a shielded cable?\n\nI foolishly didn’t test the cable as it came out of the box. Now that I have both ends terminated, I have one end in my router and the other in my Mac. The Network pref pane is giving me zippo — as if no cable is connected.\n\nAny thoughts on incompatible gear? Perhaps something a Cat6/shielded noob may be messing up? Troubleshooting ideas?\n\n\\---\n\n**EDIT:** I fixed it. I was putting the load bar in backwards. This YouTube video helped me realize!
