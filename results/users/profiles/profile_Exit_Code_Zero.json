But honestly, that kind of prep doesnâ€™t help much when youâ€™re in a real interview and someone gives you broken code or asks you to explain your thinking.\n\nSo I put together a post about how to practice in a way that actually makes you better.\n\nItâ€™s for anyone trying to become a Salesforce devâ€”whether youâ€™re coming from an admin role, starting out, or trying to move into a more senior position.\n\nThe post covers:\n\n* What kinds of things interviewers look for (debugging, tradeoffs, Flow vs code)\n* Why itâ€™s important to talk through your logic\n* Some common mistakes people make when prepping\n* A few ways to use Forcecode to practice hands-on\n\nIf youâ€™re prepping for interviews right now, I hope this helps you feel more confident and focused.\n\nðŸ‘‰Â [Hereâ€™s the full post](https://forcecode.io/blog/how-to-practice-for-a-salesforce-developer-interview)\n\nWould love to hear how others are practicing too.\n\n",
