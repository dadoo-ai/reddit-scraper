Before approaching the broker, I knew exactly where I stood with the credit agencies.  \n\n**As a happenstance of bad timing, a mistake appeared on my credit report just as the broker pulled my credit for the first time.**  I was shocked that he came back with a credit rating that was MUCH lower than I expected.  Upon further inspection, I saw that the error had NOTHING to do with me or my finances. \n\n**I contacted the credit agencies directly and had the error removed.**  It was removed very quickly, perhaps even on the same day, and my credit rating bounced back up. \n\n**However, I couldn't convince the JW mortgage broker to re-run my credit.** I sent him screenshots of my credit rating and proof that the error was removed from the report.  But he wouldn't budge.  He kept insisting on waiting for an indeterminate amount of time. This made no sense to me, and I was really frustrated, but this was my first time buying a home, and I was new to the process so I didn't know how to proceed. \n\nThe thing is, a pre-approval letter is important if you are going to be taken seriously when putting in an offer on a house.  My home search was time sensitive as my lease was expiring on my duplex in a few months, and I wanted to secure a home before I needed to renew it. \n\nBecause I was confident in my ability to be approved, I moved forward with my home search and toured homes with my very kind (not a JW) real estate agent.  But without a pre-approval in hand, as I was told that this could be gotten very quickly when needed. \n\n**After a couple of weeks of looking, the JW broker was, astonishingly, still unwilling to run my credit. In addition, he took things a step further and contacted my real estate agent and told him that he doubted my creditworthiness.**  \n\nI. Was. Livid.\n\nI called up the JW broker and gave him a piece of my mind.  Why are you trying to prevent me from buying a home?  You are putting me in limbo by purposely stalling the process and telling my agent things that are not true.  \n\n**His patronizing response made it clear that this was all about JW misogyny.**  \"I know better than you.\" \"I am protecting you.\"  \"I am doing the honorable thing by informing your agent.\"  \"You are not ready to search for homes.\"\n\n**Despite the evidence in front of him, he couldn't believe that a single sister (and single parent) could make a professional salary and qualify to buy a nice home.**  He felt the need to control me despite the fact that it ultimately went against his business interests.  \n\nHe also talked about me to other witnesses. I trusted him to give him private financial information, and he gossiped about me with one other family, giving them inaccurate information.\n\n**In the end, I worked with my real estate agent to get another broker, and the process was smooth from then on out.

    "body": "**TLDR:** A man grabbed my shoulders and physically moved me out of the way.  It was unnecessary as I was not in danger. When I confronted him, he tried to mansplain the situation, and made excuses, and tried to deflect. Later, he broke a major (but basic) rule in the game we were playing and tried to insist he was correct. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis is a fairly mild story compared to others I see here, but I didn't like it, and it startled me at the time.  I am struggling to put a label on this behavior - what would you call this?  Also, would you have bothered to address the behavior, and if so, what would you have said?\n\n**Here is the full story:**\n\nI am in a gaming club, and we meet with roughly the same people each week.  I am a woman and considered an experienced member. A new male member of our group came up beside me, we will call him Gary, and asked me a question about the signup sheet in front of us on the table. As I started to answer him, another member, Rick, walked up to look at the sheet.  However, Rick was outside of my peripheral vision. \n\nWhile I was mid-sentence, attempting to answer his question, Gary grabbed my shoulders and physically moved me several inches out of the way.  I was quite startled, not really processing it at the time.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; A man grabbed my shoulders and physically moved me out of the way.  It was unnecessary as I was not in danger. When I confronted him, he tried to mansplain the situation, and made excuses, and tried to deflect. Later, he broke a major (but basic) rule in the game we were playing and tried to insist he was correct. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;__________&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly mild story compared to others I see here, but I didn&amp;#39;t like it, and it startled me at the time.  I am struggling to put a label on this behavior - what would you call this?  Also, would you have bothered to address the behavior, and if so, what would you have said?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the full story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in a gaming club, and we meet with roughly the same people each week.  I am a woman and considered an experienced member. A new male member of our group came up beside me, we will call him Gary, and asked me a question about the signup sheet in front of us on the table. As I started to answer him, another member, Rick, walked up to look at the sheet.  However, Rick was outside of my peripheral vision. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was mid-sentence, attempting to answer his question, Gary grabbed my shoulders and physically moved me several inches out of the way.  I was quite startled, not really processing it at the time.  I  simply walked away after briefly finishing my sentence.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later that night, I was matched against him in a game.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before the game started, I said, &amp;quot;Hey, do you realize that you physically moved me out of the way?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He responded with something like, &amp;quot;Yeah, Rick needed to see the sheet.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I understand that Rick was behind me, but I have never felt the need to physically move another adult out of the way. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started to launch into mansplaining the situation as if I didn&amp;#39;t understand what was happening.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I responded with, &amp;quot;I understand the situation, but again I wouldn&amp;#39;t do that to another adult.

The first bye is listed first, the second goes to the bottom, the third goes to the middle and so-on (See seed lists below)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I am also going to assign table numbers for participants.  Each pair of two will be assigned to the same table&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must be easy to reuse for multiple events, will need to copy/paste new lists of names for randomization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will not necessarily know how many buys beforehand&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The table assignments can be added as a static column, however the drawback is that opponents with buys are assigned to a table.  Ideally these would be excluded from table assignments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seed list for Byes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;64&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;33&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;32&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;48&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;49&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;56&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;41&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;40&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;57&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;60&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;37&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;28&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;44&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;53&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;52&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;45&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;29&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;36&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;61&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;62&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;35&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;46&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;51&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;54&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;43&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;22&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;27&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;38&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;59&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;58&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;39&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;26&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;23&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;42&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;55&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;50&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;47&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;34&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;63&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How it would look with 7 buys:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1,  Bye, Table 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;64, Random Name, Table 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;33, Random Name, Table 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;32, Random Name, Table 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17, Random Name, Table 3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;48, Random Name, Table 3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;49, Random Name, Table 4&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16, Random Name, Table 4&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9, Random Name, Table 5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;56, Random Name, Table 5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;41, Random Name, Table 6&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24, Random Name, Table 6&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25, Random Name, Table 7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;40, Random Name, Table 7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;57, Random Name, Table 8&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8, Random Name, Table 8&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5, Bye, Table 9&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;60, Random Name, Table 9&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;37, Random Name, Table 10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;28, Random Name, Table10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;21, Random Name, Table 11&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;44, Random Name, Table 11&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;53, Random Name, Table 12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12, Random Name, Table 12&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13, Random Name, Table 13&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;52, Random Name, Table 13&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;45, Random Name, Table 14&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20, Random Name, Table 14&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;29, Random Name, Table 15&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;36, Random Name, Table 15&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;61, Random Name, Table 16&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4, Bye, Table 16&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3, Bye, Table 17&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;62, Random Name, Table 17&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;35, Random Name, Table 18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30, Random Name, Table 18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;19, Random Name, Table 19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;46, Random Name, Table 19&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;51, Random Name, Table 20&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14, Random Name, Table 20&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11, Random Name, Table 21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;54, Random Name, Table 21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;43, Random Name, Table 22&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;22, Random Name, Table 22&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;27, Random Name, Table 23&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;38, Random Name, Table 23&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;59, Random Name, Table 24&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6, Bye, Table 24&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7, Bye, Table 25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;58, Random Name, Table 25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;39, Random Name, Table 26&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;26, Random Name, Table 26&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;23, Random Name, Table 27&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;42, Random Name, Table 27&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;55, Random Name, Table 28&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10, Random Name, Table 28&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15 Random Name, Table 29&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;50 Random Name, Table 29&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;47 Random Name, Table 30&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18, Random Name, Table 30&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;31, Random Name, Table 31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;34, Random Name, Table 31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;63, Random Name, Table 32&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2,  Bye, Table 32&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Since she passed, he got married and moved his wife and her kids in along with his kids. A total of 6 people are basically squatting in the property. \n\nThe first step in the process is to go to probate and appoint a personal representative. His lawyer will only draw up the paperwork listing my brother as sole personal representative. They asked me to sign away my rights as personal representative, which I refused to do. I am concerned about him mismanaging the estate and also I don't think that it is a good idea to let him sell the house to himself as he would set the price. \n\nSince he has a lawyer, and things are contentious it has been difficult to find a lawyer who will take my case because there it s really not enough money there to fight an extended probate in court. Maybe $60k after paying off her reverse mortgage. \n\nMy brother is now trying to bully me. How can I  protect my interests?  He filled the court papers listing him as sole personal rep.

She was the last and only reason for me to remain faded and hide certain parts of my life. \r\n\r\nAfter over three years of being unofficially shunned, I was literally swarmed by witnesses. It was unbelievably stressful. As I was going through all of the emotions and realization that I was losing my mother, I had to deal with asinine witness antics and also my own feelings of anger towards them. \r\n\r\nWhen we learned that she wasn't going to make it or even regain consciousness, my brother wanted to call an elder. I was able to put him off for one night. But you know how the witness grapevine is almost faster than the internet and the next day the hospital was swarming with JWs. They were everywhere, and impossible to avoid. \r\n\r\nI asked the hospital staff to not allow \"clergy\" access to the room. Do you think that that stopped them? No way!  I was horrified to walk into her ICU room to see an elder on the HLC and an uber-elderette who I had a falling out with over 15 years ago sitting there. She is literally the last person I would want to see in any situation, but for her to violate my privacy at such a vulnerable time was so incredibly disturbing. The HLC elder was so used to navigating the hospital and having full access that he just waltzed in without checking with staff or family. What a couple of presumptuous fucks. I was pretty proud of my response though. I calmly said hello, set down my bag, turned on my heels and had a conversation with the nurse who promptly ejected them. Later that same sister tried to pump my boyfriend for info, he just bushed her off. They are so used to people kissing their ass, they are puzzled and confused when someone enforces boundaries. \r\n\r\nJWs who had previously decided to pointedly cut me out of their life, were all of a sudden wanting access to me and my unconscious mother. To say that this caused another layer of stress is an understatement. I was trying to balance my emotions with my mom, and the duty to her care (I am the strong,  level-headed of the siblings) and also navigating how to treat others who have treated me poorly by cutting me off. They deserved nothing from me. They especially didn't deserve my precious time and energy which needed to go into saying goodbye and grieving. I struggled to find a balance between not vindictively withholding information and access to my mom and granting them unfettered access to me and her. \r\n\r\nIn my life, I have moved on from my previous JW life and am fortunate enough to have a nice job, a very dedicated, loving and supportive boyfriend, fun hobbies and friends who share them. I have a really happy life, and damn if I am not better than JWs in how I behave and treat others. Despite their idiotic cult-like shunning, I do still have a heart and realize that they cared about my mom and they wanted to see her and say goodbye. I gave them much better than they deserved. \r\n\r\nBut, since they cut me off, they all of a sudden do not not get full access to me as their source of information either. Almost all of them dropped me from Facebook, so guess what? Shocker! You don't get continual updates from me like my FB friends do. I completely ignored refreinding requests and Facebook messages. Some people reached out over text. Some I replied to, most on a delay. Some were allowed to visit. Some barged in anyway...\r\n\r\nOne \"brother\", who was especially close to our family and who has refused to speak to me while simultaneously denying that he is shunning me, was trying to now get in contact with me at the hospital. After I ignored a couple of his texts, he calls my phone. I answer and call him out him out on his bull shit. I said that I was surprised that he was calling me as I haven't heard from him in over two years. He had the audacity to give the excuse that he has been busy. I just said that this is probably not the best time to discuss our relationship but if or when we discuss it, I am not willing to have a fake conversation. You know full well that you have been purposefully avoiding associating with me. I had another conversation with him later about shunning --  he is shunning his bisexual son -- but that is maybe another post. \r\n\r\nNo witness offered help. No witness brought food, to me or my brother. Most of them were preoccupied with their own feelings and barely asked how I was doing. My mom was greatly loved by all and known for her caretaking. But do you think that the congregation would do anything to take care of her family? Nope, not if they are inactive. In contrast my exjw and \"worldly\" friends were wonderful. Such an incredible contrast!\r\n\r\nOne former witness friend flew in and played a song that she said her music producer husband wrote especially for my mother. She played it to my unconscious mother her on her death bed. It obviously wasn't written, recorded and produced in two days. When someone suggested that she send me a copy of the recording, she said that she needed to check with her husband about the \"rights\" to the song. The song wasn't written for her, it was a song he had in his back pocket. Just super weird and unnecessary to tell such a lie. She didn't fly in just for me either. We used to be like sisters from different mothers but I only saw her for 15 min at the hospital and she gave me one brief and weak hug at the service. Sheesh. \r\n\r\nMy mom would have wanted a witness memorial service, so I didn't try to fight it. I debated not attending, but in the end I decided to go. I even custom-designed her memorial cards, including a scripture. It was something that I could do for her.  Even though I am an atheist, I created them for her and she would have wanted a scripture. But, I also put a lot of details about her life on the card. They may view the memorial as another opportunity for indoctrination, but by taking control of the cards I got to also include some honor for her as a person and her life.  My mom loved flowers and my daughter and I also gave away flower bulbs to plant in her honor. Almost 300 people attended. A lot of people helped at the service.  Most people were very sweet at the service itself, the average witness I think without WT control are nice people. \r\n\r\nI have been exhausted and slowly coming to the realization that I am really free now. I am glad that I remained faded for my mom's sake and I will miss her. The only good thing to come out of this is  Watchtower no longer has any leverage to blackmail me with. \r\n\nEdit: typos",

    "body": "Back when I was in the market to purchase a home, I was considering using this JW mortgage broker who was referred to me by my friend's son. This guy was beyond awful.  Instead of treating me as a client he was patronizing, paternalistic and told me that he was doing me a favor.  \n\nWhen I first contacted him he ran an initial credit check. It was much lower than one done a week prior by a different broker. I discovered that there was an error in my credit report that caused my score to go from excellent to mediocre. I contacted the credit bureaus right away and the error was corrected the same day. My credit monitoring service, that I quickly signed up for, showed my score also go back up the same day. \n\nWell for some reason the JW broker refused to believe me. He was very sceptical, this is even after I sent him screenshots of the updated credit monitoring report showing the higher score. He wanted to wait a whole month to rerun my credit check. He thought that running it again may hurt my credit even more (I found out later that this wouldn't have been the case as there are allowances for people shopping for homes and several checks are expected, thus his advice was poor). At this point I hadn't decided to work with him and was now questioning if I should. However, since he was referred by a friend, I thought that I would just wait and see. I had quotes from other brokers too so I had a couple of people who I could go to when I was ready to move forward with a purchase. So I agreed to his recommendation to wait a month and in the meantime I would start looking at houses. \n\nWell this guy did more than just wait.  He actually did detective work to find out who my realtor was. He found him by contacting the original friend's son who referred me.  He made a point of telling my realtor, incorrectly, that I had an issue with my credit. He never came to me with his concerns, Instead he went behind my back and tried to delay my search for a home. \n\nWhen confronted, he defended his actions by saying that he needed to be in communication with the realtor. He said that his conscience drove him to contact my realtor.  I reminded him that I hadn't hired him as my broker yet and that because of this I would not be using his services. After that he sent me these long emails, telling me that he was doing me a favor and that he didn't need the business but it would be in my best interest to use him. And that only he had my best interest at heart because of his relationship with Jehovah and that other worldly brokers would try to rip me off. He had an extremely tin ear and refused to understand my concerns. He took responsibility for nothing and staunchly asserted his rightness, and right, to act in such a presumptuous way.\n\nSo to break it down, he used his old boy JW network to find out information that was not his to have, tried to enforce his own (misinformed) moral stand and treated me in a patriarchal manner. It was all so icky.\n\nIn the end, my realtor -- who was terrific (and not a JW) -- helped me find another broker. Happily, this is long behind me and I have been in my house for over 5 years, with a super low interest rate (take that you stupid JW douche).  Moral of the story is that it is rarely a good idea to do business with a JW, the vast majority of them are not able to be completely professional. \n\nThinking back on this made me mad but also thankful that I am out of that weird cult. Also, I have come so far. We are happy in our home and I have a fantastic boyfriend now to share it with. \n\n\n\n",

Happily, this is long behind me and I have been in my house for over 5 years, with a super low interest rate (take that you stupid JW douche).  Moral of the story is that it is rarely a good idea to do business with a JW, the vast majority of them are not able to be completely professional. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking back on this made me mad but also thankful that I am out of that weird cult. Also, I have come so far. We are happy in our home and I have a fantastic boyfriend now to share it with. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

They were not allowed to have it at the Kingdom Hall,  because he was not an upstanding witness.  I hadn't sat through a JW talk for quite some time and was unable to stifle my reaction to the fear tactics used on people who are in pain and vulnerable.  The talk was delivered in a simple and clear way, and plainly  prompted people to get their lives in line with God's requirements (meaning more closely follow the JW cult).  The words just struck me and the woman behind me noticed the look on my face and she in turn looked shocked at my reaction.  My supportive (and bearded boyfriend) gently let me know that my face was giving my thoughts away. \n\nThe closing prayer was disturbing too.  The elder asked for Jehovah to look into the heart of the dead man to find some good in it,  if only just a \"trace\".  Yes,  he was a drug addict,  but seriously how judgmental can you get about someone's heart? \n\nPeople stood up at the end and told stories about the deceased,  both witness and non witnesses got up and spoke.   I have never been to a memorial where that was done.  I guess it was allowed since it wasn't at the hall. That part was really nice and heartfelt. \n\nThere was a woman in the line for coffee that turned to us and talked about \"our hope\" in the most haunting wide-eyed culty way. It was really bizarre, almost like she was trying to convince herself and me at the same time.  She seemed to try harder when she didn't get a reaction from me confirming my agreement as I only smiled weakly and tried to avoid her intense gaze.    My boyfriend said that he could never imagine me,  even when I was a witness,  talking in such a culty manner. It is true,  I did not. \n\nAfterwards the two of us went out to eat and talked about our families and I shared stories about those who he had just met who used to be a big part of my life. \n\nIt was  good for him to get a little glimpse into my JW upbringing.  I think that it gave him  some insight into this JW past that I have left behind but that still seems to come up all of the time.  Also,  they think that they are giving a good witness at these things,  but the exact  opposite is true,  they are so transparent and left a negative impression. \n\nAll and all,  I am glad that I went.  I did it to support my friend.  In general I am determined to act in a normal and healthy manner,  no matter how unhealthy witness act.  Thus, I do things like show up for funerals.  And bring my boyfriend with me and introduce him to those we meet.  Although I have to admit,  it was a little hard as I knew that I was being judged,  but I powered through.  ",

    "body": "This may be a little technical but since it is easy to establish it may help some witnesses to start to do some real research and not just swallow what is put in front of them.\n\nBasically, in Matthew's attempts to prove that Jesus is Messiah he leaves out several kings in his genealogy.  \n\n&gt; Matthew 1:8 Aʹsa became father to Je•hoshʹa•phat;+\nJe•hoshʹa•phat became father to Je•hoʹram;+\n**Je•hoʹram became father to Uz•ziʹah;**\n\n**Jehoram was not Uzziah's father, Ahaziah was. Three kings in the line are missing, Ahaziah, Joash and Amaziah.**\n\n&gt;Matthew 1:11 **Jo•siʹah+ became father to Jec•o•niʹah+** and to his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.+\n\n**Again there is a king missing. Josiah was not the father of Jeconiah, he was the father of Johoiakim who is not listed.** \n\nWhat does WT say about this?
