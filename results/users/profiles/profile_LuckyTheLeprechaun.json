    "body": "To be honest I'm making this post as part motivation that someone else might see it and realize they can lose the weight, and part selfish pride in what I've accomplished. \n\nI (39m) always been overweight, but after lock-down and my company going full w@h, I really let myself go. Last summer I peaked at 393 lbs, my A1c was up to 6.6(diabetic range), and I was taking 3 meds a day for blood pressure. After suffering some super embarrassing moments like meeting friends for dinner and being too fat to fit in the booth, I decided I had to do something. It took some searching but I was lucky to find a weight loss doctor that didn't want to just push me into surgery or stick me with ozempic/wegovy/etc. Unlike all the others, he was happy to try to work with me on doing it with just diet and exercise. Our first appointment was June 28, 2023.\n\nHow did I do it:\n\n1. It all started with dieting. The Dr set me on as simple a diet plan as possible. Try to stay under 40 grams of carbs a day. Ignore everything else, calories, fat, the only thing I should focus on is carbs. From a practical standpoint my diet can be best described as a lean keto where most meals consistent of protein (chicken and eggs mainly) and low carb veggies (a lot of broccoli, green beans, and cauliflower) with a fair amount of cheese mixed in.\n2. After I was settled into my dieting I started walking daily. It started slow at first but I've been ramping it up over the past 6 months and I now walk 3-4 miles a day. What works for me has been 3 walks a day (one before work, one after lunch, and one after dinner) of about a mile or so. \n3. Also, for the past 6 months I've started working out  every three days. I don't particularly like gyms, so I have a simple weight bench and some dumbells at home and I do a 3-part full body circuit routine that takes around 30 minutes. \n4. Finally, for the past month I've added in going down to my local court and playing basketball (just getting some shots up solo) every three days. So I've basically settled into a 3 day rotation of circuit routine, then basketball, then rest (aside from the walking every day) \n\nSome additional numbers and info:\n\n1. When I started, I was 393 lbs, as of this morning I'm down to 264 lbs. That's a total of 129 lbs lost. \nI've lost 16 inches off my waist and gone from wearing 4XL shirts to now fitting  in XL shirts. \n2. My A1C has dropped from 6.6 down to 5.6. This means I've gone from being in the range that means likely diabetic down to the normal range for adult males. \n3. I've gone from taking 3 medicines for blood pressure a day to taking just one and we're hoping to get rid of that by the end of summer.\n\nSome things I've learned:\n\n1. I've learned not to get too caught in the day-to-day or even week-to-week on the scale. I've had a few periods where I flatlined or even gained weight on the scale only for it all to level out the following week.\n2. Start somewhere, just change one thing and make that a routine. Then once that's a set routine, layer on other things. You don't have to do it all at once, you can build up to it.\n3. Setbacks will happen. I could barely walk for a month over the winter dealing with some plantar fasciitis. Control what you can control and don't hurt yourself trying to overcome things you can't control. \n4. It's OK to cheat and enjoy life. I have a standard schedule where I allow myself one soda per week and a cheat meal every other week. Also, special occasions are just that, and should be treated as such. A piece of cake at your friend's birthday or some of Mom's mac and cheese at Thanksgiving isn't going to instantly ruin weeks/months of progress. \n5. There is no one size fits all. What worked for me may not work for you, but you can find something that will work. \n\nI'm not done, my goal is to get down to at least 200 lbs so I still have 64 lbs to go, but I can't help but feel proud of what I've done. If anyone has actually made it this far and has questions please feel free to ask.",

It was never really about the money (at least not after I graduated college and got a real job) but I enjoyed it so I kept on doing it.  \n\nOf course, it wasn't always sunshine and roses. Crazy parents, troubled kids, etc are just something I learned to deal with over the years, but 90% of the time though people policed their own.  If a parent was acting up then some other parent on their side would step in.  If a player was playing dangerously or overly-aggressive the Coaches would step in and...well...coach.  Overall I would say that I would only have to do something drastic (eject a player, coach, or parent) once or twice a year.\n\nIn the last few years though, I saw a change.  A lot of people want to blame it on \"kids these days\" but that's not what it looked like from my perspective.  The kids were the same as always, kids will always push boundaries up until they get pushed back on by an authority figure...that's how they learn. And that's where I started to see the change.  Somewhere along the line, the mantra of coaches/parents taking responsibility for the actions of their kids got flipped on it's head.  More often than not the adults would just blindly defending their own kids.  \n\nAnd this takes me back to Kerr, and as an extension many of the modern \"players coaches\".  I get that it's hard to hold pro players accountable when they aren't kids and often are far less expendable to the franchise than you are. However just like the players are role models for young players, these coaches get propped up as examples for youth coaches.  So when Steve Kerr has his press conference where once again he pretends like Draymond did nothing wrong, that's how these youth coaches think they should behave.\n\nI don't think this is anything that's going to change, at least not anytime soon. And maybe I just sound like an old man yelling at clouds...or just some former ref bitching, but I wanted to just write my thoughts down and see if anyone may have experienced the same or similar.",

Outside of Smart no player has more than two years of NBA experience. And none of those players has averaged more than 15 minutes per game.\n* No obvious go-to player to carry the scoring load on offense.
