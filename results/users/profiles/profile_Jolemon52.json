    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When The Force awakens trailer came out, Funny or Die did a video review of it in which George Lucas and ghost Anakin watched the trailer and freaked out. Here’s a link to an article that references it: &lt;a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Watch-George-Lucas-React-Star-Wars-7-Trailer-68537.html\"&gt;https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Watch-George-Lucas-React-Star-Wars-7-Trailer-68537.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of the video that may help are Lucas and ghost Anakin sitting in front of a computer. Once they see Kyle Ren’s lightsaber hilt beams they pause the video and begin to talk shit on it for the rest of the video until Anakin fades out.

One evening as he and his co-worker were shutting down the store they began chatting about their current school work as they were both in college.\n\nHis co-worker opined about the books she needed for her nursing class. This class on its own had books costing up to $400.  She was considering dropping the class because of it.\n\nIn a corner of the store, a well known blind spot was occupied by a customer who had been there for hours.

While I enjoy their music, I never vibed with the dead like someone who may frequent this Reddit. \n\nThis story goes that my dad was the biggest Grateful Dead fan I ever met. In 1973, at the age of 18 he moved to San Fran from New\nYork because that’s where the Dead were. He went to countless shows and collected countless merch over the years. Often growing up, I would ask my parents where they were during such and such. Most often, my dad would recount being at a dead show. \n\nMy dad and I were very very close when I was a child. However, my mom and him split up around the time I began my teenage adolescence. This proved too much for our relationship. By the time I was 15 we were no longer talking or hanging out. That year he died of colon cancer at 52. \n\nThe things he left my sister, mom and I were various things of a single middle aged man: a car for my sister, stocks for my mom, and Grateful Dead stuff for me.\n\nThat was almost 15 years ago. Everywhere I go I’ve brought with me my fathers box of Grateful Dead shirts, never know what I would do with them. While I want to hold on to them, I think it’s finally time to let them go. \n\nMy love for my father will live on as long as I’m alive. But these things aren’t him. I’m ready to move on from them. I want to sell them to true lovers of the dead. \n\nIf anyone has knowledge on what these things are worth, where a good place to sell them is, or if there’s anyone looking to purchase something, please let me know. \n\nBest wishes,\nSon of the dead",
