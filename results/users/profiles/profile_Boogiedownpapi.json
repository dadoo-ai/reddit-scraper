Because of this, the roster has WAY too many fighters to follow. The reality is that as soon as an up and comer loses, their hype is derailed. We likely will never see another Charles Oliveira again because most guys don't get that many chances to come back and go on a win streak. Ranked fights move the needle for casuals and hardcores. We don't get enough of them anymore because they're pay walled save the one you get per week on fight night\n\nSecond, the conor effect. Champs don't want to stack defenses when they can go for double champ status. There's barely any movement towards the top of any division because of politics. No one is going to be what Conor was, it's just not possible anymore. \n\nLast, MMA has evolved in the UFC. I say this specifically because you watch ONE and it just doesn't look the same. Safe wrestling is just the base for winning now. Couple that with the pressure to win or get set back MILES from contendership, and you get some pretty not entertaining wrestling. Guys used wrestling to ragdoll their opponents before. Now? It's a lot of grab, drag, cage pins, and do just enough. Fans love to say that casuals don't love grappling, but watch Matt Hughes wrestle versus watching the average wrestler today. It's just not as fun to watch (even though everyone is better at grappling and defending, I'll give credit there)\n\nMMA as a sport is still fun as hell to watch, but the UFC is just a little too much and harder to stay interested",
