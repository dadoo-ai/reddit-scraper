    "body": "Some people, who have never read the Immigration and Nationality Act, don't seem to realize that the only reason people have these appointments to begin with is because they *could* be in detention under the INA and these check-ins are offered *as an alternative to* detention, but detention remains legally authorized by the INA in most cases. \n\nIn this case, she was already ordered to be deported in 2006, and though the government did not act on the order until now, it probably never forfeited its right to act on it. 8 U.S.C. § 1231 does not say that a final order of removal expires or becomes invalid after the 90-day period, it only addresses the question of how and why an alien may be detained or supervised after the 90-day period is over.\n\nIn the complaint, her lawyers say:\n\n&gt;When a noncitizen is ordered removed, the attorney general shall remove that \nperson within a period of 90 days. The Respondents detain and seek to effectuate the removal some \n19 years after the removal period has lapsed.

I started out with a Werner Desperado, then upgraded to a G'Power Twister X-Creek which I cracked going over a weir in Spain. So I've tried both ends of the spectrum.\n\nNow I'm paddle shopping again. Since I live in flat-ass Germany now a lot of my paddling has been expedition paddling elsewhere in the world where I use whatever paddle is on hand at the destination. Some of my best paddling was done with a noodly Werner Rio in Mexico. \n\nI'm totally open to the idea that stiff, expensive carbon paddles would make a big difference in performance. I used to be a Nordic ski racer and the difference between cheap and expensive ski poles was night and day. But with paddles, I don't feel it. \n\nI just noticed the Accent Rage Advantage and I'm thinking about getting one to stash in the USA for use on my trips home. It's affordable, the bright orange blades will be easy to see in the black New England waters, and the molded grips on the shaft are interesting - I remember Corran Addison talking about how he loved grips like those in the 90s, and brought them back with his Powerstick paddle.  \n\nAm I dumb for considering this?",

    "title": "Police staffing in Burlington: A proposal based on global best practices",
    "communityName": "r/burlington",
    "parsedCommunityName": "burlington",
    "body": "Solving Burlington's social ills requires many parallel efforts beyond policing, but today I want to hone in on the issue of police staffing specifically, inspired by many recent comments like this one:\n\n&gt;Someone was shooting up outside at my apt yesterday, I called 911, was told “we don’t have an officer to respond but if she tries to get into your apt to call back and we’ll send a fire truck.” I responded with, \"I’ll hit her with a baseball bat. I’ve got kids and I don’t have time to wait for y’all.\" The dispatcher didn’t like that. My neighbor got home and called when she saw the lady having a seizure.\n\nSo I thought it would be good for us to look at some best practices from around the world and draw up a staffing model that is adequate for Burlington's current needs. \n\nThe first thing we need to understand is that the US model of independent municipal police departments is a global outlier, and as long as Burlington sticks to this model, it will never be happy with its police department. It will never be able to get the necessary economies of scale, recruitment and specialization on its own. That's why we need to transition to a statewide policing model similar to Germany’s. This proposal draws much inspiration from the organizational chart of the [Landespolizei Bremen](https://www.polizei.bremen.de/dienststellen/organigramme-der-polizei-bremen-37250), which serves a population similar in size to Vermont. I will use German terminology throughout here. \n\nThe basic unit of policing in Germany is the [*streifenwagen*](https://www.saarbruecker-zeitung.de/imgs/03/1/4/5/9/1/7/5/4/1/tok_bd369fc9c7ab6a2990dabd7b2c1d81fe/w1100_h688_x1796_y1347_Foto_11.08.22__11_09_32-ca2cbb58b0fb55dc.jpg), or patrol car, with two officers - always two, never one alone. It's crazy, when you think about it, that the US has so many lone-wolf police officers on patrol out there all by themselves. It's dangerous for the officers and by extension, dangerous for the citizens they come into contact with. \n\nUnder normal circumstances, Burlington could be adequately served with a shift strength of six officers, manning three *streifenwagen* each covering a sector of the city - north, central, and south. But Burlington is currently full of antisocial zombies who are constantly running amok, so we need to supplement these units in a way that only a statewide police force can. \n\nFusing together concepts from Japan and Berlin, a [kōban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dban) should be placed at City Hall Park. This would be staffed by four officers per shift of what Berlin calls the [*Brennpunkt- und Präsenzeinheit*](https://twitter.com/PolizeiBerlin_E/status/1354711004446412800), a unit dedicated to watching over areas of intensive criminality. One officer would man the desk in the kōban while the other three patrol and respond by foot and motorcycle along Burlington's \"axis of evil\", roughly comprising City Hall Park, Church Street, the bus terminal, and Elmwood Avenue. \n\nOn weekend nights when the bars are letting out, the standard units would be complimented by an [*Einsatzzug*](https://www.polizei.bremen.de/sixcms/media.php/25/direktion_e2.jpg) of one of the [*Einsatzhundertschäfte*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzhundertschaft), a large mobile group of officers who can be deployed around the region as needed. This capability exists in all of the German *Landespolizei* agencies, even the small ones like Bremen, but it is completely missing from the US police landscape. Deployment of a *Zug* would provide roughly 30 extra officers in the city at times when things are most likely to be out-of-control. It's a more permanent and organized version of the Vermont State Police deployments [Burlington was paying for on weekends last fall](https://vtdigger.org/2022/10/06/vermont-state-police-to-patrol-in-burlington-under-new-agreement/). \n\nLastly, a regional special unit called the *Unterstützungsstreife* would be based in Burlington with a shift strength of ten. Based on the [USE](https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article232392991/neue-spezialeinheit-bei-der-hamburger-polizei-unterstuetzungsstreife-hamburg-sicherheit.html) of the Hamburg police, this unit is available to respond to any situation in which the patrol officers need additional support or equipment, such as the recent case where a burglar had [barricaded themselves in a garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEmnH9QRWVc). This unit would be available to respond throughout northwestern Vermont, but most of their operations are likely to be in and around Burlington. The purpose of this unit is to bridge the gap between normal patrol units and the [*Spezialeinsatzkommando*](https://www.hamburger-allgemeine.de/50-jahre-spezialeinsatzkommandopolizei-feiert-jubilaeum-mit-uebung/) (analogous to the VSP's Tactical Services Unit) which responds to the most serious situations. \n\nUnfortunately, our politicians know little to nothing about policing and can't be bothered to research or conceive these kinds of concepts, so have fun being told that they could maybe send a fire truck to your impending home invasion.",

    "body": "Ever since I was in high school, I've been ripping around on a pair of K2 Public Enemies.

Clay](https://old.reddit.com/r/wmnf/comments/vgn17q/hypothermic_hiker_rescued_near_mt_clay_dies_in/). The video of that rescue got me thinking about what I would wear if I was dispatched to find someone above treeline in those conditions. It's a real challenge because these winter-in-the-summer storms are so insidious: soaking rain down low, ferocious winds and below-freezing-temperatures up high. It's the definition of extreme, and conventional outdoor clothing made for conventional outdoor conditions won't cut it. So here is my *un*conventional approach to dressing for the worst weather. I hope that by sharing it, you will discover some interesting gear that you didn't know about before. \n\nWe start at the trailhead. Temps in the 40s and raining. The goal down here is not to soak ourselves with sweat as we are hoofing it up to the treeline. For this, we can turn to a company that has a unique focus not on waterproofness, but on \"virtual dryness.\" Buffalo Systems of Sheffield, UK have been making their [\"Double P\" system garments](https://www.buffalosystems.co.uk/about/our-story/) in Sheffield for the last 40 years, and while not well known on this side of the Atlantic, people from the wet and windy highlands of Scotland vouch for their performance. \n\nThe idea is simple: plain Pertex on the outside, pile fleece on the inside, worn next to skin - no baselayers. The pile fleece wicks away moisture and vent zippers can be opened and closed to prevent overheating. For this mission I'm taking their [Special 6 shirt and trousers](https://www.buffalosystems.co.uk/products/special-6-shirt/) to be my first (and below treeline, only) body layer. \n\nOn feet, a shoe like the [Salewa Dropline Mid](https://www.salewa.com/dropline-mid-mens-shoe-00-0000061386) supports moving quickly over the terrain. To stay comfortable, I opt for a two-piece sock system made by German motorcycle brand Klim. Their [Covert GORE-TEX Sock](https://www.klim.com/Covert-Gore-Tex-Sock-3079-001) comes with a Coolmax liner sock and GORE-TEX outer sock. I have used GORE-TEX Socks in rotten spring conditions in the Whites IRL and their performance is very good. Compared to a standard GTX hiking shoe, the Covert socks bring the waterproof protection higher up your leg and allow you to wear non-waterproof mesh shoes that dry faster when taken off your feet. \n\nI find jacket hoods annoying, and the Special 6 shirt doesn't have one, so I will take a rain hat like the OR Seattle Sombrero to use below treeline. \n\nAbove treeline, the penetrating winds demand heavier-duty protection; the plain Pertex of the Special 6 shirt and trousers will not be windproof enough. So I reach for one of the baddest separate waterproof tops on Earth: the [Musto HPX Ocean Pro Smock](https://www.musto.com/en_de/pro-series-hpx-dry-smock-80789). It's made of extra-heavy-duty GORE-TEX Pro fabric with latex neck and wrist seals. It's the top of choice for ocean racing sailors who are constantly exposed to high winds and doused with waves while standing at the helm. The price is high, but you can get them cheaper on eBay sometimes.\n\nFor pants, I would pair the HPX Smock up with the [Rab Latok GTX bibs](https://rab.equipment/eu/latok-gtx-bib-qwh-42#) because they have full side zips and can go on over the rest of our ensemble. \n\nFor head protection I will go with a [Musto Championship Aqua Balaclava](https://www.musto.com/en_gb/champ-aqua-balaclava-20-86051) layered under a [CeAn XT4 helmet with a tilt visor](https://imgur.com/a/SoD2zVK) that resists fogging and freezing precipitation. A light can be mounted on the side of the helmet or carried on a chest harness to avoid interfering with the visor. \n\nGloves for cold wet weather are difficult to find; the few good models that have been offered by outdoor brands are all discontinued right now. Andrew Skurka tried many options and recommended the [Showa Atlas TemRes 282-02](https://www.go2marine.com/showa-282-temres-gloves?quantity=1&amp;size=852). I'll bring a primary and backup pair. \n\nAnd to carry it all, I like this [Ferrino Instinct 40+5](https://www.ferrino.it/en/shop-en/equipment/backpacks/mountaineering/75654lww-backpack-instinct-405.html) backpack with a big center zipper. \n\nIn conclusion - I might look ridiculous, but I am pretty sure I will be the most comfortable person out there.",

    "body": "We can't escape it. Every day, we sit on this subreddit and read a stream of discontent about the Burlington Police Department. Whether through their action(s) or inaction, no one is ever satisfied with their performance, and it seems that no one wants to work for them anymore either. But despite this dismal state of affairs, only a few token ideas have been proposed to reform the practice of law enforcement in Burlington. Hire a couple of social workers here, express some non-specific desires for more training and accountability there...none of these things are going to move the needle. As long as the BPD continues to exist in its current form and operate the way it has been charged with operating, it's only a matter of time before we go back to square one and [Harmony Edosomwan returns to burn down One North Avenue](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/george-floyds-death-spurs-vermonters-to-call-for-police-reform/Content?oid=30519222) like she promised to do in May of 2020. As long as you have more than 800,000 armed police officers in this country spontaneously interacting with a population that is awash in hundreds of millions of firearms, shit is sure to go down. And activists are not in the habit of poring over charts to see if the number of people killed by police is going down year-over-year. All it takes is one more shot, one more body cam video, and the city will go to the torch again. The only way to reduce that risk, in the long run, is to drastically reduce the number of contacts between police and citizens. \n\nObviously, the best way to do that is to reduce desperation in the population. Crime and disorder follows desperation, as surely as night follows day, as the pandemic and its follow-on inflationary pressures have demonstrated in Burlington. And while there are lots of good ideas about how to reduce desperation, let's focus on the other side of the equation here: Let's talk about how we can restructure policing in a way that reduces the number of contacts between police and citizens...\n\n* Without leaving citizens feeling like they are defenseless\n* Without allowing criminals to operate with impunity\n* While maintaining our capabilities to repond to emergencies\n\nLet's start with a bit of history [1](https://www.academia.edu/30504361/The_History_of_Policing_in_the_United_States). Until the year 1848, there were no police departments in America. Sure, there were courts, and laws, and you could be convicted of a crime, but there were no police departments - that means no concept of police \"going on patrol\" or \"answering calls\" or \"pulling people over.\" Law enforcement was purely reactive in nature; there were no random encounters with police in daily life. \n\nOnce police departments did appear, they were mostly a means of controlling \"disorder\" among the burgeonining urban underclass created by the Industrial Revolution, to the extent that it threatened the workforce needs of the capitalist class (factory and mine owners). Police forces were used to suppress organized labor (see: The Pennsylvania State Police), were associated with slave patrols (see: any number of thinkpieces on the Internet), and were used as tools of political intimidation by local party bosses. Corruption and brutality among American police forces reached now-unthinkable levels during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The idea of professional police officers who \"protect and serve\" didn't come around until about 1930; that ideal is younger than some of our grandparents.\n\nWe don't even have time right now to discuss the social construction of crime, and how entire categories of criminality from \"vagrancy\" to \"jaywalking\" to \"marijuana possession\" were conjured out of thin air as excuses to harass and imprison certain groups of people. What we need to talk about is the fact that the number of police forces in America has gone from zero in 1847 to more than 18,000 today - a hundred times more than you would find in any other country. [Sweden has one police force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Police_Authority). China has [~three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_China). The United States has innumerable police forces at every level of government, from [Federal Agencies](http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/fedcars/gov.html) to [State Police forces](http://www.policecarwebsite.net/state.html) to [county-level Sheriff's Departments](http://www.policecarwebsite.net/city3.html) to [colleges](http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/school/uvm102.jpg), [railroads](http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/transit/up114.jpg), and even [school districts](https://www.facebook.com/kleinisdpd/posts/pfbid02pHNhhAGEsC2tZgrf8tGxbm1poB7EjYLVdD1nMzvvxu22yorY4L3DrQajd91NytnHl). So when we say that we want to get rid of the Burlington Police, it doesn't mean that all law enforcement capability ceases to exist. It's about eliminating the largest and most frequently problematic tier of the policing pyramid (municipal police) and rebalancing their responsibilities across other tiers of government as well as new categories of responders who do not exist yet. So let's do that exercise. \n\n&gt;*\"I'm not afraid to say we really do not need police officers,\" [Edosomwan told the crowd](https://vtdigger.org/2020/06/05/live-updates-racial-justice-protests-in-vermont/). \"If we had community councils and community gatherings, it would not only strengthen our communities, but we'll see that a world is possible without living in a police state.\"*   \n\nShe's right, you know. There is enormous power in the community knowing its neighbors and having mechanisms to call the problematic ones out on their shit. But I think that in order to replace the BPD fully, we still need some professionals who are well-equipped to work in various areas. I propose to redistribute and reassign the tasks of the municipal police force to four categories of professionals:\n\n* **Problem Solvers.** These are respected people in the community who can find out who is causing problems, understand the root cause, and get them to change their ways. They can deal with fireworks, vandalism, trashy behavior, and other quality-of-life issues. They can be the facilitators and the instigators of the community-based restorative justice that Harmony Edosomwan envisions. These people exist on a limited basis right now, but we need to find ways to professionalize, compensate, and empower them so that they can work in a much more impactful way. \n* **Investigators.** Bike stolen? Car window smashed? It's not like the BPD is doing much in this area anyway. They never found the thief who took my backpack. The State Police will investigate major and violent crimes, while investigation of petty property crimes could be outsourced to private detective agencies who can take whatever evidence they find to court. Reducing desperation is the only real way to make a dent in property crime, as we discussed earlier. \n* **Non-lethal interventionists.** I think we need two categories of these. One to respond to mental health crises (\"emotionally disturbed persons\" in the NYPD lexicon) and one to respond to domestic violence issues. I find inspiration in the non-profit organizations of Germany which are fully integrated into the emergency dispatch system, like the [Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund](https://www.asb.de/en) for medical emergencies and the [DLRG](https://www.dlrg.de/) for water rescue. These services could be provided in Burlington and throughout Vermont by regional outposts (German: *Ortsverbände*) of state and national organizations set up for the purpose. The state should contract with them for such services and make sure they are funded and equipped for serious action. \n* **[Lethal inverventionists.](https://image.bz-berlin.de/data/uploads/2022/07/wa_86_50jahre_sel_teil_2.jpg?impolicy=channel&amp;imwidth=992)** This is your last option. When the shooting has already started and lives are in danger, somebody's got to deal with it. The key is to ensure that you are using these resources to *respond* to violent situations and not to *create* them - paring back the mission creep that has affected SWAT teams in service of the War on Drugs ever since the 1990s. \n\nThe [VSP Tactical Services Unit](https://vsp.vermont.gov/specialteams/tactical#:~:text=The%20Vermont%20State%20Police%20Tactical,law%20enforcement%20agencies%20in%20Vermont.) is and will remain the primary means of lethal intervention in the state. But with municipal police forces gone, their response time can be long in this era of active shooters. I have toyed with the idea of creating a local-level [STOP team](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Bilder/DE/Arbeitsbereiche/Ermittlungsunterstuetzung/mek_neu.jpg) consisting of volunteers that could be hastily deployed as a counter-assault team in the event of an active shooter. Each member would be vetted and confirmed by the City Council, and there would be some form of civilian oversight to authorize their deployment, like the system used to launch nuclear weapons. Training and communications standards would have to be developed. \n\nWhere are the county sheriffs in all of this? I would like them to go back to their old reactive role of serving warrants and summonses issued by the courts. In Vermont, Sheriff's Departments can contract with municipalities that have no police department of their own to provide law enforcement services, which as far as I can see means mostly policing-for-profit traffic enforcement details. Traffic stops are another huge source of unnecessary and potentially dangerous police-citizen interactions; in Germany they are rare, and speeding fines are usually doled out through the use of speed cameras instead of traffic stops. I think we only have to wait a few more years until the self-driving revolution renders traffic enforcement obsolete; maybe we can lean more heavily on IoT, drones, and other technologies until them to reduce the need for blue-light traffic stops. The VSP can fill the interceptor role of catching drunk and wrong-way drivers that pose an immediate threat to the public until their cars gain the ability to drive their drunk asses home. \n\nSpeaking of the VSP, is it possible for them to take up all of the slack left behind when municipal departments are gone? Sure it is. There's plenty of international precedent for that, even without all the reforms we discussed above. The \"Medical and University City of Erlangen\" in Germany, population 116,000, is basically the city that Burlington wishes it could grow up to be. It has no municipal police force. Neither does Nuremberg just down the road, (pop. 518,000). Both fall under Polizeipräsidium Mittelfranken of the Bavarian *Landespolizei*. Having everything under a single department and a single chain of command makes it easier to promulgate standards and ensure transparency. It should also be noted that in Germany, the uniformed patrol elements (Security police, or *Schutzpolizei*) are organizationally somewhat distinct from the Criminal police or *Kriminalpolizei*, which are the detectives who investigate major crimes. So in Bavaria, in addition to the *Landespolizei*, there is a parallel organization called the [*Landeskriminalamt*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayerisches_Landeskriminalamt) that carries out investigations. The federal equivalents are the [Bundespolizei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Police_(Germany))) and the [Bundeskriminalamt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Criminal_Police_Office_(Germany)). We could do a whole additional post about reorganizing law enforcement at the federal level, but this has gone on long enough. \n\nI really don't think that our political leaders have the imagination and breadth of knowledge needed to conceive any of this. Too many people participating in this debate just think that \"the police\" is \"the police\" and don't do the work of breaking policing down into its constituent parts and capabilities. A better future *is* possible. But we haven't even figured out where to start.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t escape it. Every day, we sit on this subreddit and read a stream of discontent about the Burlington Police Department. Whether through their action(s) or inaction, no one is ever satisfied with their performance, and it seems that no one wants to work for them anymore either. But despite this dismal state of affairs, only a few token ideas have been proposed to reform the practice of law enforcement in Burlington. Hire a couple of social workers here, express some non-specific desires for more training and accountability there...none of these things are going to move the needle. As long as the BPD continues to exist in its current form and operate the way it has been charged with operating, it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before we go back to square one and &lt;a href=\"https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/george-floyds-death-spurs-vermonters-to-call-for-police-reform/Content?oid=30519222\"&gt;Harmony Edosomwan returns to burn down One North Avenue&lt;/a&gt; like she promised to do in May of 2020. As long as you have more than 800,000 armed police officers in this country spontaneously interacting with a population that is awash in hundreds of millions of firearms, shit is sure to go down. And activists are not in the habit of poring over charts to see if the number of people killed by police is going down year-over-year. All it takes is one more shot, one more body cam video, and the city will go to the torch again. The only way to reduce that risk, in the long run, is to drastically reduce the number of contacts between police and citizens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the best way to do that is to reduce desperation in the population. Crime and disorder follows desperation, as surely as night follows day, as the pandemic and its follow-on inflationary pressures have demonstrated in Burlington. And while there are lots of good ideas about how to reduce desperation, let&amp;#39;s focus on the other side of the equation here: Let&amp;#39;s talk about how we can restructure policing in a way that reduces the number of contacts between police and citizens...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Without leaving citizens feeling like they are defenseless&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Without allowing criminals to operate with impunity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While maintaining our capabilities to repond to emergencies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with a bit of history &lt;a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/30504361/The_History_of_Policing_in_the_United_States\"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. Until the year 1848, there were no police departments in America. Sure, there were courts, and laws, and you could be convicted of a crime, but there were no police departments - that means no concept of police &amp;quot;going on patrol&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;answering calls&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pulling people over.&amp;quot; Law enforcement was purely reactive in nature; there were no random encounters with police in daily life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once police departments did appear, they were mostly a means of controlling &amp;quot;disorder&amp;quot; among the burgeonining urban underclass created by the Industrial Revolution, to the extent that it threatened the workforce needs of the capitalist class (factory and mine owners). Police forces were used to suppress organized labor (see: The Pennsylvania State Police), were associated with slave patrols (see: any number of thinkpieces on the Internet), and were used as tools of political intimidation by local party bosses. Corruption and brutality among American police forces reached now-unthinkable levels during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The idea of professional police officers who &amp;quot;protect and serve&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t come around until about 1930; that ideal is younger than some of our grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t even have time right now to discuss the social construction of crime, and how entire categories of criminality from &amp;quot;vagrancy&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;jaywalking&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;marijuana possession&amp;quot; were conjured out of thin air as excuses to harass and imprison certain groups of people. What we need to talk about is the fact that the number of police forces in America has gone from zero in 1847 to more than 18,000 today - a hundred times more than you would find in any other country. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Police_Authority\"&gt;Sweden has one police force&lt;/a&gt;. China has &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_China\"&gt;~three&lt;/a&gt;. The United States has innumerable police forces at every level of government, from &lt;a href=\"http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/fedcars/gov.html\"&gt;Federal Agencies&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"http://www.policecarwebsite.net/state.html\"&gt;State Police forces&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"http://www.policecarwebsite.net/city3.html\"&gt;county-level Sheriff&amp;#39;s Departments&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/school/uvm102.jpg\"&gt;colleges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/transit/up114.jpg\"&gt;railroads&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kleinisdpd/posts/pfbid02pHNhhAGEsC2tZgrf8tGxbm1poB7EjYLVdD1nMzvvxu22yorY4L3DrQajd91NytnHl\"&gt;school districts&lt;/a&gt;. So when we say that we want to get rid of the Burlington Police, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that all law enforcement capability ceases to exist. It&amp;#39;s about eliminating the largest and most frequently problematic tier of the policing pyramid (municipal police) and rebalancing their responsibilities across other tiers of government as well as new categories of responders who do not exist yet. So let&amp;#39;s do that exercise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not afraid to say we really do not need police officers,&amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2020/06/05/live-updates-racial-justice-protests-in-vermont/\"&gt;Edosomwan told the crowd&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;If we had community councils and community gatherings, it would not only strengthen our communities, but we&amp;#39;ll see that a world is possible without living in a police state.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s right, you know. There is enormous power in the community knowing its neighbors and having mechanisms to call the problematic ones out on their shit. But I think that in order to replace the BPD fully, we still need some professionals who are well-equipped to work in various areas. I propose to redistribute and reassign the tasks of the municipal police force to four categories of professionals:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Solvers.&lt;/strong&gt; These are respected people in the community who can find out who is causing problems, understand the root cause, and get them to change their ways. They can deal with fireworks, vandalism, trashy behavior, and other quality-of-life issues. They can be the facilitators and the instigators of the community-based restorative justice that Harmony Edosomwan envisions. These people exist on a limited basis right now, but we need to find ways to professionalize, compensate, and empower them so that they can work in a much more impactful way. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigators.&lt;/strong&gt; Bike stolen? Car window smashed? It&amp;#39;s not like the BPD is doing much in this area anyway. They never found the thief who took my backpack. The State Police will investigate major and violent crimes, while investigation of petty property crimes could be outsourced to private detective agencies who can take whatever evidence they find to court. Reducing desperation is the only real way to make a dent in property crime, as we discussed earlier. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-lethal interventionists.&lt;/strong&gt; I think we need two categories of these. One to respond to mental health crises (&amp;quot;emotionally disturbed persons&amp;quot; in the NYPD lexicon) and one to respond to domestic violence issues.

Since I am guilty of being one of them, I wanted to share three pieces of gear that can increase your comfort and safety in such extreme conditions:   \n\n\n1. [Swenor Biathlon Visor](https://www.sefiles.net/merchant/2622/images/large/Swenor\\_Snow\\_Visor\\_Clear.jpg) - this thing is so clutch. Originally designed to shield the eyes of [biathletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon) from falling snow, it is your best friend in wind-driven rain. The angle of the shield can be changed to meet the incoming rain while maintaining a view of the trail in front of your feet, and it is not vulnerable to fogging or icing like conventional sunglasses or goggles. As a bonus, the headband can be used to hold your hood in place in extreme winds. \n2. [Black Diamond Waterproof Overmitts](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/product/waterproof-overmitts/) - the three-layer, seam-taped construction of these mitts provides more effective protection than bladder-type waterproof gloves that absorb water between the face fabric and the waterproof bladder. Wear them over wicking liner gloves and your hands will be toasty in the worst wet-and-windy weather.\n3. [Bothy Bag](https://rab.equipment/us/group-shelter-2#) - used by Scottish hill-walkers to get out of the weather where natural shelter is unavailable, the bothy bag could save your life if you get caught out like that guy on Mount Clay this weekend. This pole-less shelter uses your body as a structure, and if you share it with a friend it will warm up inside. It can be deployed even in severe winds. \n\nIt goes without saying that a three-layer rain jacket and pants are *de rigeur* for these conditions. I use the Jottnar Hymir pullover and Arc'Teryx Zeta AR pants. It's important not to over-dress under these waterproof layers, as this will cause you to soak yourself in sweat. Mesh cycling baselayers are a good choice; Millet's DRYNAMIC 3D MESH baselayers were the gold standard but sadly no longer available. All the best outdoor gear pieces get discontinued too soon.",

    "body": "You know, in the beginning...I was down with the mission. \n\nI was once one of those people who went around on Facebook arguing with Corona deniers, telling them why the virus wasn't \"just another flu\", why their analogies to car crashes and mosquitoes flying through chain-link fences were shit, and why lockdowns were needed to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. \n\nAnd look at me now. My rage is incandescent as I rail against public-health measures in every reddit thread that I can find. The man with the fancy liberal-arts degree, who was once the most implacable enemy of Donald Trump and the Republican Party, has become the most strident voice against COVID precautions in all of their forms. \n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThe story began on February 25th, 2020. I was in my backyard when I saw a headline on my phone:\n\n&gt;CDC WARNS AMERICANS OF 'SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION' FROM CORONAVIRUS\n\nThat was curious. I had never heard the CDC say such a thing before. In the same article was this quote:\n\n&gt;“I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming, and that disruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now,” [CDC head of immunization Nancy] Messonier said. “I had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning, and I told my children that – while I didn’t think they were at risk – right now, we as a family, need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives.”\n\nIt was ominous, but I didn't think about it much. The next weekend, I went to visit my newborn nephew in the NICU at Maine Medical Center. I thought about the coronavirus as I sanitized my hands at the entrance, but nothing else was required of us. \n\nThe next weekend I was in Newburgh, New York for a bachelor party. We hit the breweries and the clubs without a care in the world. I think I read a news story about the virus as we were driving around town in a party bus, but in general it was out of my mind. \n\nBy the middle of the following week, I was sitting on my couch, wearing my biggest down jacket and a knit hat, and shivering despite the fact. My muscles ached. I had a sore throat. When my wife walked in the door, I jokingly held out my hand and said \"Stop. I have coronavirus.\" \n\nOf course, unbeknownst to me at the time, it was not a joke.\n\nI went to urgent care on March 12th, 2020, the very same day that schools were closed and an email arrived announcing that I would be working from home for the foreseeable future. I took a mask from the box in the vestibule and put it on, for the first time in my life. The PA looked at me and sent me home, figuring that because my lungs were uninvolved it probably wasn't COVID. There were no tests back then, but we know better now. Two of the friends I had shared a room with at the bachelor party were sick also. One reported that he couldn't smell his eucalyptus shower gel.\n\nOur brushes with COVID proved uneventful; we recovered and settled into life in lockdown. On my wall calendar, I crossed off the days the way cartoon characters make tally marks on jail-cell walls. In early April, I wrote \"APEX WEEKS\" in red over the weeks of April 13th and 20th. Extrapolating, I wrote \"WEEK OF FALSE HOPES\" in green over the week of May 18th, hoping that events after that date wouldn't have to be cancelled. But I knew it would probably take longer, hence the \"false hopes.\" The reality was beyond my imagination.\n\nInitially, I was supportive of public-health measures. I could see the exponential growth in Massachusetts and New York, and I agreed that something had to be done to arrest it. But as the weeks went by, and millions of people lost their jobs and livelihoods, a sound started to build in my ears. \n\nHave you ever watched a movie, where a plane enters a fatal dive before crashing? You know that sound effect that they use, the one sampled from the [\"Horns of Jericho\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObJV_PITRjA) sirens fitted to Stuka dive-bombers in World War II? That was the sound that started to fill my ears as I searched for news about reopening. The complexities were adding up.\n\n&gt;HEALTH EXPERTS SAY SOCIAL DISTANCING WILL BE IN PLACE FOR 'MONTHS'\n\n&gt;While the data suggest social distancing measures put in place to limit the new coronavirus' spread are working, experts warn that the projections are not an indication that those restrictions should or will be lifted any time soon.\n\n&gt;In fact, relaxing social distancing efforts too soon could lead to a surge of new Covid-19 cases, health experts explain.\n\n\n\n&gt;US NEEDS TO PERFORM MILLIONS OF TESTS EVERY WEEK, EXPERTS SAY\n\n&gt;The United States will have to be able to perform millions of coronavirus tests each week before restrictions can be safely lifted, economists and public health experts say in two different plans for reopening society.\n\n&gt;The two reports differ in their recommendations for just how much testing is needed. One calls for 3 to 30 million tests a week, while the other says the country will need to be doing 20 million tests a day to get a handle on the pandemic.\n\n&gt;While many have called for increases in testing, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said in a Friday press briefing that \"it is beyond the possibility to test everyone in this country every day. \"It's just not possible.\"\n\nMay 18th came and went. Reopening proceeded glacially. And this is where the first cracks emerged between myself and my fellow liberals. *Every business is essential to someone*, I argued. *You can't just crush people's livelihoods and then sit around wishing that the government would provide better support. You either provide the support first, or you let them go out and try to survive.* It was absurd, I argued, that Target and BJ's were allowed to remain open and sell TVs, toys, and patio furniture while their local competitors in those segments were forced to close, just because they didn't also sell food. \n\nI scoured the news obsessively for hints about the end of social distancing and the reopening of businesses. I didn't even care about mask mandates back then. I just wanted people to have their livelihoods back, and for the calendar to have events again. \n\nMy anger didn't really start to burn hot until the end of 2020, when vaccination became the topic of the day. All throughout the latter half of that year, we had been assured that vaccines were the key to dropping restrictions in perpetuity. And when officials started to hem and haw and hedge about the prospect of lifting restrictions, I found myself transported back to an earlier time. \n\nIt was the year 2001, and the news was showing footage of long security lines at an airport on our old CRT TV. The reporter suggested that this would be the case permanently because of the attacks. As a teenager, I cried when I heard that. \n\nThen it was the year 2013. I was driving to work on the 4th of July. NPR was reporting on [tight security](https://www.wbur.org/news/2013/07/04/esplanade-security-crowd) on the Esplanade in Boston. People were refused because they brought umbrellas or plastic silverware. \n\n&gt;While Ayers welcomed tightened security after the marathon bombing, he questioned some of it.\n\n&gt;\"I think they caught the right people already, and we're going to have no problems today,\" Ayers said. \"You still want to be very careful, but I think certainly umbrellas like that were probably OK last year, and now all of a sudden they're not OK. So unfortunately, I'm going to have to run a long distance to get it back to the car.\"\n\nI exploded. I screamed in rage in the car. After all those years of The War On Terror, all those billions of dollars spent and lives lost, people couldn't bring a goddamn can of soda to what was supposed to be a celebration of our freedom. What was it all for, then?\n\nNow it was the year 2020, and it was all happening again. A procession of experts on NPR gloomily prognosticated about how the world was permanently changed. The words \"for the foreseeable future\" were being thrown around a lot. \n\nNot this time. I wasn't going to stand for it. I wasn't going to give up a single thing to the virus. It was the 4th of July on the Esplanade all over again. \n\nThen, there was a ray of hope. Out of the blue, like a bolt of lightning, Rochelle Walensky and Joe Biden stepped up to the podium, removed their masks, and proclaimed that vaccinated people go back to their pre-pandemic lives again.\n\nI was ecstatic. The dark clouds were clearing. In a few weeks, the pandemic had almost completely disappeared from my mind. It was in the past. This subreddit was quiet, except for a few people stopping in to /u/oldgrimalkin's posts to marvel about how far we had come. He announced his intention to discontinue them, as there was nothing more to report...or so it seemed. \n\nThen came the Provincetown outbreak. And the CDC's new county-level transmission scale. And the reimposition of mask mandates in places like Somerville and San Francisco. We were right back into it, and mandates were being reimposed without any exit criteria. Public health officials boldly looked us in the eye and told us that [there was no plan](https://www.sfgate.com/bay-area-politics/article/Bay-Area-mask-mandate-COVID-delta-indoors-when-now-16491615.php):\n\n&gt;\"... What do you recommend that we tell people who are asking, 'At what point do the masks come off?' If we're going to be living with this, as you say, for quite a while, are masks indefinitely in our future?\"\n\n&gt;\"Well, I would say we don't have a set metric. I would say we need to see our hospitals settle down, our cases low and flat, and some stability before we would recommend taking away this very important prevention measure. And the other thing I would say is that even without a requirement, people will continue to mask indoors, it's part of many cultures and may well become part of our culture or at least in some segments as well.\"\n\nI was apoplectic. My rage burned white-hot. We had done it. We were there, in the promised land. And now, here we are, sliding down that slippery slope again. \n\nI won't let it go. This will not be another 9/11, another Marathon bombing, forever stripping us of the ability to do things the we used to do. I will not rest until every single restriction, every tiny COVID-related inconvenience, is eliminated and never to return. In the words of Drake:\n\n*I don't wanna hear about this ever again.*",

One calls for 3 to 30 million tests a week, while the other says the country will need to be doing 20 million tests a day to get a handle on the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While many have called for increases in testing, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said in a Friday press briefing that &amp;quot;it is beyond the possibility to test everyone in this country every day. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just not possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 18th came and went. Reopening proceeded glacially. And this is where the first cracks emerged between myself and my fellow liberals. &lt;em&gt;Every business is essential to someone&lt;/em&gt;, I argued. &lt;em&gt;You can&amp;#39;t just crush people&amp;#39;s livelihoods and then sit around wishing that the government would provide better support. You either provide the support first, or you let them go out and try to survive.&lt;/em&gt; It was absurd, I argued, that Target and BJ&amp;#39;s were allowed to remain open and sell TVs, toys, and patio furniture while their local competitors in those segments were forced to close, just because they didn&amp;#39;t also sell food. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scoured the news obsessively for hints about the end of social distancing and the reopening of businesses. I didn&amp;#39;t even care about mask mandates back then. I just wanted people to have their livelihoods back, and for the calendar to have events again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My anger didn&amp;#39;t really start to burn hot until the end of 2020, when vaccination became the topic of the day. All throughout the latter half of that year, we had been assured that vaccines were the key to dropping restrictions in perpetuity. And when officials started to hem and haw and hedge about the prospect of lifting restrictions, I found myself transported back to an earlier time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the year 2001, and the news was showing footage of long security lines at an airport on our old CRT TV. The reporter suggested that this would be the case permanently because of the attacks. As a teenager, I cried when I heard that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it was the year 2013. I was driving to work on the 4th of July. NPR was reporting on &lt;a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2013/07/04/esplanade-security-crowd\"&gt;tight security&lt;/a&gt; on the Esplanade in Boston. People were refused because they brought umbrellas or plastic silverware. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While Ayers welcomed tightened security after the marathon bombing, he questioned some of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think they caught the right people already, and we&amp;#39;re going to have no problems today,&amp;quot; Ayers said. &amp;quot;You still want to be very careful, but I think certainly umbrellas like that were probably OK last year, and now all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re not OK. So unfortunately, I&amp;#39;m going to have to run a long distance to get it back to the car.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I exploded. I screamed in rage in the car. After all those years of The War On Terror, all those billions of dollars spent and lives lost, people couldn&amp;#39;t bring a goddamn can of soda to what was supposed to be a celebration of our freedom. What was it all for, then?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it was the year 2020, and it was all happening again. A procession of experts on NPR gloomily prognosticated about how the world was permanently changed. The words &amp;quot;for the foreseeable future&amp;quot; were being thrown around a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not this time. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to stand for it. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to give up a single thing to the virus. It was the 4th of July on the Esplanade all over again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, there was a ray of hope. Out of the blue, like a bolt of lightning, Rochelle Walensky and Joe Biden stepped up to the podium, removed their masks, and proclaimed that vaccinated people go back to their pre-pandemic lives again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was ecstatic. The dark clouds were clearing. In a few weeks, the pandemic had almost completely disappeared from my mind. It was in the past. This subreddit was quiet, except for a few people stopping in to &lt;a href=\"/u/oldgrimalkin\"&gt;/u/oldgrimalkin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s posts to marvel about how far we had come. He announced his intention to discontinue them, as there was nothing more to report...or so it seemed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came the Provincetown outbreak. And the CDC&amp;#39;s new county-level transmission scale. And the reimposition of mask mandates in places like Somerville and San Francisco. We were right back into it, and mandates were being reimposed without any exit criteria. Public health officials boldly looked us in the eye and told us that &lt;a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bay-area-politics/article/Bay-Area-mask-mandate-COVID-delta-indoors-when-now-16491615.php\"&gt;there was no plan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... What do you recommend that we tell people who are asking, &amp;#39;At what point do the masks come off?&amp;#39; If we&amp;#39;re going to be living with this, as you say, for quite a while, are masks indefinitely in our future?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, I would say we don&amp;#39;t have a set metric. I would say we need to see our hospitals settle down, our cases low and flat, and some stability before we would recommend taking away this very important prevention measure. And the other thing I would say is that even without a requirement, people will continue to mask indoors, it&amp;#39;s part of many cultures and may well become part of our culture or at least in some segments as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was apoplectic. My rage burned white-hot. We had done it. We were there, in the promised land. And now, here we are, sliding down that slippery slope again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t let it go. This will not be another 9/11, another Marathon bombing, forever stripping us of the ability to do things the we used to do. I will not rest until every single restriction, every tiny COVID-related inconvenience, is eliminated and never to return. In the words of Drake:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wanna hear about this ever again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
