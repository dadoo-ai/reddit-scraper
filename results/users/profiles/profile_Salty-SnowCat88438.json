However, after thinking about it for a couple of days, Shiv had two options:\n\nOption 1: Sell to Lukas and take the money or Option 2: take a risk on Kendall and hope that he doesn't tank the company. Kendall has proved his instability and with some of the actions taken before the vote was done (propping feet up, giving Stewie an exec position), I guess that Shiv started having doubts. I think had Kendall handled the conversation well after she stepped out, he could've become CEO. Instead he freaked out and lied about the death of the kid. Nail in the coffin: either he did kill someone and he is lying or he emotionally manipulated Shiv and Roman. Either is messed up. After that, she knew what she must do.\n\nI can't remember what the exact numbers are, but I know that a majority of the kid's wealth is in RoyStar so her choosing Kendall would not only be just giving him the CEO to do as he pleased, but also exposing her to incredible personal financial risk. Option 1, she gets the buyout money and Tom is an incredibly well paid CEO to boot. So after my initial reaction, I think that if I were in her shoes, I would likely have done the same.",

Which is why I'm here...\n\nPros:\n\n* BAC has definitely been affected by the recent bank crisis and will likely spring back once the end of political theater of the debt ceiling and depositor calm washes over the land.\n* Relatively low IV (again I think, please correct me if I'm wrong) of \\~46 for a LEAPS call expiring in 2025\n* Rates likely to stall/fall in the next few years and very likely to do so before 2025, causing the economy to grow and bank lending to increase\n* Warren Buffet is largest owner of BofA and obviously has phenomenal track record (don't like using this as a pro, but when arguably the greatest investor of all time says he likes the stock, the stock is liked)\n* According to this ([Bank Of America Cash on Hand 2010-2023 | BAC | MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BAC/bank-of-america/cash-on-hand)) BofA has around 1T in cash as of March 31, 2023; likely more than enough to cover any bank runs (and if not the government would likely bail them out anyway or they would get acquired by JPM 😑)\n* Overall solid company with good track record\n* Down about 26% off the 52 week high\n\nCons:\n\n* We are in a turbulent financial situation. If debt ceiling isn't resolved, could lead to some massive hits, especially in the banking sector\n   * Mitigants: It's likely political theater, a LEAPS would likely give ample time for it to bounce back if it's not, sell covered calls during to mitigate any catastrophe in the meantime.\n* Potentially high IV could lead to an IV crush? Not 100% sure so please someone tell me if I'm dumb.\n* High recession risk.\n\nObviously wouldn't want to get it on a day like today where it's popping but wait for a drawback and see what happens.\n\nAgain, I am just some dude being a dude and looking to get into a LEAPS/PMCC...please tell me if this is a logical and well-thought-out plan or a recipe for disaster.",
