If you‚Äôve already started learning or have guidance to be a parent excellent , if not - I believe there are books and videos geared towards dad. \n\nA baby crying is the only way the baby can express themselves if they are not comfortable - it‚Äôs a crazy world for them, they are scared and don‚Äôt know how to ask for food, comfort , etc so the only way that is natural is crying. Constant soothing and familiarizing your smell and your voice can gradually make a baby understand you‚Äôre their parent. The first 3 months - for my spouse was hard as baby wasn‚Äôt comfortable with daddy but now at one year she seeks him out and is always ready for daddy‚Äôs hugs and kisses.\n\nI don‚Äôt think most parents including dads are okay with the crying in the beginning, you bond and start finding ways to soothe baby and this cry becomes an understanding what needs to be done.\n\nYou‚Äôre doing good, Dad!",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a mom who‚Äôs bound to get frustrated with a single cry - what you‚Äôre feeling is normal, we all have been there . You learn and adjust as you go and this first year is a massive learning curve. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as a parent, find a way to understand this. If you‚Äôve already started learning or have guidance to be a parent excellent , if not - I believe there are books and videos geared towards dad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A baby crying is the only way the baby can express themselves if they are not comfortable - it‚Äôs a crazy world for them, they are scared and don‚Äôt know how to ask for food, comfort , etc so the only way that is natural is crying. Constant soothing and familiarizing your smell and your voice can gradually make a baby understand you‚Äôre their parent. The first 3 months - for my spouse was hard as baby wasn‚Äôt comfortable with daddy but now at one year she seeks him out and is always ready for daddy‚Äôs hugs and kisses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think most parents including dads are okay with the crying in the beginning, you bond and start finding ways to soothe baby and this cry becomes an understanding what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôre doing good, Dad!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
