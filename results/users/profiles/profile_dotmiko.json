Upon opening it, I was instantly in love - it's a very sexy product and everything was smooth as butter.\n\nHowever, after using it for 30mins, the keyboard, trackpad, and screen randomly freezes and the wifi fails rendering it unusable until restarted where the issue will persist again after a few minutes of using.\n\nTrying to make things work, I factory reset my new laptop and updated all of the software and drivers immediately upon refresh. Again, it worked for a couple of hours then started becoming a lemon again after a couple of hours.\n\nI reached out to Razer support which are friendly however are super slow in responding. The latest message back was to send them the laptop back so they can diagnose and fix it.

Especially that I'm from Canada and it looks like things are shipped out from/to Singapore.\n\nI saw in their site I can return within 14 days, do I just do this? Would they allow me to just ship it back and have them ship me a new one? I don't want them to take my laptop, take their time diagnosing to get me outside of the 14 day return window, and embarrass myself at work for requesting a gaming branded laptop for work that doesn't even work costing them time and money.\n\nI really wanted to give Razer a shot for their productivity offerings but so far it's just been a disappointment.",

If you’re only starting salesforce and just wants to have a platform to jot down your interactions, you can likely get away with small firms that does quick-starts. \n\nBut the moment you start needing more tailor-fitted work, you’ll likely want to have atleast a part-timer. A fulltime salesforce resource mostly becomes helpful when you can keep them fully busy due to growth or when you’re transitioning from a founder-led sales org to a gtm org :)",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run a consultancy - candidly, you’re too small to be in our ICP but because of that, I can give you an unbiased opinion. I agree with the above. If you’re only starting salesforce and just wants to have a platform to jot down your interactions, you can likely get away with small firms that does quick-starts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the moment you start needing more tailor-fitted work, you’ll likely want to have atleast a part-timer. A fulltime salesforce resource mostly becomes helpful when you can keep them fully busy due to growth or when you’re transitioning from a founder-led sales org to a gtm org :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

(We own our own company but I've always want something for myself)\n\nRecently, I wanted to give myself a try making websites for people or small businesses (being employed to create business systems for my employers gave me a boost of confidence that I could do it). Because its quick, easy and something I'm very familiar with given the field of study that I took up in university, which is both IT and business, mixed.\n\nA month and a half ago, I started www.ampliox.com. Being inexperienced, I thought doing FB ads would bring me customers in a snap of a finger. I was wrong - I got visits, some leads, but no sales. I thought it was a flop so after a week of being determined, I just totally forgot about it.\n\nJust last week, I got bored while playing games and I thought, why not take away the risk-pains of new customers that want to build their websites and offer them 100% free website design, hosting, and SEO for 30 days (and if they like it, they could buy it from me for a cheap price)? Immediately, I started posting some ads at my local sorta-craigstlist (called kijiji.ca) and I received my first two clients that night! I got $400 of profit - spending around 3~4 hours of work per client. I was so surprised that the free 'marketing tool' worked for me.\n\nAfter completing their websites they recommended me to create my own website to give myself some online presence, which really made sense given the nature of the business I'm trying to tackle into. And yes, it's kind of ironic that I didn't do it at first considering that I make SEO-focused websites for them.\n\nNow, I'm cold-contacting small businesses and I'm getting around 10~20 leads a day while still using kijiji. I've got three new clients with one redditor that wanted to set up an e-commerce store (www.manilainabox.com) from an idea that started here by another redditor! I'm not sure if I'll be able to convert these leads to sales, but hey~ fingers crossed!\n\nThis is my second business I've done on my own, the first one made me decent money ($3000 bi-weekly) but I can't do that anymore due to changes in circumstance - so I am rather excited and anxious about my small new little venture.\n\nI'd like to grab some feedback on the website on how it looks. Furthermore, if you guys have some ideas or tips that I should be aware of especially in the custom website design building business, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\n**TDLR;\n\nThe website name is www.ampliox.com. My value proposition is I create, design and host (in my sub-domain) personal or small business websites for free for 30 days with 100% no obligation.
