So we have to pay them to ask AI? Seriously?\n\n3-4 years for a degree cert where it may become redundant? We can achieve the same within 1-2 years now.\n\nDo we really believe the traditional education system can keep sustaining itself in this new era?\n\nThe reality is, upskilling will be the only way to cushion the blow for people in the education industry before AI takes over completely. I believe the world will shift towards skill-based hiring: where you prove your abilities through live tests, not by showing your irrelevant degree.\n\nMost industries and roles will be disrupted by robots and AI. The real question is: how will these people transition to new roles if HRs are always looking for relevant experience.\n\nHR leaders and business owners also need to face another truth: Singapore’s median age is 43 and \\~20% are age 65, getting worse. We’re not a young workforce like Vietnam or Malaysia.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: more and more businesses are looking overseas for cheaper skilled labour. They don’t care about your education: they care if you have the skills to do the job. That means we have to keep upskilling, stay more valuable, and prove we can compete on a global stage with our higher salary demands due to our high cost of living here which puts us in big disadvantage competing.\n\nMost of our professionals and SMEs are still using traditional 90s systems and processes.
