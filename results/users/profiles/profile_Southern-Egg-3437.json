    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time I was there, I&amp;#39;d usually be working on multiple projects at the same time, I&amp;#39;m not sure If this has changed, but usually with smaller shops, you can expect to work on at least two or three projects at a time, and depending on the clients expectations and needs, your hours may vary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WLB and stress levels are pretty standard across any firm. Again, it depends on the client and their needs and expectations. Generally, consulting is a tough place to work in, with burnout and stress being common, given the fast pace and challenging expectations, but with a great shop, you&amp;#39;ll be fortunate to have a good team that backs you up and doesn&amp;#39;t overwork you or set you up to fail. Prolocity did a great job of connecting consultants with projects that align with their skills and domains, and didn&amp;#39;t often put people in stretch projects without added support or guidance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It can be very daunting and mundane at the same time, it’s not the Dreamforce of the good ole days, it’s marketing, business suits, and slow clapping.\n\nThe community events and even local user group events are where it’s at…though many have been struggling to stay active given declining attendance and sponsorships.
