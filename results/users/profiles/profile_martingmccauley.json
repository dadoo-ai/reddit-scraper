    "body": "TLDR parent struggling with ADHD son's academics, and at a loss as to how to support/encourage/motivate\n\nMy 14 year old son is a freshman at a fairly demanding, but very supportive, college preparatory high school.\n\nHe has serious ADHD and has been on medication for almost 5 years now.\n\nI love him deeply and in many ways even bristle at the concept of pathologizing his outgoing, joyful, energetic personality as a \"problem\" to be solved.\n\nThat being said, he has always struggled academically. But, to be clear, he has never struggled with any individual concept in any subject.  Meaning to say, he's bright enough to grasp any concept, but he DEEPLY struggles with staying interested enough in things like the Neolithic Revolution or the differences between the democratic systems in the Roman Empire vs the US, to score well on most quizzes and tests, so his grades hover in the C's, with the occasional low B and high D.  \n\n\nIf he continues to get these grades, there is a chance he will end up on academic probation, and eventually be kicked out of the school.  The school, by the way, is fully aware of his ADHD, and is making all the appropriate accommodations.    \n\n\nIt is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT if not IMPOSSIBLE to find any way of motivating him to put the effort in to get better grades.  We have him working with tutors, and when I study with him, we study in bursts of 15-20 minutes with regular screen time breaks for Snap or Geometry Dash.  \n\n\nEven with all this effort, the material simply does not stick, and he reaches a point where he just stops working.  I get very frustrated, and threaten to take away screen time or time to hang out with friends, but none of that seems to matter.\n\nCan anyone whose parents got it \"right\" chime in on what worked for you.  What motivated you?  What did your parents do that actually felt supportive and encouraging?  Or is this simply one of those areas where there are no easy answers, and we can expect to struggle for the next 3 1/2 years?",

    "body": "Not sure if I’m exactly answering your question, but a very practical thought I have is the concept that suffering is not necessarily what we perceive it to be. There is a natural human response that only sees the apparent tragedy of tremendous suffering. At the very foundation of our faith though is suffering that, on the face of it, seemed shocking and tragic, when it was actually the redemption of the whole human race. \n\nIn many of the writings of the saints, they speak of seeking out suffering, which sounds crazy, but at the same time we don’t normally think that marathon runners are crazy, or bodybuilders, or professional athletes, but, if you really think about it, they all also seek out suffering - suffering in running faster, lifting more, pushing harder - anyone who has ever seriously pursued any of these things, knows that there is serious suffering involved. Well the saints were exactly the same, except they looked for spiritual suffering - obedience to a superior, charity to someone they disliked, loving an enemy.\n\nSo ultimately, to summarize, it’s being open to the concept that our perception of suffering amounts to a profound blindness to suffering as it actually is, and our prayer is not so much “Lord, remove the suffering,” but more “Lord, I want to see!”",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure if I’m exactly answering your question, but a very practical thought I have is the concept that suffering is not necessarily what we perceive it to be. There is a natural human response that only sees the apparent tragedy of tremendous suffering. At the very foundation of our faith though is suffering that, on the face of it, seemed shocking and tragic, when it was actually the redemption of the whole human race. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In many of the writings of the saints, they speak of seeking out suffering, which sounds crazy, but at the same time we don’t normally think that marathon runners are crazy, or bodybuilders, or professional athletes, but, if you really think about it, they all also seek out suffering - suffering in running faster, lifting more, pushing harder - anyone who has ever seriously pursued any of these things, knows that there is serious suffering involved. Well the saints were exactly the same, except they looked for spiritual suffering - obedience to a superior, charity to someone they disliked, loving an enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So ultimately, to summarize, it’s being open to the concept that our perception of suffering amounts to a profound blindness to suffering as it actually is, and our prayer is not so much “Lord, remove the suffering,” but more “Lord, I want to see!”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
