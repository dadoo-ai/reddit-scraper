    "body": "Hi all,\n\nWe just bought a 2024 Volvo XC90 B6, and I wanted to give my feedback. \n\nDetails: \n- Single previous owner\n- 16,000 miles \n- Certified Pre-Owned\n- Middle trim package\n\nThe good:\n- Really pretty car. We got dark blue exterior with blonde interior, and it looks gorgeous.\n- Feels luxurious\n- Good acceleration\n- I like the active lane assist \n- It’s a tank. Definitely feels safe, and the backup auto-brake stopped my wife from backing into a trash can. \n\nThe bad: \n- The technology is extremely finicky. About 25% of the time I try to play music through Bluetooth, the car says music is playing and my iPhone does too… except nothing comes out. Cancel everything/ turn it off - still music will not play until turning car off and on. \n- Twice in the last row weeks, our UI/dashboard just doesn’t work. No sounds from the car, either. Even turning the car off and on doesn’t fix it. So far, only waiting overnight has fixed it. \n- The trunk foot opener seems to only work about 10% of the time. It’s faster to just drop what I’m carrying, use the normal trunk opener, and pick it back up. \n- Start/stop is jerky. Every time I come to a stop for more than 10 seconds or so, the next time I accelerate is extremely jerky. We leap forward; I’m guessing this is due to the gas/electric engine deal it’s got going on\n- Safety features can be annoying. I took it through an automatic car wash, put it in neutral just like you normally do in those, and the car absolutely flipped out, started auto braking and blinking red like it detected an incoming missile. \n\nOverall: 6/10\n\nThis car is very pretty, but also extremely finicky. The tech has me very frustrated. I’m hoping it’s just a learning curve, but a lot of it goes beyond that. For a luxury car, I feel like it should work together better. \n\nI would rather drive my 2016 Camry which just worked. I didn’t have to read a manual to figure out the controls. \n",
