My budget can go as high as 20k if I get good durable dashcam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not really sure about two things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I go for open fitting where cable is plugged in openly. I am worried as it might disconnect with some bumps while driving And also open wire doesn’t look good.\nOn the other hand, if I go for concealed fitting then would it not lose the warranty or insurance. I mostly park my car in open, so I’m also worried about battery life and heating issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen Dashcam where video screen is mounted on rear view camera. What are the pros and cons of the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It was around 8:30 PM there was no street light so I couldn’t see Zomato guy on the bike who suddenly appeared out of no where and trying to overtake my car from the right side . He definitely must have increased his speed to overtake but didn’t realise I am going to take the right turn. In that process his bike leg guard hit my front bumper on the right. He fell on the ground. I stopped the car and naturally my initial reaction was to go check on him if he got any major injury or not. Thankfully he didn’t get hurt much. No blood/bruises. I offer him to take him to my home for any first aid etc. he refused and moved on. When I came back to check on my car I noticed that the front bumper is damaged fully need repairs. Not to mention the many bumps and scratches.\n\nMy question is how could I have handled the situation better. Should I have checked the car first and ask for the damages from him as it was completely his fault? My wife told me o should thank god that nothing serious happened.",
