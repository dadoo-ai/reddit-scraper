Doesn&amp;#39;t ask me about anything related to my life (she used to do it, ask to see me everyday), answers texts hours later instead of right there. I&amp;#39;m thinking of calling this whole thing off but then again when we meet, she is super nice and touchy so I&amp;#39;m really confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you guys think it&amp;#39;s the right decision to call it off or should I try and understand the motives behind the change in behavior first?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: my GF&amp;#39;s behavior changed from day to night after I made an &amp;quot;edgy&amp;quot; joke&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
