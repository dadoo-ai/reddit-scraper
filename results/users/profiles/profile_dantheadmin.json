It’s important to remember that the concept of DevOps can vary from one organization to another. So, a good approach is to engage with your colleagues to gain insight into their daily routines. Note down the key activities they mention and then explore how these tasks are prioritized and executed.

I haven't experienced any gastrointestinal, vomiting, or nausea related issues. The only side effect I've noticed that might be related to the medication is muscle cramps. So, it's important to stay hydrated and consume carbohydrates, as many have suggested. Also, the reduced appetite at 2.5 is real; I've observed a decrease in hunger by up to 50%. This leads to a reduced craving for sweets and overeating. It's not that you will dislike food all the suddenly; rather, your body simply feels fuller, making you less inclined to eat excessively. I’ll report back while on week 2.",
