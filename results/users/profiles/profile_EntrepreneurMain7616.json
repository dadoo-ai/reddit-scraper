There are 2 broad reasons for it,&lt;br/&gt;\n1 - users are not trained enough - they keep asking the similar things again and again,&lt;br/&gt;\n2 - there are systemic issues like conflicting automations&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would advice you to figure out the root cause of the problem. Ofc outsourced devs are a problem but I believe your system needs an audit as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
