I'm improving every day at my job, have made many friends, joined a sports team, and do a lot of traveling on the weekends. About three-four months of me moving last year, my girlfriend of 4 years moved in with me. She kept the same job she had on the other side of the country, but that means she works from our apartment, only interacts with co-workers through instant messaging, and rarely gets out much during work hours. This has hindered her experience out here and has really prohibited her enjoyment of this move. Even when she is not working, she doesn't have the same motivation to go out and explore in the same way as I do. In two months, she'll be moving back home (she's required to stay out here until then).\n\n It's for the best; both for her and for me. The unfortunate part is I feel this whole experience has made me realize I'm falling out of love. We've talked about what may happen in the coming months between us, but we haven't truly addressed the topic of splitting up. I want to make this transition as easy as possible for her because I still deeply care about this person and will do anything I can to make her feel comfortable. For the next two months, what is best for me to do during this time? ",
