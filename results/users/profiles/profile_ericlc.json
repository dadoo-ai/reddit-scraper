I'm looking for advice on Premium Comfort, specifically bulkhead (Row 11) vs. others (Rows 12-15).\n\nSpecifically, I'm a normal height guy that generally prefers more legroom than not; doesn't mind table coming out of the armrest; don't use underseat storage; and prefers more seat width than not. I understand sometimes the bulkhead row has narrower seats, but was unsure whether that was the case on these planes.\n\nIn addition, how much \"risk\" is there in terms of sitting in Row 15, which is in front of the bulkhead for Economy Plus? How frequently are there bassinets in the row behind?\n\nVirtual rendering of the aircraft: [https://xr.klm.com/klm/?type=Boeing&amp;aircraft=787-10](https://xr.klm.com/klm/?type=Boeing&amp;aircraft=787-10)",

Your racquet head speed is very slow but I think it&amp;#39;s how you&amp;#39;re internalizing the timing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One tip from a coach that really helped me understand racquet head speed is how he described &amp;quot;labeling the ball.&amp;quot; I asked, what does it mean to &amp;quot;label&amp;quot;? He meant staying back on the ball as long as you can - getting your unit turn, weight on the back leg, and everything loaded up - and literally waiting long enough to uncoil till you can see the &amp;quot;label&amp;quot; on the ball, so you can really explode into your shot. It&amp;#39;s going to feel weird at first but just think about what the pro&amp;#39;s are doing - they&amp;#39;re taking lots of small steps to get the proper spacing of the ball, racquet prepared early, and then accelerating as quickly as possible into the shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. I&amp;#39;m an NTRP 4.5 / UTR 7.0 for whatever my humble feedback is worth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You'd think that by the way they described it, things were going very well, but the reality is that FINS has fallen short of investor expectations to date. The optimistic investors want to believe that this inflection in HCM+FINS just hasn't happened yet, but will occur in the near future. Do you think there's much veracity to them landing bigger deals in medium enterprise by virtue of HCM+FINS, or is it more like what you've described -- basically \"giving away\" FINS with HCM? \n\nAlso, is there in terms of Generative AI at Workday that would excite you? There had been a lot of fanfare from management about Illuminate at Workday Rising, but I haven't heard much about Illuminate since. More generally, the feedback elsewhere on Reddit seems like there's not much to talk about yet when it comes to the company and Generative AI.",
