The Tempurpedic is just familiar and we like it enough to know we won’t be making a bad decision. The King Coil seems to be comfortable enough, and a has a ton of features we like, but I’ve seen some reviews that complain about durability issues. \n\n Hoping anyone with more knowledge can help me out here, or recommend something outside of those three.

What’s the biggest trades you guys have made?\n\nWell guys after 2 days and about 10 hours of negotiations across multiple time zones I did it. A 4 team trade in a 14-team, IDP league (going into year 3). It was one of the rare trades where each team actually got better. There were also 2 smaller trades I completed sandwiched around this one.\n\nI had a treasure trove of 1sts and 2nds that I accumulated over the first two years and it was time to consolidate assets (for context, non playoff teams in this league have a draft lottery, and the top 3 teams of the consolation bracket get a boost in lotto chances). I was the first team out of the playoffs both years, despite being top 5 in scoring and was ready to make a move.\n\nThe aggregate is I sent out: Stroud, DK, Jacobs, Cook, BRob, Spears, Likely, 3 firsts (none of my own), 4 seconds (2 of my own), 2 thirds (none of my own), 2 4ths and 2 5ths\n\nI received: Alex Highsmith, Micah Parsons, Rashee Rice, Olave, JSN, Breece Hall, ‘26 4th, ‘27 4th, ‘28 3rd.\n\nI have Kyren Williams (complete rams handcuff), drafted Judkins, have the complete Jets handcuff, and Rashee rice for the Olave “handcuff”.  At QB I have Caleb, JJ, and Darnold. LaPorta at TE, and my other IDP pieces are strong (W. Anderson, Campbell, 4 of the top 10 safeties).\n\nThese are the trades and swings that make dynasty so much fun, man. Pumped to have this roster shakeup fall flat 😂",

    "body": "Allen and Mobley played 15mpg together last year (NBA.com, Advanced Lineup Data). Allen played every game Mobley played. Which means Mobley spent roughly 15 minutes playing Center. \n\nWemby and Chet to me are both better shot blockers than Mobley. They’re rangey enough to cover ground and play up the lineup. \n\nClingan, Kessler, Gafford, Bona, Lively, and Huff are all Centers and exclusively play center. And since I’m sure you’re going to argue Kessler also plays the 4, which is barely true, when he and Markennen are both healthy, he plays the 5 (25mpg, again, NBA Advanced Lineup Analytics). So that would mean he played the 4 for roughly 4-5 min a game. \n\nSo by comparison to all of the centers on the list not named Wemby, Mobley plays the 4 a minimum of 3x as much as they do. If we want to break out the math here, the equivalent would be throwing Donovan Clingan at the 4 for 10 mpg (20mpg). \n\nSo sure, “exclusively” was probably a poor word choice, but within the context of this discussion, Mobley’s playing time at the 4 and his schematic responsibilities to step outside of the paint and get on an island (which absolutely none of the above guys are encouraged / coached to do) 100% impact his block opportunities. \n\nI can’t really change your mind regarding you thinking that Huff, Lively, or Gafford are better rim protectors than Mobley. I can at least hear the reason for Kessler considering he’s matched the volume with production and also carries an offensive load. Which again, to the stamina point, is not being considered here. Mobley is a pillar of CLE’s offense. He’s tasked with creating for his teammates and himself more than everyone on the top 10 blocks list outside of Wemby. \n\nAnd for your last point on the foul tax, he averaged 2.0 per game. Less than Kessler, (2.2), Clingan (2.8 in 20mpg), Lively (2.8 in 23mpg), and Hugh (1.2 in 12mpg). Which means not only is he a top 10 shot blocker by non adjusted counting stats, he also more efficiently contests shots with a larger workload without sending the other team to the line. Which, big surprise, is the reason he’s know led the league in contested shots 2 of his 4 years. \n\nThe eye test and numbers both literally backup Mobley being a better shot blocker than 60-70% of this list.",

Just curious if anyone had any thoughts. \n\nAs for what I did: \n\n•Trimmed the fat cap down\n•Used mustard for a binder (personal preference-I like the taste) and covered it with Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning\n•Put it in fat side up on the top rack of my Pit Boss vertical smoker on 225. Hit the stall at 151 around 7 hours. At hour 10 I cranked it to 280 for 2 more hours. Then to 300 for the last hour or so. \n•Pulled it at 197, was probe tender (as far as I could tell lol-went in east as can be)\n•Let us set for about 45 min wrapped in butcher paper. \n\nNo complaints on my end, and everyone loved it. But I’m always looking for tips and tricks since I’ve only had my setup since Father’s Day. Thanks!",
