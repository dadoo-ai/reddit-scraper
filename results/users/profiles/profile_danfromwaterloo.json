So, if you have an epidemic of car accidents, and 2/3 of accidents are caused by 14 year olds - you increase the age of getting your drivers license to like 16. It's just common sense. And, since you already define 21 as an important age (to be able to do something as damaging as drink a beer!) might as well increase that to the age to buy one of these high powered guns. Plus, adding an additional lens on it: 98% of guns used in school shootings are stolen from family members. So, households with children under 21 should not be allowed to purchase these guns. \n\n\\&gt; They'll just buy one illegally!\n\nYeah, but, probably not. The same can be said around the world where these guns are illegal. Yet, you don't see that happen. Canada is the closest comparable. How many school shootings have happened in Canada? 5. Ever. Why? What's the difference between Canada and the US? The media is comparable. Societies are comparable. Canada has strict controls around guns; the US does not.

As we die, our souls get returned to the ocean, and at some point, components of our current soul get reformed into others that get born. I have no basis for why I believe this, or if it's factual, but it makes a lot of sense to me.",

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nWanted to provide a review of my new mattress that I got at the beginning of December from Dozy sleep.\n\nI did a lot of research on this before I dove in - and there was a distinct lack of sufficient reviews IMO, so I wanted to circle back to help fill in the void for anybody considering Dozy.\n\nThe initial rationale for me in selecting Dozy is that I wanted to help support a local mattress firm without sacrificing quality.  Dozy is Toronto-local, and their mattresses are made local - from what I understand, in the same factory as Hamuq, which has more reviews.\n\nSERVICE - 8/10\n\nI placed my order the last day of November, to take advantage of the Black Friday sale, and purchased a King size Richmond model - their top of the line.  I had been watching the prices and $80 off was probably the best sale you're going to get.  Their prices are very competitive normally; the sale was the best of the year.\n\nI placed it online, and received confirmation - easy peazy.  Because I'm not located within Toronto proper, there was a delay in getting the mattress to me as they needed to coordinate delivery times, so the mattress took a few weeks to arrive.  I spoke with Dave, the owner, and he was pleasant and accommodating.  The only ding from the service side was that for the first couple of days after placing the order, I wasn't sure what the status of it was, so I had to call in.  Once done, it was easy there on in.  Delivery guys were nice, took their shoes off when delivering, and wore masks the whole time. \n\nOverall, service was quite good.\n\nMATTRESS - Out of the box - 6/10; broken in - 9/10\n\nFirst thing I did when I unwrapped the mattress was put on a mattress cover, and laid down on it.  It was like a giant mushy brick! I found the top inch of the mattress to be very pleasant, but underneath the mattress was uncomfortably hard.  We tried this for a few nights, and we weren't really happy.  I thought to myself \"maybe we should try taking off the mattress cover to see if that makes a difference\" - and boy did it.  While I know that one should have a mattress cover to protect it from various things, the mattress cover was really hurting the experience of the mattress.  It was a night and day difference.  The mattress was still firm, but it seemed that there was more of a gradation.  \n\nAlso, the mattress transmits very little motion - I don't feel my wife turn over or get out of bed.  My daughter also doesn't wake me up when she crawls into bed with us.  \n\nIn the last two weeks, the mattress has loosened up, and we're really enjoying it now.  Where I used to be a very light sleeper, I'm now waking up from a coma-like hibernation.  \n\nAny complaints I have with the mattress are nitpicky.  The depth of the mattress is deeper than my previous mattress, and the top cover pops off somewhat regularly - which can be annoying.  I also don't know if it's going to sleep hot in the summer - which would be a big drawback for me, but I just don't know yet, and will circle back when I know.\n\nOVERALL\n\nVery happy with the entire experience.  I'm glad I've got a mattress that will do us well for the next decade, I got good service, and I was able to support a local mattress company and small business.\n\nIf anybody has any questions, feel free to reply or DM.",

No attempt for the car to turn over.  All electrical is completely dead.  No odometer or anything.  \n\nSo, my own rudimentary knowledge of cars, combined with the fact that it's literally -40 outside, led me to believe that the battery may have died - funny because I replaced it in the summer.  I called a friend over for a jump, and I was on my merry.\n\nI drove for a half-hour, figuring that the alternator would be able to recharge the battery in that time.  I drove to a plaza near my house, and turned off the car.  Waited about a minute.  Turned the key - nothing.  Great, my battery is still dead.  Then, something dawned on me.  I went in front, unplugged the battery, got in the car, hit the brakes to fully drain the system of electricity, plugged the battery back in.  Boom - car turned over like nothing was the matter.\n\nSo, my question is, what in the world could it be? A short in the electrical system?  Starter? Something else?\n\nI know almost nothing about cars beyond basic triage, and I tried googling with very little help.  When the car started, there was no check engine light or anything that would indicate there was something the matter.  And the lifeless corpse of a car that it was leads me to believe it's an electical issue, but I really have no idea.\n\nHoping one of you can assist. Thanks in advance.",

Fortunately, the axe rolled with good affixes and a socket, so I decided to reroll the \"black damage\" to \"fire damage\" to gain my fire boost.\n\nSo, question to you all:\n\nI currently have two pieces of the \"Demon Set\" - which provides 6000 Fire thorns.  Normally, a pretty bad set.  However, with my fire boosts, it provides a bit of help in large packs.  Now, with the Hack, how does the thorns boost work with my fire boost?\n\nBecause my thorns are \"fire\" damage thorns, I would expect it would get a boost from my 127% fire damage boost, but because there's no published way of calculating this on my own, I don't know if my build will be any good before devoting time to it.\n\nLink to my profile pre-Hack: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/LeroyJenkins-1442/hero/47731064\n\n(I have the Stone of Jordan not equipped right now)",
