They gave her that watch because it would sync easiest with her phone and because she has a known heart arrhythmia (for the notifications and ICE notifications). \n\nShe took the watch on to get it added and connected when she first got it. The corporate store told her that since they didn’t sell her the watch that they couldn’t connect the watch without extra hoops and extra work would have to be done. \n\nShe retired/received the watch on the 29th of February. It’s now 9 May and was admitted to the hospital today because of her arrhythmia. No one was notified until she called my sister from the ER. \n\nIm a bit angry with VZW and the employee at the corporate store. If she had been allowed to Bring her own device (which is a pretty standard thing) we could have taken steps to help my mom before she ended up in the hospital. \n\nfyi: They’re keeping her over night. Mom was a nurse all those years and specialized in geriatric care. We’re pretty confident they will send her home tomorrow. \n\nUpdate:\n\nI’m not saying my mom is in the hospital because of vzw. I get that how I’m the heat of the moment I typed more emotion than fact. I own that. And it comes across that way. \n\nMy mom has a google pixel 8 and a pixel 2 watch. The watch was laser engraved with a message from her work (agree that this is a lame gift after 46 years when I had a job that gave me an Apple Watch as part of its health/wellness initiative). I don’t think they would have engraved a regifted watch, but who knows?\n\nAs a previous poster mentioned, it very well could be that my mom didn’t want to pay the monthly service charge, but $10/mo+ tax wouldn’t hurt her budget at all (she can be miserly, tho). \n\nI’m not sure where the watch was purchased, but my sister works in HR for the same company so she would likely have been part of the transaction (but this puts an awful lot of weight on whether I believe my sister over a network of vzw redditors). What you say about where it was purchased is curious tho. I doubt it was purchased through att or T-Mobile as my mom has the same network as my sister who worked with her. \n\nAdmittedly, I live 7 states away and I would not have been the one to receive the notifications anyway. I posted in emotional frustration. I was not present nor could I have been present during the transaction between my mom and the vzw employee. \n\nWhat some of you have stated is helpful and I genuinely thank you for that. \n\nAgain, I am not blaming vzw for my mother being in the hospital. Vzw has nothing to do with my mother’s heart condition. Any reading of the post that suggests that I’m blaming vzw for my mother’s genetic condition is off-base. \n\nMy issue was the (alleged) behavior of the rep who (allegedly) wouldn’t help my mother.

I’ve caught a few animals, mostly opossum in the live traps, nothing in the foot traps, thankfully- I really only want this bobcat trapped that way and would prefer not to catch it that way. \n\nI’m not sure what else we can set for this cat. I’ve literally been within 30 feet of this bobcat- and it comes out sometimes even mid-day while my kids are playing outside. \n\nAny advice? I do have a 5 foot fence about 20-30 feet inside my property line on both sides of my property and then out the back, my fence is about 1/4 acre from my property line. I’m wooded on three sides with about 6 acres of green space outside of my property.\n\nEdit: fence is 5 feet high, not 4 feet. \n\nAlso, apparently I’m irresponsible for allowing my flock to free range.\n\nUPDATE: Let me be clear - I am not asking for your permission to kill this predator. I am looking for ways to keep my 70 remaining birds alive. \n\nBefore you bitch and moan about that being the problem, we give our eggs away to families in our area who are less fortunate at no cost to ourselves. Often saving them just enough money that they can purchase other necessities. Members in our community who have means donate feed. Members who do not have means receive eggs. It’s as simple as that. \n\nWe don’t sell eggs so we don’t fall under special commercial permits for depredation. However with bobcats, feral hogs, coyotes, mountain Lion, armadillo, and with a host of other animals, there is NO restriction in my state (TX) other than to have a hunting license. \n\nMy first choice is NOT to kill this predator. But losing a significant amount of my flock, has led me to Reddit in hope of finding useful alternatives.\n\nFINAL UPDATE:\nHere’s what we have done. We have added new fencing to create a one acre run. I have put posts throughout the acre and have purchased a significant amount of netting that now covers the entire acre. \n\nOne of the families that receive eggs from us had a LGD give birth to pups so we’re are going to begin introducing the pup to the birds as soon as we take possession. \n\nThank you to everyone who commented ideas, even those who weren’t overly helpful and simply wanted to preach.",

This would embrace our public green space and drive profits through rent, retail leases, and hotel income. The benefits to Bastrop include and expanded downtown, boosted tourism, and more for us locals to do without having to go into Austin. (I’m glad we’re expanding towards cedar creek with everything that’s going on over there, but it’s not driving people into Bastrop as a destination. \n\nI’d spend $20m on affordable workforce housing. Create mid-density, eco-friendly neighborhoods (duplexes, townhomes, small apartments). Energy efficient designs to reduce costs for residents and reduce strain on currently taxed resources. Reserve some spaces for teachers, first responders (fire, ems, police) so we don’t price out Bastrop’s own workforce. Profit comes from residential rents or sales. The benefits to Bastrop is it helps preventing Bastrop from becoming just another growing area that locals can no longer afford to live in. \n\nI’d spend $15m on becoming a tech and innovation hub. Develop a co-working campus with incubator programs for startups (especially eco-tech, agri-tech, and renewable energy). Partner with SpaceX/Boring Company for internships and small-business grants (I know- I’m not a fan of Elon at all, but if he’s here, we may as well use him for something good). The profit comes from office leases, equity stakes in incubated startups. Bastrop gets diversified economy, gives locals career opportunities without leaving town.\n\nI’d spend $10m on Renewable Energy &amp; Water Security Projects. Build a solar &amp; battery microgrid to supply parts of Bastrop (reduces reliance on ERCOT). Fund groundwater recharge initiatives and rainwater harvesting programs. The profit comes from selling any excess energy back into the grid. This helps Bastrop become more resilient in power/water consumption. \n\nI would spend $10m on an arts, culture, &amp; hospitality fund. Restore historic properties into galleries, cafes, or inns. Expand the Bastrop Opera House and support festivals (music, film, food, “Lost Pines Christmas”, anyone?). Profit comes from event venue rentals, hospitality income. This strengthens Bastrop as Texas’ most historic small town, but also may expand to be Texas’ Most Important Small Town because we become a blueprint. \n\nI’d spend $5m on Education &amp; Workforce Development. Fund a trade school / community training center (construction, solar tech, culinary, hospitality). This one has the lowest profit margin, but can be supplemented by partnerships and tuition. This ensures residents actually benefit from all the new jobs we’re creating.",

Build a solar &amp;amp; battery microgrid to supply parts of Bastrop (reduces reliance on ERCOT). Fund groundwater recharge initiatives and rainwater harvesting programs. The profit comes from selling any excess energy back into the grid. This helps Bastrop become more resilient in power/water consumption. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would spend $10m on an arts, culture, &amp;amp; hospitality fund. Restore historic properties into galleries, cafes, or inns. Expand the Bastrop Opera House and support festivals (music, film, food, “Lost Pines Christmas”, anyone?). Profit comes from event venue rentals, hospitality income. This strengthens Bastrop as Texas’ most historic small town, but also may expand to be Texas’ Most Important Small Town because we become a blueprint. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d spend $5m on Education &amp;amp; Workforce Development. Fund a trade school / community training center (construction, solar tech, culinary, hospitality). This one has the lowest profit margin, but can be supplemented by partnerships and tuition. This ensures residents actually benefit from all the new jobs we’re creating.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
