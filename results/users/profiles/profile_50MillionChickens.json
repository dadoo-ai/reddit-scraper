Some tickets say you \"must\" buy reservations, others not, but it's mainly about expected demand. When you buy reservations you are buying them separately from the ticket and in some cases with a 3rd party service. Go ahead and buy them when you know your trips and it is recommended. However depending on the day and the trainline, just know that sometimes all bets are off when you get on a train if there are no reservation lights or train is crowded.

I understand LLP is another level of paper and would require professional accounting. But not sure when it becomes worth taking that step if initial business would be in low 100s annually (USD).   \n\n\n2) Not sure about the timing of registering: if I make the change in January from FTE and just bill as independent consultant until I complete registration for sole trader or LLP.  \n\n\nI'm presently in the US, with expectation of having spouse visa in hand before end of the year, prior to officially going FTE&gt;consultant Jan 1st.  I don't think I have any option.of registering business until I have that visa, unless I have a UK colleague register as main partner and bring me on board post-visa.  \n\n\nHope that covers all the angles here.

FocusonForce was key to prepping with limited time. And particularly the test exams more than the course materials. I just didn't have time to read through all the chapters again, but with test exams you can get really honed on the problem-solving style of these exams, and then review all the Incorrect answers and focus there.\n3.

It seems like the original rule is somehow embedded somewhere else in admin or code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should I be checking next?  I don&amp;#39;t get an actual validation error message, the field just resets to original value if I try to edit and am not logged in as the permitted user.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: SOLVED! :-)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the nudges. So debug showed no errors or specific apex code, but there are multiple related fields involved in this, so I wasn&amp;#39;t looking at all of them for &amp;quot;where is this used?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That done, I found the root cause which was a process builder step implemented by a consultant for the same validation purpose at same time I had implemented the actual validation rule.  Consultant had since left, which added to this temporary mystery. :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But it simply pulls up no hosted files. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ports should be fine as this is not a new setup, clients can see on the old server.

Where would I start to explore this? Do I need a plugin expansion or is it simply a matter of doing API calls by URL?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current system is hosted on FMServer 13. Windows server. I&amp;#39;m tempted to  just walk him back to sql because it&amp;#39;s a known universe for me. Also concerned that even if it&amp;#39;s possible, it pushes more of the API setup over to the Filemaker team. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any tips or references for this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "I have an old upright, circa 1890s. Recently, it suddenly started making very staticy resonant effect on lower keys, like something clearly stuck in the guts or soundboard somewhere. I had piano tuner in and we found one piece of paper up the back, and figured bingo, that's it.  However, I'm now hearing it again and after thorougly clearing any small object from anything behind, here's the real curious part:  the sound changes depending on a few inches in the floor position. I can test this and slide it maybe 3 or 4 inches forward and it's totally clean. Move it back and resonance is back.  It's positioned on old hardwood flooring and there is some movement in the floorboards but not that much.  With the on/off effect of the position, though, I'm more satisfied that there is nothing hidden or stuck actually inside the piano. Correct assumption?  I've everything out except the action, and probed with flashlight, but can't figure out what could be causing this effect based on floor position. \n\nHoping it's something stupidly obvious. Thoughts? :-)",
