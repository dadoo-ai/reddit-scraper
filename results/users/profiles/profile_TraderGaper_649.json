    "body": "Hey, I am a longtime snowboard coach based in North Lake Tahoe. I primarily work out of Northstar and the (FKA) Burton Academy. \n\nI find people do what’s cheap, and convenient, and severely overlook the quality. If you’re spending a significant amount of money to go to any mountain around Tahoe, please also invest in your experience. Yes, you can rent from Tahoe Dave’s and save some dollars, but with the quality of equipment and the lack of knowledge, for setting it up for your success; it is a risk I would not recommend. \n\nI have spent many decades, coaching and training snowboarding across the country. The things I find to be most helpful with any first time or beginner student are:\n1. Research what to expect on the day - weather, cost, time of arrival, time of your lesson, recommended clothing (not jeans), length of your lesson. \n2. Proper rental gear (a snowboard and boots), with proper setup. You could have the right board, but it may not be setup by someone familiar with your body type and experience level. Or they could let you walk out the door without understanding proper boot fit. \n3. Certified Instructors. Some mountains hire just about anyone. However, instructors experience and certification (level 2 or 3) will move you to your goal faster. \n4. Terrain based teaching. The beginner hill for snowboarding is designed to help you learn by using terrain to reinforce the movements. (It’s like bowling with bumpers)\n\nWith all of the above, you will get a high quality of instruction and the patience needed from the moment you step in the “Tent” at Northstar. It’s not going to save you money, but it will save you the unnecessary falls and frustration you would get elsewhere. \n\nHope this helps!\n-James",
