For example, 200-week MA has been strong support for SPY and QQQ going all the way back to 2011 (2020 is an exception).\n\nSo, if we break below 200-week MA and drawdown a lot, that's a huge indicator (albeit lagging) that we are in for some pain in this bear market. On the other hand, we keep bouncing around this 200-week MA and see a strong uptrend for a few weeks, that could be a bullish sign.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are looking for leading indicators, shorter time frame averages might be better, but require a lot of work in making sure that you play the odds properly (for example by setting stop losses). Also, if you are relying on short-term trends, you have to do short-time trades, which require a different mindset and skills to make money.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on what you are trying to get from the indicators. They are usually lagging indicators that confirm specific trends. For example, 200-week MA has been strong support for SPY and QQQ going all the way back to 2011 (2020 is an exception).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if we break below 200-week MA and drawdown a lot, that&amp;#39;s a huge indicator (albeit lagging) that we are in for some pain in this bear market. On the other hand, we keep bouncing around this 200-week MA and see a strong uptrend for a few weeks, that could be a bullish sign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are looking for leading indicators, shorter time frame averages might be better, but require a lot of work in making sure that you play the odds properly (for example by setting stop losses). Also, if you are relying on short-term trends, you have to do short-time trades, which require a different mindset and skills to make money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
