    "body": "I was in a similar position a few years back - I was hired at a large company as an admin right before they decided to change their organization structure so that admins in my office would only handle support/analysts tasks, while all admin and developer work would be based out of our offices in India\n\nI, like you, wanted to expand my skillset and make sure I didn't lose any of my capabilities or become 'rusty' from lack of practice. Like a lot of folks are already saying here, it will be near impossible to get a paying freelance job in this situation unless you have a network and a proven track record of solid work. \n\nIf you're just looking to stay hands on, you can try and build things in your free time. Back then, I would identify an issue in our org, and build out a proof of concept (in my personal sandbox) of how I would fix it. This would accomplish three things - Keeping my skills fresh with hands-on  work, letting my supervisors and department heads know what kind of work I was capable of, and providing a real life example of how I would solve a problem when it came time for me to interview for a job that better matched my career goals.  Think of this as an opportunity to build a portfolio of what kind of work you're capable of producing. \n\nI also volunteered at a very small local charity that needed basic admin work on their 5 person org. Again, I got this opportunity through networking; a friend of a friend familiar with my work at 'big company' connected me. If this type of opportunity is available to you, it's another good way to improve your skills and build a network, but you have to be careful. I was very intentional in selecting projects that I knew I could handle/was skilled enough for. Because I was able to maintain a particular standard of work (and wasn't shy about directing them to more advanced professionals for an integration they wanted done), they became an invaluable partner and reference later on. \n\nI hope this wall of text helps. Good luck on your journey; and at the very least, start building your resume/portfolio with work you're proud of! It'll help you find a better position eventually.",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in a similar position a few years back - I was hired at a large company as an admin right before they decided to change their organization structure so that admins in my office would only handle support/analysts tasks, while all admin and developer work would be based out of our offices in India&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, like you, wanted to expand my skillset and make sure I didn&amp;#39;t lose any of my capabilities or become &amp;#39;rusty&amp;#39; from lack of practice. Like a lot of folks are already saying here, it will be near impossible to get a paying freelance job in this situation unless you have a network and a proven track record of solid work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re just looking to stay hands on, you can try and build things in your free time. Back then, I would identify an issue in our org, and build out a proof of concept (in my personal sandbox) of how I would fix it. This would accomplish three things - Keeping my skills fresh with hands-on  work, letting my supervisors and department heads know what kind of work I was capable of, and providing a real life example of how I would solve a problem when it came time for me to interview for a job that better matched my career goals.  Think of this as an opportunity to build a portfolio of what kind of work you&amp;#39;re capable of producing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also volunteered at a very small local charity that needed basic admin work on their 5 person org. Again, I got this opportunity through networking; a friend of a friend familiar with my work at &amp;#39;big company&amp;#39; connected me. If this type of opportunity is available to you, it&amp;#39;s another good way to improve your skills and build a network, but you have to be careful. I was very intentional in selecting projects that I knew I could handle/was skilled enough for. Because I was able to maintain a particular standard of work (and wasn&amp;#39;t shy about directing them to more advanced professionals for an integration they wanted done), they became an invaluable partner and reference later on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this wall of text helps. Good luck on your journey; and at the very least, start building your resume/portfolio with work you&amp;#39;re proud of! It&amp;#39;ll help you find a better position eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
