    "body": "Hey mate, sorry you had to go through this. Let me share a similar instance in my family. My cousin recently went through a divorce. Our elders tried to reconcile and that worked once. The issue was that the family blamed my aunt for interfering too much, just like you. It eventually ended in a divorce. Now my cousin is sitting at home with a young child who is no longer with his father. I'm sure that's not easy for both parents. So before you consider advice from a divorce group, keep in mind that it won't be easy for you and your child. That girl might suffer mentally, and it might not.\n\nBro, have a chat with your wife directly and try to sort things out. Just drive to her house for a tea, chat with her, show some love (I know it's too difficult to kill ego, but worth trying). Then have a chat with her father and explain the issues. Try to buy time and take her home. Once she's with you, try to listen and sort things out. Never leave your parents stranded in all this process. Now that you've tried everything for your peace of mind, if this still doesn't work out for you, this is the time you should start thinking about extreme measures. But before that, try to work things out for your child. In the long run, this will give you peace of mind, knowing you're not the culprit.\n\nI wish you all the best.",
