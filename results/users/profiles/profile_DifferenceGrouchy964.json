Like others have mentioned, download the inverter company‚Äôs app that will give you the solar production details. When I bought my home, the wifi dongle wasn‚Äôt working and I bought a new one to set it up. Also please check for warranty details. Mine just died and saw the warranty was valid for 5 more months. So the inverter is being replaced by the manufacturer for free (barring installation charges). I started with dodo as my retailer but realised they were giving me very low feed in. Once switched to red energy, last quarter bill was 20 dollars after applying solar feed in and govt rebate. So pretty happy with having solar.",
