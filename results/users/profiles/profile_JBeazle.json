Be warned that the built in keyboard only notices every 3rd letter when typing really slowly. I was really hoping the XPS line gave up on buggy drivers and hardware but i guess not.  If you want hassle free, don’t buy dell’s top of the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least i bought it from costco i guess....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disabling all the dumb intel, realtek, etc. apps that are in the startup tab, doing a full shut down, including disconnecting power and restarting seemed to “fix” it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Windows update and driver updates did NOT fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
