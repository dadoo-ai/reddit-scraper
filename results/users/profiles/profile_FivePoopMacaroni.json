    "communityName": "r/OnePiece",
    "parsedCommunityName": "OnePiece",
    "body": "Just got done with a rewatch of Dressrosa. \n\nFirst time I watched the normal anime, this time I watched One Pace. God One Pace is good.\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* I maintain this is one of the most emotionally fulfilling arcs. The level of depth and the way Dressrosa is centered as a main character really makes me care more than pretty much any other arc about the plight of the people.\n* Doflamingo is probably the best villain in the entire series. He's so fundamentally evil and has such a crazy, lore-filled backstory that he is peak. Top notch. Funny, crazy, easy to hate, truly evil. \n* I love the amazing volume of world-building. The arena presenting so many memorable characters is a great story telling mechanic that let this arc do more to fill out the new world than any other arc. \n* This is the arc where I really feel like the lore solidified into the story we're dealing with to this day. Sabaody introduces it, Marineford really establishes the older generation, Fishman gives us the playing board and the elevated global story of the politics and parties at play, Punk Hazard kicks things off, but Dressrosa is really where it all starts to come together and IMO it's the first arc after all of the pieces are set. It's the payoff of the prior 5-8 arcs (depending on how you count it).\n* God Usopp is peak. His sniper shot and subtle awakening is awesome. It's consistently funny even the 3rd time through.\n* Luffy is a great balance here. Fishman is about showing off the growth so at no point does it feel like the Strawhats are truly in danger. That sort of continues where I feel like even all the way up to Punk Hazard Luffy isn't truly being challenged. Doffy really challenges this new era of Luffy, though I maintain the majority of his effectiveness comes from underhanded tactics rather than raw strength.\n* There is a really satisfying flow to the whole narrative. Like most arcs it culminates with the Strawhats being the unintentional leaders of some massive country-wide movement that is bigger than they ever intended, but this one really involves everyone. Every able bodied adult pushing on the birdcage to buy juuuuust enough time for Luffy to finish Doffy is really inspiring. Using Gatz to announce the final of the showdown is very hype. \n* Damn Doffy is evil as fuck. The Sugar power is easily the most terrifying devil fruit power in all of One Piece. It's just so cruel. Everyone literally living with their loved ones but not being able to remember them is remarkably messed up.\n* Tra-guy's story is exceptional and love to see the level of obsession he made in his revenge. It makes it satisfying to see it culminate and makes me think a lot about how Tra's actions going forward are informed by the scale of the W he got from working with the Strawhats here.\n* There is a lot more subtle lore that hints at the several arcs to come than I remembered.\n* This is the first of a few arcs where they split the Strawhats up, which I think is great. We get a ton of Usopp, Zoro, Franky, Robin here. Big Mom gives us Sanji and Nami. Zou gives more Chopper. It does result in feeling like some of them stagnate a bit in future arcs but I also love seeing them get their time in the spotlight.\n* Bartolomeo is way less annoying than I remember (possibly thanks to One Pace) and I came away loving him more than ever.\n* Senor Pink is peak. One of my favorite fights in the series.\n\n\n**The Less-Good:**\n\n* Oda really adopted the \"show something, then flash back to how it happened\" storytelling mechanic to an extreme that gets a little annoying. It's fine when it's the big stuff like Tra's backstory, but he uses it for very basic moments. Showing a big moment in a fight or something then cutting back to what happened since we last saw them. I found it a bit too much. Feels like 50% of Dressrosa is told in the past tense.\n* One Piece always has a bunch of silly logic that clearly is in service of the broader narrative, so I don't sweat it much. That said, Dressrosa is probably the worst at it. You have all of these world-class warriors in one place, many of them wanting to take on Doffy themselves, yet the \"bird cage\" is so strong not a single one of them can break the strings? Eventually at the end Luffy just Gear 4's his way out of it. It's just such an obviously plot-based power that it sort of requires a mindlessness that is harder to take. Zoro and Fujitora can't cut the STRING? It's completely impervious to EVERYTHING? Zoro is completely undamaged by his fight, and when Luffy is in his arbitrary 10 min cooldown and Doffy is half-dead Zoro couldn't attack him? The animators decided to animate the bird cage in ways where it cuts buildings into 3 but nobody can squeeze through? They have a massive factory that is made of sea stone and can't be cut, but they don't just put all of the people inside that factory? Does Sugar just never sleep? Because the entirety of Doffy's plan sure rests on a single little girl never slipping up. It's just a lot. It doesn't ruin it ultimately, but there are a LOT of moments where I am like, \"Why don't they just do that thing they have established is possible already?\", where the only answer is clearly \"because it would ruin the flow of the story\".\n* I really wish Oda hadn't written the very short arc where Usopp is ready to abandon everyone for a bit. Usopp came back from the two years much stronger but this moment feels like it erases a lot and I maintain he brought back the \"Usopp is a coward\" thing way too hard in general. I don't understand it. God Usopp is amazing but it feels like after all of this Usopp wouldn't be as ready to consider abandoning everyone to save his own life as easily. The lying up until then is great, but the sequence where he is walking away and feeling guilty until he comes back is annoying.\n* I still don't entirely understand the decision to bring back Bellamy but then have him be a simp to a point of forcing Luffy to KO him again. \n* Robin doesn't get much to do.\n* I hate the weird steampunk outfits on the Revolutionary people.\n* Rebecca is hot but also her armor and the fan service is a bit out of control lol\n* I don't love the monarch worship in this series. While the king was clearly framed, they literally get to start the country from scratch and there's always some amazing single leader that everyone follows like a religion. It's true in most arcs, but I never love it. \n* Diamante is forgettable and never intimidating.\n* I don't think I'll ever come around to finding \"The Cavendish joke\" funny and One Piece loooves this joke. Some deluded, vain person who is constantly hearing compliments nobody is saying has never been funny to me and I find it grating. *Side note:* did Cavendish come before Zenitsu in Demon Slayer?\n* The Pica fight is easily Zoro's worst main-battle in any arc IMO. At no point is Pica a genuine threat and mostly Zoro has trouble keeping Pica from hurting other people while chasing walls to slash. Meh.\n\n\n**The Hilarious:**\n\n* Some of the worst powers in one piece. Whatever Lao G's deal is. Corazon's silence fruit. Once-per-hour King punch. \n* So hard boiled!\n* That poor bird Kanjuro draws lmao\n* Sai + Baby 5 marriage\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOverall, still a great arc. I think I liked it more the first time through though and it has dropped 1-2 spots on my \"favorite arcs\" list. It's got a ton to love, especially with having one of the best villains, but it's also maybe too-packed and has some of the most nonsensical writing. Amazing setting, characters and world building, but almost TOO MANY threads (heh) in it.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just got done with a rewatch of Dressrosa. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First time I watched the normal anime, this time I watched One Pace. God One Pace is good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I maintain this is one of the most emotionally fulfilling arcs. The level of depth and the way Dressrosa is centered as a main character really makes me care more than pretty much any other arc about the plight of the people.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Doflamingo is probably the best villain in the entire series. He&amp;#39;s so fundamentally evil and has such a crazy, lore-filled backstory that he is peak. Top notch. Funny, crazy, easy to hate, truly evil. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I love the amazing volume of world-building. The arena presenting so many memorable characters is a great story telling mechanic that let this arc do more to fill out the new world than any other arc. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is the arc where I really feel like the lore solidified into the story we&amp;#39;re dealing with to this day. Sabaody introduces it, Marineford really establishes the older generation, Fishman gives us the playing board and the elevated global story of the politics and parties at play, Punk Hazard kicks things off, but Dressrosa is really where it all starts to come together and IMO it&amp;#39;s the first arc after all of the pieces are set. It&amp;#39;s the payoff of the prior 5-8 arcs (depending on how you count it).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;God Usopp is peak. His sniper shot and subtle awakening is awesome. It&amp;#39;s consistently funny even the 3rd time through.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Luffy is a great balance here. Fishman is about showing off the growth so at no point does it feel like the Strawhats are truly in danger. That sort of continues where I feel like even all the way up to Punk Hazard Luffy isn&amp;#39;t truly being challenged. Doffy really challenges this new era of Luffy, though I maintain the majority of his effectiveness comes from underhanded tactics rather than raw strength.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is a really satisfying flow to the whole narrative. Like most arcs it culminates with the Strawhats being the unintentional leaders of some massive country-wide movement that is bigger than they ever intended, but this one really involves everyone. Every able bodied adult pushing on the birdcage to buy juuuuust enough time for Luffy to finish Doffy is really inspiring. Using Gatz to announce the final of the showdown is very hype. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Damn Doffy is evil as fuck. The Sugar power is easily the most terrifying devil fruit power in all of One Piece. It&amp;#39;s just so cruel. Everyone literally living with their loved ones but not being able to remember them is remarkably messed up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tra-guy&amp;#39;s story is exceptional and love to see the level of obsession he made in his revenge. It makes it satisfying to see it culminate and makes me think a lot about how Tra&amp;#39;s actions going forward are informed by the scale of the W he got from working with the Strawhats here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is a lot more subtle lore that hints at the several arcs to come than I remembered.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is the first of a few arcs where they split the Strawhats up, which I think is great. We get a ton of Usopp, Zoro, Franky, Robin here. Big Mom gives us Sanji and Nami. Zou gives more Chopper. It does result in feeling like some of them stagnate a bit in future arcs but I also love seeing them get their time in the spotlight.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bartolomeo is way less annoying than I remember (possibly thanks to One Pace) and I came away loving him more than ever.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Senor Pink is peak. One of my favorite fights in the series.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Less-Good:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Oda really adopted the &amp;quot;show something, then flash back to how it happened&amp;quot; storytelling mechanic to an extreme that gets a little annoying. It&amp;#39;s fine when it&amp;#39;s the big stuff like Tra&amp;#39;s backstory, but he uses it for very basic moments. Showing a big moment in a fight or something then cutting back to what happened since we last saw them. I found it a bit too much. Feels like 50% of Dressrosa is told in the past tense.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One Piece always has a bunch of silly logic that clearly is in service of the broader narrative, so I don&amp;#39;t sweat it much.

    "body": "I've been sort of divided as I've played. I'm about 60 hours of playtime in to the game. I'm level 37 and have completed the Crimson Fleet/UC quest line, the Rangers quest line, the main Neon quest line, and now the Ryujin Industries quest line.\n\nOverall I'd say I've been enjoying the game about 70% of the time. I have the same complaints as most of this sub. The economy is just indefensibly bad (once you hit level 30 half of the guns you pick up sell for as much as contraband, negating smuggling entirely.. not that any vendor has enough money anyway). I think the Ryujin Industries quest line broke me though.\n\nOverall the missions are fun and stealthy, and I was enjoying the \"horrible corpo espionage\" thing a bunch. Then I got to the end.\n\nSpoiler here:\n\n&gt;!The main final quest has you take on a super hard stealth mission. They load you up with stealth items and encourage you not to kill anyone. I tried for 2+ hours to do it perfectly but ultimately I kept getting screwed by the terrible guard AI who basically just stared guns pointed at vents. Eventually I looked up some guides and found out there's basically no punishment for shooting your way out and I got frustrated and gave up.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Then I went back and I was presented with a light scolding but otherwise pushed on to the final board meeting where I was pushed to decide who to back for CEO and whether or not to back their product launch plans. By then I sort of didn't care. The first person made me do a bunch of messed up stuff on behalf of the company, much of which put actual lives at risk. Then Ularu betrayed them and looped me into a plot to take on the CEO. So I betrayed both of the first people and backed the existing CEO since they're all cold business ghouls anyway. Then it ends and the CEO says Ularu gets to keep her job anyway. So I looked up another guide to see what the impact was because I definitely didn't care enough to do all of that again and apparently it literally doesn't matter at all. One of them ends up CEO, but either way you get an office and access to mission boards and the exact same rewards. It's literally all meaningless.!&lt;\n\nThen this is what sort of killed me.\n\nDespite me having ZERO companions with me the whole time, they all magically know everything and I returned to my ship to be scolded for not stopping the product line or some shit. The companion system is just moronic. They all follow you around and pester you with sound bites constantly and not only do they judge you for your actions, they judge you for actions they couldn't possibly know about. If you just don't talk to them for a long time then they all get backlogged and the next time you talk to them you have this whiplash of \"I can't believe you did X\", \"Oh you're awesome for doing Y and I love you\", \"Oh god you're a monster for doing Z\". It just kills any kind of immersion and frankly makes me not want them around at all.\n\nFor example, with the Crimson Fleet:\n\n&gt;!I chose to side with the pirates because the UC literally threatened me and forced me to go on suicide missions and ignored their own \"laws\". So ultimately they directly wronged me more and I figured their anarchy was better than the fake-good fascism of the UC. Then my crew scolded the hell out of me for basically enabling rampant murder, with zero dialog options for me arguing about how bad the UC was to me. Then of course they all just shrugged anyway and it didn't impact me at all. Heck Sarah didn't even break up with me over it. She was awfully mad but then had no problem just going back to being lovey-dovey 2 seconds later.!&lt;\n\nUltimately it's the same sort of cowardly writing from Fallout 4. Your decisions mean nothing and barely affect the world. The only one I have found satisfying-ish so far is the Crimson Fleet stuff which has a genuine impact on where you can go and how the world reacts. Beyond that, I wish the game were a lot smaller and higher quality across the board.

I&amp;#39;m level 37 and have completed the Crimson Fleet/UC quest line, the Rangers quest line, the main Neon quest line, and now the Ryujin Industries quest line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;ve been enjoying the game about 70% of the time. I have the same complaints as most of this sub. The economy is just indefensibly bad (once you hit level 30 half of the guns you pick up sell for as much as contraband, negating smuggling entirely.. not that any vendor has enough money anyway). I think the Ryujin Industries quest line broke me though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall the missions are fun and stealthy, and I was enjoying the &amp;quot;horrible corpo espionage&amp;quot; thing a bunch. Then I got to the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spoiler here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;The main final quest has you take on a super hard stealth mission. They load you up with stealth items and encourage you not to kill anyone. I tried for 2+ hours to do it perfectly but ultimately I kept getting screwed by the terrible guard AI who basically just stared guns pointed at vents. Eventually I looked up some guides and found out there&amp;#39;s basically no punishment for shooting your way out and I got frustrated and gave up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Then I went back and I was presented with a light scolding but otherwise pushed on to the final board meeting where I was pushed to decide who to back for CEO and whether or not to back their product launch plans. By then I sort of didn&amp;#39;t care. The first person made me do a bunch of messed up stuff on behalf of the company, much of which put actual lives at risk. Then Ularu betrayed them and looped me into a plot to take on the CEO. So I betrayed both of the first people and backed the existing CEO since they&amp;#39;re all cold business ghouls anyway. Then it ends and the CEO says Ularu gets to keep her job anyway. So I looked up another guide to see what the impact was because I definitely didn&amp;#39;t care enough to do all of that again and apparently it literally doesn&amp;#39;t matter at all. One of them ends up CEO, but either way you get an office and access to mission boards and the exact same rewards. It&amp;#39;s literally all meaningless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then this is what sort of killed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite me having ZERO companions with me the whole time, they all magically know everything and I returned to my ship to be scolded for not stopping the product line or some shit. The companion system is just moronic. They all follow you around and pester you with sound bites constantly and not only do they judge you for your actions, they judge you for actions they couldn&amp;#39;t possibly know about. If you just don&amp;#39;t talk to them for a long time then they all get backlogged and the next time you talk to them you have this whiplash of &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe you did X&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Oh you&amp;#39;re awesome for doing Y and I love you&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Oh god you&amp;#39;re a monster for doing Z&amp;quot;. It just kills any kind of immersion and frankly makes me not want them around at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, with the Crimson Fleet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;I chose to side with the pirates because the UC literally threatened me and forced me to go on suicide missions and ignored their own &amp;quot;laws&amp;quot;. So ultimately they directly wronged me more and I figured their anarchy was better than the fake-good fascism of the UC. Then my crew scolded the hell out of me for basically enabling rampant murder, with zero dialog options for me arguing about how bad the UC was to me. Then of course they all just shrugged anyway and it didn&amp;#39;t impact me at all. Heck Sarah didn&amp;#39;t even break up with me over it. She was awfully mad but then had no problem just going back to being lovey-dovey 2 seconds later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it&amp;#39;s the same sort of cowardly writing from Fallout 4. Your decisions mean nothing and barely affect the world. The only one I have found satisfying-ish so far is the Crimson Fleet stuff which has a genuine impact on where you can go and how the world reacts. Beyond that, I wish the game were a lot smaller and higher quality across the board. Ultimately it&amp;#39;s still a shadowy mimic of The Outer Worlds because it just refuses to do anything that might restrict player access to content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It gets justified because anyone can be trained to construct a big mac meal in 10 mins, but you can't train people to have rapport and access to powerful people. Executive work sucks ass, and I think it's reasonable to pay people who have spent decades building and refining their ability to influence and direct others more, primarily due to scarcity.

Their hours are polluted with meetings and corpo bullshit, and doing it well makes it blur into social time to a point where everything is viewed through the lens of work.
