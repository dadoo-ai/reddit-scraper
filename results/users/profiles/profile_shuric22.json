So always coaching and upleveling your team to become great SCs.     \n- you are leading programs which positively impact the territory - enablement, reusable sales plays, product/vertical specialization, etc. Strategic initiatives that uplift the whole territory.     \n- leading by example - you are co-owning large deals with your SCs, leaning in to do whatever you can to bring largest deals in your territory across the line, building relationships with customers.",
