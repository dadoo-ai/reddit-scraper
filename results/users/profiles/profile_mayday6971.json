    "body": "So I bought a new lock, and it is nice and it is hidden inside of the door. The manufacturer said the lock has to be 10-15 feet away with unrestricted sight from the HomeHub. The master of my whole setup is an AppleTV 4k in my family room. I cannot move the AppleTV since it is wall-mounted and connected to the TV in the family room. The door this lock is on is 18 feet straight line from the AppleTV to the lock.\n\nSo the question. If I buy a HomePod mini and put it close to the lock, will this help the situation? I get a lot of \"lock not responding\" in the Home app and the lock isn't very useful. The manufacturer said it is only a 3-month warranty even though it says it has a 2-year warranty (ugh to that too).\n\nSide question, has anyone else noticed that you need to do a lot of resetting of some of these accessories? I had to remove and re-add a different lock brand and re-add it to HomeKit and it is working again (August WiFi). \n\nAll my wife really wants is so she doesn't have to carry her keys when she goes running and for the lock to reliably open and lock when she wants it to.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I bought a new lock, and it is nice and it is hidden inside of the door. The manufacturer said the lock has to be 10-15 feet away with unrestricted sight from the HomeHub. The master of my whole setup is an AppleTV 4k in my family room. I cannot move the AppleTV since it is wall-mounted and connected to the TV in the family room. The door this lock is on is 18 feet straight line from the AppleTV to the lock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the question. If I buy a HomePod mini and put it close to the lock, will this help the situation? I get a lot of &amp;quot;lock not responding&amp;quot; in the Home app and the lock isn&amp;#39;t very useful. The manufacturer said it is only a 3-month warranty even though it says it has a 2-year warranty (ugh to that too).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side question, has anyone else noticed that you need to do a lot of resetting of some of these accessories?

The two new boxes are XG1v4 / AX014ANC boxes. I will be replacing the DVR and one of the set-top boxes on the two 4K televisions.\n\nBackground: So my setup now is the 2year old DVR and 2 of the small set-top repeaters. The DVR is the PX013ANC model. The two repeaters are PXD01ANI models. These are all working perfectly in the home with the current wiring. There is an internet router as well (my own Netgear). The line runs into the house and has a MoCA Gateway Passive IPGH3M4-VF.

As I said, everything works today with the old equipment. it is not working with the new equipment. I tried calling technical support and they said a technician will have to come out at $100, which defeats the purpose of the $15 self-install kit. \n\nAnyone can help on this?",
