    "body": "Hi all, happy November! Anyway, I have a question that I need to be pointed in the right direction for, but otherwise I think I should be fine. \n\nSo I need to update our pricing, which is going to become more complex. Essentially, Depending on the volume of licenses, pricing changes for each tier, but not retroactively.\n\nAs a simplified example, if you buy 300 licenses:\n\nSeats 1-100 are $100 each       100\\*100 = $10,000  \nSeats 101-200 are $75 each     100\\*75 = $7,500  \nSeats 201-300 are $50 each.    100\\*50 = $5,000\n\n300 Seats are $22,500. Average seat price is $75.\n\nOur actual situation has way more tiers, and to somewhat future proof this, I want it to be easily adjustable. My thought was to put all these calculations on the Object record, so I can pull from those fields for my calculations, rather than ever have to manually adjust pricing all over the place.\n\nQuestion is… these custom fields would have to go on the Product record? Or is there a better way to do this? We don’t offer many products, just 3 for the foreseeable future. Thanks!",
