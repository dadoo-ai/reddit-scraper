I have had sensors rip off from catching my backpack wrong or something. Today is a first. \n\nFirst sensor? Slides right off when I put my sweater back on, even with the overpatch in place. \n\nSecond sensor? I apply immediately after using the normal procedure but with extra alcohol prep on a scrubby pad. Now, 7 hours later, I take a shower. Normally, this would be totally fine. I avoid the area. I get out of the shower. Sensor is dangling.\n\nThird sensor? I insert it, and it just immediately fails.
