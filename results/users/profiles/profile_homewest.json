Nothing I&amp;#39;m reading about SB-43 would require the county to take them off the streets. It requires a petitioner to first ask the county to get involved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the website I found to be most helpful: &lt;a href=\"https://www.disabilityrightsca.org/publications/sb-43-and-care-court-community-faq\"&gt;https://www.disabilityrightsca.org/publications/sb-43-and-care-court-community-faq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can file a petition under CARE Court?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A CARE Act petition starts the court-ordered response. The petition can be filed by:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some family members including spouse, child, parent, sibling, or grandparent&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Roommates&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;First responders who have had repeated interactions with respondent, including police, EMTs, paramedic, firefighter, or mobile crisis response worker&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The director of the county behavioral health agency where respondent resides&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The director of the county adult protective services where respondent resides&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The director of a public or nonprofit organization providing the person behavioral health services&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hospital director of the hospital where the person is hospitalized&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Behavioral health provider who has supervised treatment or provided the individual treatment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The public guardian or public conservator of the county in which the respondent is present or reasonably believed to be present&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The director of a California Indian health services program or California tribal behavioral health department&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The judge of a tribal court that is located in California&lt;a href=\"https://www.disabilityrightsca.org/publications/sb-43-and-care-court-community-faq#footnote8_3jkm748\"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You and Terra Lawson-Reemer do not count as petitioners. I am curious if there&amp;#39;s someone you can call at SDPD or SDFD to see if a file has been created on this person and if CARE court is an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Based on the layout of our home, we don’t think it will be comfortable in another couple years. \n\nOption 1\nSell our current home and buy a new home. We would cash in on the equity we’ve created. Most traditional option. We would add to my wife’s commute (I work from home). Unfortunately, it would be a big cost for a moderate increase of space. \n\nOption 2\nTry to keep our current and buy a bigger home. I mapped it out and we could potentially make this work. We almost have the down for a bigger home in a cheaper neighborhood. Rent in our area would be about even with our mortgage+taxes. Things would be tight for about 10 years. After that, the house is paid off and we would be generating ~$5k a month. I would be in my late 40s. It just feels daunting to commit to a high earning/high pressure job for that long. I have a thought about coast fire or getting a different “passion” job before that time. \n\nOption 3\nWe renovate our current home to accommodate our needs (more bedrooms and a bigger kitchen). It would cost roughly the same amount as a down payment for a bigger house ($200-$300k). Homes around here go for $700-$1000k a sq foot. Building would cost $300-$500 a sq foot. We get to keep our 2.5% interest rate. We also don’t add to our debt with another expensive mortgage. The cons are dealing with a complicated construction project and moving out for 12-15 months. Rent around is nuts.\n\n\nAnyone else running into this? Anyone else renovate to keep their low interest rate?",

    "body": "I have been contributed to my traditional IRA for the last several years (5-7 years). I have multiple people tell me I am doing it wrong, but I only fully understood the implications today. \n\nMy IRA is a \"rollover\" IRA, but functions as a traditional IRA. I have been contributing with after tax dollars. Today I learned, I should have been filling out a form on my tax returns saying that I have been making these contributions. I file using TurboTax and from what I can tell, I did not make it known that I have been funding my IRA in this way. I understand that if I do nothing, I will also be taxed when I withdraw money years from now. In other words, I believe the account is tax deferred, but not tax exempt and I will have paid taxes twice. \n\nIs there anything I should/can do about this now? Will the cost to correct it (hiring a tax attorney) cost more than the potential benefit down-the-line?\n\nAdditional Info:\n\n\\- The rollover IRA has about $60,000\n\n\\- I also have a 401k. Moving forward, I'll likely fund an after-tax option of the 401k with an in-plan conversion and stop funding the IRA altogether\n\n\\- My wife and I make too much to contribute to a roth\n\n\\- I am in my 30s",

I agree, grandpa, there were clear differences between our educational experiences. \n\nI appreciate the lesson on converting organic matter into fossil fuels. You're right–on a grand scale the stored energy for both these processes came from the sun! That's a great observation. \n\nOne clear difference I see in the two processes is the time it takes to convert sunlight into stored energy. The process of sun&gt;solar panel&gt;battery is pretty fast. We're talking about the speed of electrons. \n\nIn the process you're advocating, it's going to take awhile to convert plants into fossil fuels–like millions of years difference.\n\nWhy don't we try this. You go collect a bunch of leaves and put them in a bucket, wait for it to become fossil fuels, then burn those fossil fuels in a combustion engine, use that to power an alternator and then use the electricity to power your house. \n\nIn the meantime, the rest of the world is going to move forward with storing energy from the sun in other ways, like sodium, lithium, hydro-dam, hydrogen etc etc.",

    "body": "**Context**: I have been on this sub for about two hours and I'm absorbing all the resources that I can. I am starting with S&amp;S and just completed my swings. I watched the Turkish get-up video multiple times and I wasn't able to recall all the steps on the floor (for example, I passed the weight to my opposite arm when rolling over. I didn't know which leg to stand up on). I didn't want to watch the video while doing the workout because of the pace and direction of my eyes.\n\nSo, I watched the video again and broke down the steps in a way that felt intuitive to me. This isn't meant to be comprehensive explanation for the entire exercise. Rather, it is meant to be a way to recall the movements with special callouts.  I am hoping that breaking it into 7 steps will help me remember the full movement. Since I have it written up already, I thought I'd share with other folks who are new like me or struggling with the complexity of this exercise.\n\nGiven that I've been on this sub for a limited time, feel free to provide suggestions or edits. As mentioned, I'm trying to find a balance between a quick reference with tips without it being too much to read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Start on side** \\- Lean towards the side of the lifting arm. If pressing with the right arm, start curled over on the right side. It is ok to use two hands to lift the bell into position.\n* **Roll to press position** \\- As you roll onto your back, bend at the lifting side elbow and then use both hands to lift the bell into position. The opposite arm continues onward and eventually resting at an angle. The lifting side leg is bent and the opposite side is extended. If pressing with the right arm, the right leg is bent, the left leg is extended and the left arm is extended at 45 degrees\n* **Roll to elbow** \\- Pressing arm extends upward until opposite elbow is at 90 degrees (shoulder does not need to be 90 degrees)\n* Post to hand - continue pushing upward until the opposite arm is fully extended.\n* **Low sweep** \\- The opposite leg bends and comes under the lifting-side leg. Finish on the knee of the opposite leg.\n* **Come up** \\- continue pushing up until the opposite arm is full off the ground and back is perpendicular to the floor.\n* **Windshield wipe** \\- The opposite leg was at an angle after the sweep. Move the opposite leg to square up the hips. The finishing position looks like the classic lunge (aside from the arms).\n* **Stand** \\- You got this!\n\n(Reverse Reverse)\n\n* Lunge to knee\n* Windshield-wiper - opposite leg moves to an angle\n* Hinge toward opposite side\n* Post - opposite side arm is placed on the ground at an angle\n* Low sweep\n* Come to elbow\n* Lower to back\n* Roll to starting position - grab weight with both hands at the top",
