What I‚Äôve learned with this game - being newer myself - is that the mistakes help you learn what not to do. You probably settled in a place that either has low production initially, or low food so it takes awhile for your city to grow. Your citizen work tiles so if your 1st city has 4-5 people, they‚Äôre working tiles that yield high food/production. Your 2nd city may only have 1-2 people so the production is going to be lower. However, even though something like a campus might take 50 turns in your second city, that number will go down once your population grows. You‚Äôll learn through gameplay + forums + YouTube how to balance food and production and what are the best settles. Have fun and know that it will come to you. \n\nOne thing to note, the game autosaves the last 10 turns, and you can manage this in the settings. As you‚Äôre learning, if you make a mistake, you can load a past save file and try something else.",

All I can tell is that it takes a lot of gameplay and trial and error to really get that vision.

And that mountains are good for campuses, natural wonders and mountains are good for holy, gov plaza is good for commercial, dams/aqueduct are good for industrial, and entertainment and wonders you build are good for theater. So those are some guardrails I work with. But I‚Äôm not good so I rarely get my second or 3rd city bonuses from stuff I‚Äôve built in my first city.",

    "body": "To give you a non-answer, my biggest struggle is how to order things efficiently. I always have a bunch of cities, money, production, etc., after turn, say, 250. But what I‚Äôm not efficient at is when to build and why. For example, I like to wait until I get Ancestral Hall to crank out settlers so they‚Äôre cheaper and come with a builder. I don‚Äôt like to produce too many builders until I get extra charges (Pyramids/Feudalism). I‚Äôm always looking to maximize production but sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm just getting by and then take off. I have found that early war is helpful because capturing cites can ‚Äúcost less‚Äù than settlers in some situations. The conquered city already has things built by the time I take it. On standard speed, my games feel like survival for the first 100 or so turns (barbs, civs, resources), then I really start cooking, and then I coast to the W. But that first 100 or so turns always feels like I‚Äôm doing something incorrectly or out of order. I‚Äôm newer and have watched a couple videos, but I just don‚Äôt think I have the hours needed to have the instincts on where my focus should be.",
