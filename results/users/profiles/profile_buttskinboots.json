Problems I have are having basically no appetite and am therefore underweight, and my sleep sucks because I stopped taking my other anti anxiety stuff.\n\nIt sounds like a good match, but, holy shit.  I had an insanely vivid dream for the first time in years.  It was like the season finale of 6 different HBO tv series at once.  So many themes.  Violence, sexuality, trust, drug use, romance, etc.  \n\nThat was pretty cool tbh.  I remember most of it.\n\nUnfortunately, the dream ended by me falling to my death.  If I didn’t have the tv on like I always do I feel like it would have gone on.  I was able to hear the speaking through the dream and snapped myself out of it.\n\nThis is bad… right?  I haven’t had suicidal ideation in maybe a decade.  I just don’t know if it’s worth starting this drug and not being able to stop it.  \n\nIs it worth it in your opinion?  I don’t really trust psychiatrists these days so I would rather hear from patients.\n\nThanks!",

Idk im just ranting because this shit sucks yo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: I’m trying to get to all the comments I can.  I appreciate people’s thoughts on this.\nSo far the themes have been that I should have communicated with her on that one day, or that she had other plans.  I guess I learned a valuable lesson either way!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further update because I think some people are confused.  Thursday we made plans and set the date for the coming Saturday. The next day was Black Friday and I didn’t message her because I was busy.  Then Saturday comes around and I ask her about our plans tonight and she said she made other plans.  It was one day of noncommunication.  It wasn’t like a week or something.  If it was a week or even a few days without communication I would agree that it’s an issue.  But it was one day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I want to stress that it was just kind of joking vibe stuff because that was the way I talked with my friends.\n\nAnyways I forget about it and the woman I got broken up with changes her mind.  We hang out a bunch and things were going really well.  Until she started acting distant and I was kind of upset because I thought it was going well.  Turns out she went through my phone and saw that conversation with my friend from that night.  Keep in mind this was months later so that was the only thing she found that was a problem going back that far.  We basically broke up and that was it.

I had a few dates lined up for the weekend and the following week and I was super nervous, but very excited too.  I really like getting to know people and I feel like meeting in person seems to go well a lot of the time.  \n\nAnyways, on Saturday I had a date planned to have drinks and dinner at my house.  An hour before, they stopped responding and unmatched.  There were no signs of awkwardness or anything dumb that I said at some point.\n\nThen later on Saturday night, another person I was talking to about music, and how similar of tastes we had in it, just stopped responding. \n\nThen on Sunday, I was with my parents having dinner and someone I was talking to said let's hangout right now.  I said I couldn't at the moment but I'd love to set something up this week, because I had plans the day after.. and radio silence followed.\n\nMonday I had plans to go to a bar/arcade with someone and they had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances  and then when asked if they had time later in the week, they stopped replying.\n\nThe point of this is that this happened again twice yesterday.  I understand ghosting is a thing that happens with online dating and dating apps, but I am sort of confused about this.  I don't know if I'm just absolute shit at texting or if this is just something that happens to everyone, or maybe I am just getting unlucky.\n\nMy request for advice would be, for people in a similar situation, is it worth it to continue doing dating apps at all?  \nI don't meet very many women so dating apps allow me to meet many new people, but it seems to sort of end badly and with demoralization because things fall through.  I feel like I am charming enough in person, but it seems to never get to that point.  How can I better attract people to want to stick to plans made, or at least can anyone relate to this?   \n\nIt's embarrassing and feels awkward to ask, but my access to good advice is kind of limited in my personal life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to anyone who responds.",
