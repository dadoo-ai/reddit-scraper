    "body": "Currently a clinic manager of an Outpatient Patient Clinic. Been doing some looking inward on how to better perform as a clinic. \n\nA little background, we are a clinic of 2 PTs with 2 aides and a few front office staff that are stellar at their jobs. We just built a pool with the anticipation of treating aquatics and bringing on a 3rd PT. We are expecting that as elective surgeries begin to ramp up we will see an increase in overall referrals. Additionally, most of the PT clinics in the area have sadly shut their doors in the wake of COVID. \n\nA small comment on PT clinics in general. I have only been in the field a couple years as a DPT but have been around the field in other capacities as an aide/observer for over 8ish years. In my time around PT I've felt that habits and clinic tasks tend to settle. Their doesn't seem to be too much innovation and change in the way we run a practice on the clinic front outside of tx. I feel that I've seen many family own practices hit a barrier when trying to expand simply because in terms of business and operations PTs tend to be lacking. We went through schooling to become excellent clinicians not business men. \n\nI want my staff and myself to be prepared for the increase in patient volume. \n\nMy questions is, for those of you that have found ways, what are some ways in which you improved your overall operations as a clinic? This can include electronic completion of outcome measures, emailing intake paperwork prior to evaluations to improve arrival rates, etc...\n\nI know this is an open question and is more of a brainstorming exercise, but I strongly want to see our field improve and feel that settling with how we've always done business may keep us where we are at in the outpatient setting.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently a clinic manager of an Outpatient Patient Clinic. Been doing some looking inward on how to better perform as a clinic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little background, we are a clinic of 2 PTs with 2 aides and a few front office staff that are stellar at their jobs. We just built a pool with the anticipation of treating aquatics and bringing on a 3rd PT. We are expecting that as elective surgeries begin to ramp up we will see an increase in overall referrals. Additionally, most of the PT clinics in the area have sadly shut their doors in the wake of COVID. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A small comment on PT clinics in general. I have only been in the field a couple years as a DPT but have been around the field in other capacities as an aide/observer for over 8ish years. In my time around PT I&amp;#39;ve felt that habits and clinic tasks tend to settle. Their doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be too much innovation and change in the way we run a practice on the clinic front outside of tx. I feel that I&amp;#39;ve seen many family own practices hit a barrier when trying to expand simply because in terms of business and operations PTs tend to be lacking. We went through schooling to become excellent clinicians not business men. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want my staff and myself to be prepared for the increase in patient volume. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My questions is, for those of you that have found ways, what are some ways in which you improved your overall operations as a clinic? This can include electronic completion of outcome measures, emailing intake paperwork prior to evaluations to improve arrival rates, etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is an open question and is more of a brainstorming exercise, but I strongly want to see our field improve and feel that settling with how we&amp;#39;ve always done business may keep us where we are at in the outpatient setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
