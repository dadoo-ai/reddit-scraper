Would we be fine getting there early and getting open chairs? Or is it worth it to spend $325+ tax on a day bed? Just 2 of us. This is our first time so we don&amp;#39;t know anything about the Vegas pool scene or Cosmo pool scene. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "Just got back from Cancun and thought I'd post some helpful tips/comments/thoughts. Long post but wanted to be thorough \n\n-We flew from NYC/JFK direct this past Sunday morning. Cancun airport arrivals side was quiet and quick and easy. We flew Delta both ways. We used USA Transfers for our pickups/dropoff both ways. Super easy and highly recommend. \n\n-We stayed at Le Blanc.  By far the most amazing resort iv ever stayed it. 5stars, adults only, all inclusive. It is not somewhere you go to party. You go to relax, get amazing customer service, and sit by the pool and beach. We are 25 year old males and I would say the average age was more in the 35 range but we didnt mind. We got upgraded for free to a partial ocean view room and it was an amazing view. The whole resort for phenomenal. And the resort is also owned by Palace Resorts, you get access to other resorts I'm Cancun for free. We visited Beach Palace [dirty and loud and just sucked overall dont bother] and Isla Mujeres Palace [nice and relaxing and quiet]. Le Blanc is 10min walk from downtown nightlife if you want to party. We did 2 nights down there. Le Blanc also has their own \"lounge/nightclub\" that does a DJ sometimes and live band others. We saw the band and it was fun.\n\n- Covid-testing: We opted to do covid testing outside of the resorts free offering because I had covid last month and didn't want to risk getting a positive result even though I am healthy [CDC says you can test positive 90 days after]. I didnt want to run the chance of testing positive at the resort and then the resort knowing and quarantining me. There is like 3-4 places downtown you can get covid tests. Ahorro Pharmacies is one, but we did Analisis Clinicos del Dr. Simi. Which is one of the approved on the embassies list. Was quick and easy and I think it was $35ish. Got results emailed to us in 3hrs. \nThen when we were flying out we just had the files on our phones and uploaded them to Deltas software at the airport. The software automatically verifies and then you get a \"green screen\" with a QR code and show that to the Delta employee and you are all set.\n\n-Departing Cancun was definitely busy but nothing crazy. The only long part was checking in/dropping our bags. The Delta line was about an hour. After that, security was fast. Definitely alot of people in the terminal eating/waiting for their flights. But also was spring break. There was no craziness or confusion like other people have wrote here. Just a normal busy airport. Definitely get there at least 2 hrs before hand maybe more\n\n-The locals and especially resort staff take covid seriously. Every worker at the resort was always wearing a face mask covering nose and mouth 24/7. I never saw anyone even pull it down to scratch their nose. Le Blanc followed all protocols, limiting capacity in restaurants and everytime you went somewhere to eat they offered hand sanitizer before. Every time. Everywhere. I couldnt recommend this resort more. The food was phenomenal. The lunch and breakfast buffet was crazy amazing and so many options. You also have a butler on every floor and they have a \"texting service\" so if you want to schedule a dinner reservation or ask for more water or anything really, you just text them. They also have a free spa service called Hydrotherapy.  Too long to type it out but look it up its amazing. We did it twice. \n\nAll on all, it was an amazing week. Covid testing added a tiny bit of s anxiety but totally worth it was for the trip overall. We also did 2 day trips to Isla Mujeres and Rio Secreto. Cancun is safe, beautiful and amazing and I cant wait to go back.",
