Could this potentially leave a ring of scratches around the actual edges of the lens? I squish the headset on my face really tight so I can exercise with it and sometimes bump the lenses lol. I looked at multiple magnetic lens attachments and they all have to click in before you can use the magnetic attachments as a removable piece.\n\n2. I think I’m noticing more bloom with these Plano lenses. Is that normal? I looked at many threads and I think some bloom is normal. Is there an example image someone can share if normal bloom? \n\n3. All 180 and 360 videos look pretty crappy. I tried DeoVR and the girlfriend one is probably the best free example of what’s possible,  a little blurry still, but much better than everything else. Where can I find SFW immersive vids to share with family? People say to download the vids to improve quality but there isn’t an option to? What website are you guys using if not DeoVR to show off cool vids?\n\n4. Using YouTube VR using the default quest browser, everything is way more zoomed in than YouTube VR app, making the quality way worse. Ppl say it’s better this way what am I doing wrong?\n\n5.

This is my first non apple laptop and I heard gaming laptops are more likely (fingers crossed will never need it) to need repairs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there an included manufacture warranty at no additional cost? If the laptop is flawless for 2 years with no additional cost I’m willing to risk not buying a warranty… or should I? How much are they?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Could barely hear cars. Visited at night to double check and walked around the neighborhood for a while. It’s a very light hum and less noise than I’ve had living in DTLA. This is a non-issue for me and wife. I’ve read studies that this isn’t great, but it’s quieter than we’ve had it.\n\n- The house is next to a curved on-ramp (the furthest point from the curve) that heads on to a freeway. I would guesstimate 250-500m from on ramp, 1000m from the freeway. Studies show the houses linked directly to freeway (like freeway, wall, your house, like in DTLA) can lead to higher levels of stress / health issues. This house has many trees blocking the on-ramp, large wall, large backyard, then house. I can’t see the on ramp/lights at all even at night\n\n- I’ve heard being next to freeway results in soot etc clogging your air vents and getting cars/house windows dirty every few days. I’ve checked the house, area, and everything looks clean. Friend that lives two blocks inward in the same area said his is all good (but i heard every block matters). \n\nOf the articles and vids I’ve looked at, i suppose they are referring to those houses directly adjacent to the freeway or even as the houses’ wall as the separation so it’s almost directly part of the freeway.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I’ve been looking for about 2 years, and this is the second house where there’s little compromise (0 compromise until I started researching freeway articles). The first one was during the peak of the housing market and I was outbid by a lot. There was a line to see this one but the agent believes we have a good chance as a lot of people have been falling through and the owners want to sell to a young couple.",

That’s why I’m asking if I can at least file something to call out or get uninsured/tagless douchebags on file. \n\nI’ve learned that this is common occurrence and no one cares, BUT my question is if I can do absolutely anything about the unregistered and uninsured douchebags?\n\nStory:\nThe owner of the car actually refused to speak to me and his friend (in a separate car) did the talking saying he saw no scratches and refused to let me talk to his friend or give identifying information. I called insurance and basically it goes against my deductible unless I get his insurance. I spoke w the police department and they said as it’s minor my best bet is to get an estimate from my insurance and file against him at the DMV just to get points on his record. Basically he gets away w this all the time (his bumper is filled with dings and different colored paints).\n\nAlso his friends car is unregistered (paper plate), but I’ve seen his car in this area for months (double parks near my work place every day).\n\nIs there anywhere I can file something even if not to cover my paint damage but to at least file that they are unregistered and uninsured drivers?",
