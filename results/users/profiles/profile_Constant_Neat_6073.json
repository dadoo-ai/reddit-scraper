    "body": "Hiya folks, \n\nI figure I’d ask the brilliant minds of Reddit for advice.\n\nLike most of ya’ll I want to grow my income. Unfortunately, that requires me to make a career change. I’ve decided to pursue a career in tech and consult in my current field as a secondary means of income. Accomplishing this will surely triple my income if all goes well.\n\nThat said….I’m hoping that you all can offer some recommendations for me in regards to entry level MS SWE (development/information security) programs. I do not have a tech background but hold a few degrees (all GPAs over 3.5). My BS-10yrs, MS-5 and 6 yrs. My fingers are crossed in hopes that learning will not be a problem….. Funding it on the other hand…. Well….I DO NOT want to take out any student loans for this additional degree. I could pay for a few classes here and there but I want to complete it as fast as I can. I’d like to make the transition within the next 3 years. \n\nSo my questions to you all are:\n\n1. Would you seek a degree or certificate? \n\nMy thinking is that if I want to be able to maneuver my way up in the field the degree is more beneficial. Yes, I could go back to school but I don’t want to unless I HAVE TOO. \n\nOh yeah,  I am open to work based trainings as well.\n\n2. What other areas do you all predict major growth in the next 5-10yrs? \n\nI’m also considering a potential concentration in AI. Someone has to manage and/or repair the AI machines if they are to take over, right? Then there is the chance that I will veer into cybersecurity. \n\n3. Can you please share any funding/scholarship tips you used while attaining your degree(s), certifications, etc.? I’m a woman and a minority so if that helps you identify more specific funding opportunities great. Google can only help so much. Sifting through all of the sponsored ads to get to the “good stuff” is becoming a headache. \n\nDespite my mind being all over the place I do know that I am sold on making the change. It is just a matter of WHEN the transition will start and how it will be maintained or rather paid for without me coming out of pocket too much.\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance.",

    "body": "First replace the missing brick veneer. I like exposed brick but you can get bored of it after a while so perhaps painting it will make you like it again. But remember there is no turning back once it is painted. Add some backsplash….glass or mother of pearl mosaic are always nice to look at. Metal ones are good too. Add some under cabinet lighting and a valance on the window. You could also take the tile up the area around the window to create separation of the window and wall. I’d consider having a permanent island installed or you can paint/vinyl wrap the one you have to change the vibe of the room.",

So move it forward and perhaps get a slimmer coffee table. I’d then flip the desk and bar areas. You can use the current bar you have add some shelving and lights or go all out and new build cabinetry. Also paint that area (the nook and/or adjacent wall) a different color than the rest of the room. Here Repositioning the bar will allow you to use the adjacent wall and the nook to store more of those items out in the open. The newly designated office area could be set up similarly to how you have it now…only difference is that it is now by the windows.",
