Never use process builder for new features. There’s pretty much no need to do this as record save flows will run way faster especially for record updates. Now that sub flows are included you should be able to scale them to fit complex scenarios.\n\n2. Handle new conditional validations with dynamic forms. Validation rules take significant time to execute and if you only need to enforce them to end users you are fine handling most conditional requirements through dynamic forms. A good 80% of validation rules I see are “if field A is ___ then require field B”.\n\n3. Ditch after triggers for change event triggers. Waiting for DML statements takes a huge amount of time if you check your logs. Ditch them and use change data capture to handle related record updates if possible.\n\nThat’s pretty much it. If you follow these rules you’ll be pretty happy with performance!",

It makes sense, and I'm glad SF is trying to enforce best business practices in addition to best technical practices.\n2. Data Architecture - Reporting is an important topic here, like report performance affected by skinny tables and other factors.\n3. Data Architecture - Archiving was a tough one for me. I'm surprised Salesforce doesn't have more native archiving solutions. They even recommend using third party tools like OwnBackup. While it's a great product, this + the issues last month highlight that this is a gap for smaller customers on the platform.\n4. Sharing and Visibility - I was shocked at how many questions I received on programmatic sharing and development concepts in general. There was a large number of questions about Visualforce pages and security, which seems a little out-of-date to me. Salesforce probably needs to do a serious update on their questions to accommodate new dev concepts like LWC and Aura Components.\n5.
