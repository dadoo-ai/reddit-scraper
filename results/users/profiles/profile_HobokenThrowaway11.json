    "body": "Unfortunately what you actually saw was a lazy/not equipped account team and specifically an SE that didn’t take the time to customize the out of the box Agentforce Service Agent demo to their customer.  Worse yet they didn’t vocalize properly that this was a base level demo component that barely glosses over the capabilities representative of what ASA should be able to ship with agentforce 2.0 with ready to go topics, actions, and flows ready to go and capable of reusing your previously built flows to create new custom actions for your agent with almost always minimal adjustment. \n\nSet-up time is truly less than 30 minutes for these OOTB use cases but just like anything customization to your business is going to take time to build the topics and actions and tie them to the flows you want for your business.\n\nNow here is where I show value on these every day.\n\nStep 1: show the spin up of a net new ASA. It truly is \nSuper fast\n\nstep 2: Highlight topics and talk through what they are and how they are created. I even like to change mine on the fly to add an easily recognizable instruction so when I show the topic being called we understand that the instruction modification worked. Example: “when a customer asks to cancel an appointment always tell them ‘Please don’t do that’ “\n\nStep 3: show actions and how they tie to prompts or flow or apex code or whatever else. Then either build an action or augment an existing action.\n\nStep 4: show how it works /live demo highlight the topics and action we built and then diving into the power of the generative ai couple with data cloud, Rag, and atlas\n\n\nWhat you don’t see behind the scenes and something they skipped completely is tying the agent to external data using data cloud  to leverage RAG capabilities  and the atlas reasoning engine.  This is where the magic starts happening.

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately what you actually saw was a lazy/not equipped account team and specifically an SE that didn’t take the time to customize the out of the box Agentforce Service Agent demo to their customer.  Worse yet they didn’t vocalize properly that this was a base level demo component that barely glosses over the capabilities representative of what ASA should be able to ship with agentforce 2.0 with ready to go topics, actions, and flows ready to go and capable of reusing your previously built flows to create new custom actions for your agent with almost always minimal adjustment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set-up time is truly less than 30 minutes for these OOTB use cases but just like anything customization to your business is going to take time to build the topics and actions and tie them to the flows you want for your business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here is where I show value on these every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: show the spin up of a net new ASA. It truly is \nSuper fast&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;step 2: Highlight topics and talk through what they are and how they are created. I even like to change mine on the fly to add an easily recognizable instruction so when I show the topic being called we understand that the instruction modification worked. Example: “when a customer asks to cancel an appointment always tell them ‘Please don’t do that’ “&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: show actions and how they tie to prompts or flow or apex code or whatever else. Then either build an action or augment an existing action.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4: show how it works /live demo highlight the topics and action we built and then diving into the power of the generative ai couple with data cloud, Rag, and atlas&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you don’t see behind the scenes and something they skipped completely is tying the agent to external data using data cloud  to leverage RAG capabilities  and the atlas reasoning engine.
