He‚Äôs not the one‚Äù \n\nI always had this fear that when we are engaged we would break up because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not into him any more‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done‚Äù or ‚ÄúI decided this isn‚Äôt for me. You‚Äôre not for me.‚Äù \n\nWe‚Äôve noticed a pattern, anytime his therapy is interrupted (his therapist stopped) he gets back into his old behaviors more often (condescending tone, or reactant).

    "body": "Hey everyone‚Ä¶. So for years I‚Äôve been calling my boyfriend - fianc√© , because we knew we were getting married, and I wanted to do exposure therapy to help me adjust to the idea. \n\nI‚Äôm glad we did! Anyhow- we are going to Japan next week and my mom *accidentally*  slipped about getting engaged. üò¨\n\nI‚Äôm really glad she messed up because I‚Äôd rather prepare emotionally a head of time. \n\nAnyhow, I‚Äôm actually reacting better compared to my first engagement at 21. They fell through bad (ex husband). I was panicking and crushed emotionally .. death. Felt too rushed. \n\nThis time, I just feel ‚Ä¶ acceptance ? But also a bit sad‚Ä¶ ngl‚Ä¶. Just grieving my time being single and not married‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm so scared my relationships out side of my SO are going to change. Meaning, I fear that because I‚Äôm married now (well , we are eloping) that I won‚Äôt be treated seriously or prioritized in my sport. \nMy fianc√© is super supportive. \n\nFor reference, I‚Äôve been with my coach for 10 years. He‚Äôs seen me go through it all. Back in 2020 when I was in the abusive relationship , he said something that shifted my perspective and really affected me: \n\nI was having a bad day and he could tell. He asked me what‚Äôs going on. I said, ‚ÄúI just want to focus on (sport)‚Äù ‚Ä¶. Well he stares at me and says: \n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt.‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhat you mean?‚Äù \n\nResponse: \n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt. You‚Äôre working , you‚Äôre in school, and you‚Äôre married.‚Äù ‚Äî I was crushed. That made being married even harder. My brain immediately associated ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù -&gt; with ‚Äútoo late; can‚Äôt be an athlete and seriously pursue it.‚Äù \n\nWell I opened up to my friend who also trains with my coach (5 years later)She sympathized with me . I said I don‚Äôt hold it against him because I sincerely don‚Äôt think he meant any harm. But it really affected me and it‚Äôs going to make my next engagement harder. I fear losing coaches support or belief in me all because I‚Äôm just signing a paper‚Äù . She assured me it be a good idea to have a conversation with him to clear the air, and she believes he didn‚Äôt mean any harm and said ‚ÄúI think he also thought you know since you were married you wanted to focus on your husband.‚Äù He even believed in me then, but my ocd brain marked ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a contender anymore because I‚Äôm married.‚Äù \n\nSo I‚Äôve been reassuring seeking like crazy! Looking up athletes who are married and still train and taken seriously. \n\nSo yeah, she recommended to have a conversation with him about it , because it still in my mind years later and I don‚Äôt think (coach) knows that his comment was took and how it effected you.‚Äù \n\nSo yeah. I‚Äôm irrationally fearing I‚Äôll lose my coaches approval, or belief system in me. I fear because I‚Äôll have the title of marriage that means he can‚Äôt treat me seriously anymore. I do well when I‚Äôm treated seriously. He knows my boyfriend (fianc√©) and how much I love him. \n\nI‚Äôm just scared. I know this is silly. \n\nI feel like once I clear the air with my coach, engagement will be more manageable. It‚Äôs like the uncertainty of being an athlete in my sport and married. \n\nI don‚Äôt have to wear the ring when I‚Äôm doing my sport. I‚Äôm relieved. My fianc√© is happy because he doesn‚Äôt want it damaged , neither do I. However my OCD has me thinking if I don‚Äôt wear the ring üíç that means I don‚Äôt love him, I‚Äôm looking for way out, etc., \n\nI will say, I feel 90% acceptance (something I never felt before) and the other 10% is sadness. \n\nSadness I‚Äôll be leaving my apartment (living in my own) ü•≤. Sadness that all other options are officially cut off. \n\nPlease I‚Äôm getting engaged in Japan which is amazing but I‚Äôm just so scared. What if I resent my fianc√© for taking away my single life identity???? And it‚Äôs ruined . ",

    "body": "Small win! Want to share . I posted originally on the OG Neville subreddit, however, my post takes forever to even be approved. \n\nHey everybody! I am writing to share my small internal win. \n\nSo I‚Äôm working on something *great* ! You‚Äôll see me post about it in the future (üòâ). \n\nAnyhow, I‚Äôm an athlete. I‚Äôm an adult. And yes, the world I‚Äôm in many people only ever view children and teenagers as potential success. \nIt‚Äôs sad, and honestly‚Ä¶ kind of *weird* the obsession. I always viewed athletes who were in the elite world in their teens and pre-teens as ‚Äúwell no duh they can do it. Their bodies are young and weightless just like they said‚Ä¶.‚Äù \nAs the whole world is so impressed. Quite frankly , I know this can sound maybe rude ‚Ä¶ but I wasn‚Äôt impressed , because it‚Äôs expected when that young. I believe it‚Äôs impressive what we can do with our bodies if we have the belief system and resources. \n\nAnyhow, I thankfully have one of the top coaches here in my region, that believes in me and pushes to break the limiting beliefs in the sport.\n\n For years I‚Äôd be waiting ‚Äúnot until I have xyz consistent‚Ä¶, then I‚Äôll compete‚Ä¶ then I‚Äôll call myself an athlete.‚Äù \n\nDoing a lot of inner work and meditation I realized this was a huge wall actually holding me back. I was *waiting* for it to come to me. Rather, I changed the story. I said, ‚Äúyou know what. I‚Äôm not waiting anymore.‚Äù \n\nI decided to join a different countries team and plan to compete next year! I made a social media account and put myself out there. I get  a follow from a top coach in Korea. I notice the work they do and I really love it. I reached out to them for lessons and they were willing to coordinate . Well‚Ä¶. Few months later I had this YEARNING ‚Ä¶ THIS CALLING to just GO TO KOREA AND YOU WONT REGRET SOMETHING GREAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN IF NOT RIGHT AWAY. \n\nSo, I listened to it. Feeling nervous but at like peace ? ‚ÄúPeace beyond understanding‚Äù (Philippians 4:7) is what I felt. So I booked my flight and airbnb to Korea. I made arrangements to train in Korea with the Korea national team coaches for 1 month. Holy Hannah I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat am I doing ?!?!‚Äù I would *never do this* a year ago. Even 6 months ago I would say, ‚ÄúI have to wait till I have this skill then I can go‚Äù ‚Äî by saying that, I‚Äôm telling myself I‚Äôm not worthy of my desire, hence the 3D will reflect that. But I did this in courage and faith, of uncertainty . I leave this week. I know I‚Äôm worthy of my dream and desires. \n\nThen, I met a guy while doing some vendor shows. We started talking about Korea and he asked me why. I told him how I‚Äôm training there for a month because I‚Äôm an athlete. He was impressed and excited! He then asked if ‚Äúwhat are you training for the Olympics ?‚Äù \n‚ÄúYes. Actually.‚Äù \n\nNow‚Ä¶.. this is something I would neverrrrrrr say. I would always say ‚Äúwell yeah I‚Äôm training to compete. I have to go through tests first.‚Äù ‚Äî I would do this for years, to try to justify to myself that I‚Äôm not that good as people think I am. Looking back‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt fully believe or accept my desire to be mine‚Ä¶ to be worthy of it. Now I do! So I said ‚Äúyes :)‚Äù when he asked me. \n\nHe asked me how old I am. ‚Äú27.‚Äù , being nervous at his reply I just waited in uncertainty of ‚Äúwill I look foolish?‚Äù \n\nHe says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre 27 and training for the Olympics ?!? GTFO! ‚Äú and was SO EXCITED. He asked for my picture. \n\nHe thought it was so impressive to see a 27 year old go for that. We then ran into each other the following week and he was excited to see me. He told me he was raving all about me to his nieces. \n\nOK the final: \n\nSo the other day while I was at practice, I approached a coach to ask her a question. When I approached her, her energy was kind of weird. I asked , ‚Äúcan you coach moves ?‚Äù And she said yeah blah blah. I explain how I‚Äôm doing a different countries test requirements and if she could help me understand it and go through with it with me. She ask more questions how I need to talk to that federation to see what tests are transferable. Ok‚Äî she didn‚Äôt seem to understand or listen what I was saying because that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm doing lol. \n\nAnyhow - I ask how much she charges and she tells me her rate. She proceeds to ask, ‚Äúmind asking how old are you?‚Äù I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 27.‚Äù \nAnd she ask ‚Äúwhat last level you left off at ?‚Äù \nMe: I state my level. She does ‚Äúoh! Okay so level 3 is equivalent to adult silver..(something) we will do that then!‚Äù \n\nAs soon as she said that, in my body and head i immediately HARD PASSED with her as a coach. I finally recognized we were not aligned with my intentions. She immediately placed me in the adult category (basically test easier for adults) when my head coach back home wants me in the standard (didn‚Äôt mention that to her). \nShe didn‚Äôt seem interested anyways, she didn‚Äôt even give her phone number. Rather, she seemed annoyed I even asked. \n\nI‚Äôm so proud of myself because a year ago, if I encountered that interaction, I would of practiced with lack and doubt overwhelming me, and then I‚Äôd have a sucky practice and cry and get frustrated lol. Well, that changed . Instead I practiced away as if I already won. I‚Äôm the champion. I said ‚Äúher loss, my gain.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt take it personally for once. Rather, I just vetted out a person who will not help me get to my goal and is not aligned with my intentions. \nI had the best practice! Even if I did something wrong bc I‚Äôm still learning, I *finally* didn‚Äôt care of panic. I accepted it‚Äôs part of the process to frustration. \n\nI wanted to share this because to me , these are all very big wins internally. A year  ago I‚Äôd be taken over by doubt and resistance, a lot of old stories. \n\nWhen I made that decision in the moment to write her off.. it felt so empowering.. to trust myself. In that very moment I had two opportunities:\n\nGo with story A) believe that she is right and that I am worthy to just go on the basic route that really isn‚Äôt my desire but it‚Äôs where I deserve to belong according to their perspectives\n\nOr \n\nB) reject her idea. Keep pursing the actions towards my new story and desire. \n\nSee I had a little fear of when I rejected her ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm being delusional and she‚Äôs right. The universe will keep me pushing that direction till I‚Äôm there.‚Äù\n\nI let that thought pass.. acknowledging it. Then I went, ‚Äúhuh! I actually just told God my self worth. I know I‚Äôm worthy of my desire to go standard and I can do the bigger things. So I will continue to choose to align myself with the intentions and that is what I *just did*\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nUPDATE: \n\nSo my great paying job was at threat lmao! After balling my eyes out and releasing my fears‚Ä¶ I had an inner knowing it‚Äôs all taken care of. Usually I‚Äôd skip training the next day if something like this happened. However, all I did was keep affirming I am an Olympian, I‚Äôm worthy. I AM! I choose to come to training this AM, because that‚Äôs what an Olympian does. Even tho for a moment I felt unworthy and was doubting. I affirmed even if I do lose my job, it will work out in favor for my dream. It‚Äôs working for me not against me.\n\nMeanwhile I read on the skating subreddit how adults cannot learn triples because they are past puberty and they have hips so it‚Äôs more resistance. It just never made sense to me why a person who trained triples pre-puberty can keep them all bc they have the ‚Äúmuscle memory‚Äù when they get hips‚Ä¶. Doesn‚Äôt add up. They said it‚Äôs harder to learn with hips. I actually laughed. I affirmed for me it was EASY. I AM. I AM CREATED FOR THIS! It doesn‚Äôt have to be hard‚Ä¶..I am worthy, I am capable. I AM A CHAMPION \n\nSo this AM on commute to training I kept affirming I AM A FAST powerful jumper. I rotate so fast. I AM A FAST TRIPLE JUMPER! \n\nWell during practice I was doing the usual warm up of my jump rotations. My coach stopped and said ‚Äúwoah that was way too fast. That was a glitch.‚Äù (We do it virtually). He had me do it 4x to make sure! He affirmed that indeed it was NOT a glitch and speed up‚Ä¶ that indeed it was ME!!!!! AMEN! \nI kept saying I Am! \n\nIt also felt SO EASY! Just as I was affirming in the car. I for once finally came conscious of my foot going down and crossing as it should for once in my life. Just like I said in the car! \n\nWe moved on to triple rotation , and although I‚Äôm still learning - I already am it! He was also impressed how fast my rotation was and we had really good session for training triple jumps. They keep gettting better and better.\n\nI AM!!!!! \n\nWhen everything seems to work against you, feel the doubt, but don‚Äôt feed it. Show your doubt the other path, which is one of creation. Doubt can always choose your density if you allow it, YOU can always create if you fuel it. \n",

He then asked if ‚Äúwhat are you training for the Olympics ?‚Äù \n‚ÄúYes. Actually.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now‚Ä¶.. this is something I would neverrrrrrr say. I would always say ‚Äúwell yeah I‚Äôm training to compete. I have to go through tests first.‚Äù ‚Äî I would do this for years, to try to justify to myself that I‚Äôm not that good as people think I am. Looking back‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt fully believe or accept my desire to be mine‚Ä¶ to be worthy of it. Now I do! So I said ‚Äúyes :)‚Äù when he asked me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He asked me how old I am. ‚Äú27.‚Äù , being nervous at his reply I just waited in uncertainty of ‚Äúwill I look foolish?‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre 27 and training for the Olympics ?!? GTFO! ‚Äú and was SO EXCITED. He asked for my picture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He thought it was so impressive to see a 27 year old go for that. We then ran into each other the following week and he was excited to see me. He told me he was raving all about me to his nieces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK the final: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the other day while I was at practice, I approached a coach to ask her a question. When I approached her, her energy was kind of weird. I asked , ‚Äúcan you coach moves ?‚Äù And she said yeah blah blah. I explain how I‚Äôm doing a different countries test requirements and if she could help me understand it and go through with it with me. She ask more questions how I need to talk to that federation to see what tests are transferable. Ok‚Äî she didn‚Äôt seem to understand or listen what I was saying because that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm doing lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow - I ask how much she charges and she tells me her rate. She proceeds to ask, ‚Äúmind asking how old are you?‚Äù I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 27.‚Äù \nAnd she ask ‚Äúwhat last level you left off at ?‚Äù \nMe: I state my level. She does ‚Äúoh! Okay so level 3 is equivalent to adult silver..(something) we will do that then!‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as she said that, in my body and head i immediately HARD PASSED with her as a coach. I finally recognized we were not aligned with my intentions. She immediately placed me in the adult category (basically test easier for adults) when my head coach back home wants me in the standard (didn‚Äôt mention that to her). \nShe didn‚Äôt seem interested anyways, she didn‚Äôt even give her phone number. Rather, she seemed annoyed I even asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so proud of myself because a year ago, if I encountered that interaction, I would of practiced with lack and doubt overwhelming me, and then I‚Äôd have a sucky practice and cry and get frustrated lol. Well, that changed . Instead I practiced away as if I already won. I‚Äôm the champion. I said ‚Äúher loss, my gain.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt take it personally for once. Rather, I just vetted out a person who will not help me get to my goal and is not aligned with my intentions. \nI had the best practice! Even if I did something wrong bc I‚Äôm still learning, I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; didn‚Äôt care of panic. I accepted it‚Äôs part of the process to frustration. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share this because to me , these are all very big wins internally. A year  ago I‚Äôd be taken over by doubt and resistance, a lot of old stories. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I made that decision in the moment to write her off.. it felt so empowering.. to trust myself. In that very moment I had two opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go with story A) believe that she is right and that I am worthy to just go on the basic route that really isn‚Äôt my desire but it‚Äôs where I deserve to belong according to their perspectives&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) reject her idea. Keep pursing the actions towards my new story and desire. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See I had a little fear of when I rejected her ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm being delusional and she‚Äôs right. The universe will keep me pushing that direction till I‚Äôm there.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I let that thought pass.. acknowledging it. Then I went, ‚Äúhuh! I actually just told God my self worth. I know I‚Äôm worthy of my desire to go standard and I can do the bigger things. So I will continue to choose to align myself with the intentions and that is what I &lt;em&gt;just did&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my great paying job was at threat lmao! After balling my eyes out and releasing my fears‚Ä¶ I had an inner knowing it‚Äôs all taken care of. Usually I‚Äôd skip training the next day if something like this happened. However, all I did was keep affirming I am an Olympian, I‚Äôm worthy. I AM! I choose to come to training this AM, because that‚Äôs what an Olympian does. Even tho for a moment I felt unworthy and was doubting. I affirmed even if I do lose my job, it will work out in favor for my dream. It‚Äôs working for me not against me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I read on the skating subreddit how adults cannot learn triples because they are past puberty and they have hips so it‚Äôs more resistance. It just never made sense to me why a person who trained triples pre-puberty can keep them all bc they have the ‚Äúmuscle memory‚Äù when they get hips‚Ä¶. Doesn‚Äôt add up. They said it‚Äôs harder to learn with hips. I actually laughed. I affirmed for me it was EASY. I AM. I AM CREATED FOR THIS! It doesn‚Äôt have to be hard‚Ä¶..I am worthy, I am capable. I AM A CHAMPION &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this AM on commute to training I kept affirming I AM A FAST powerful jumper. I rotate so fast. I AM A FAST TRIPLE JUMPER! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well during practice I was doing the usual warm up of my jump rotations. My coach stopped and said ‚Äúwoah that was way too fast. That was a glitch.‚Äù (We do it virtually). He had me do it 4x to make sure! He affirmed that indeed it was NOT a glitch and speed up‚Ä¶ that indeed it was ME!!!!! AMEN! \nI kept saying I Am! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also felt SO EASY! Just as I was affirming in the car. I for once finally came conscious of my foot going down and crossing as it should for once in my life. Just like I said in the car! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We moved on to triple rotation , and although I‚Äôm still learning - I already am it! He was also impressed how fast my rotation was and we had really good session for training triple jumps. They keep gettting better and better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I AM!!!!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When everything seems to work against you, feel the doubt, but don‚Äôt feed it. Show your doubt the other path, which is one of creation. Doubt can always choose your density if you allow it, YOU can always create if you fuel it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I‚Äôm an adult. And yes, the world I‚Äôm in many people only ever view children and teenagers as potential success. \nIt‚Äôs sad, and honestly‚Ä¶ kind of *weird* the obsession. I always viewed athletes who were in the elite world in their teens and pre-teens as ‚Äúwell no duh they can do it.

I was *waiting* for it to come to me. Rather, I changed the story. I said, ‚Äúyou know what. I‚Äôm not waiting anymore.‚Äù \n\nI decided to join a different countries team and plan to compete next year! I made a social media account and put myself out there. I get  a follow from a top coach in Korea. I notice the work they do and I really love it. I reached out to them for lessons and they were willing to coordinate . Well‚Ä¶. Few months later I had this YEARNING ‚Ä¶ THIS CALLING to just GO TO KOREA AND YOU WONT REGRET SOMETHING GREAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN IF NOT RIGHT AWAY. \n\nSo, I listened to it. Feeling nervous but at like peace ? ‚ÄúPeace beyond understanding‚Äù (Philippians 4:7) is what I felt. So I booked my flight and airbnb to Korea.

Also found out my mom had pre-diabetes but also reversed hers. \n\nI already have PMDD/ and iron deficiency anemia. It‚Äôs been a year since I  had iron infusions , and it changed my life. Nearly 10 months later my symptoms starts to come back. \n\nHowever it concerns me and looking back everything makes sense‚Ä¶.

    "communityName": "r/Fencesitter",
    "parsedCommunityName": "Fencesitter",
    "body": "So one reason why I‚Äôm on the fence, as ridiculous and mentally ill it sounds‚Ä¶. (Yes, I seek therapy and discuss it) is that I always felt I was never accepted into this world, and that I never deserved anything. \n\nPart of this toxic belief I have is any mom I see is beautiful. so any woman I see who is beautiful I deem, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs so beautiful. Ofc she can be a mother.‚Äù Crazy‚Ä¶. I know. I‚Äôm trying to identify why I grew up associating this with worthiness of motherhood. \n\nAnd then I look at myself and all I see is just ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù ‚ÄúPretty, but not attractive. In fact weird looking‚Äù. So my brain will write off being a mom because I don‚Äôt compare *look wise* to those mom influences on social media. Like for real, people do their makeup to give birth. I actually feel more confident and excited to see people more accepting of looking ugly and not giving a f*** what one looks like while giving birth üòÇ. \n\nSo the idea of me becoming a mom comes with a sense of shame, that I don‚Äôt belong. Almost as if I‚Äôm not one of the ‚Äúpopular girls‚Äù in middle school. I remember growing up I really attached my attractiveness and worthiness to popularity at school (I mean, that‚Äôs all I saw in movies and middle school it was everyone‚Äôs dream to be deemed popular and sit with them). That was just middle school. High school I didn‚Äôt give a crap what people thought and I honestly enjoyed it! \n\nThis also comes from witnessing how people treated my own mother growing up. We grew up in a single household (widowed). I would overhear my own friends complain about my mom, and other grown adults. It really broke my heart because I felt my worthiness of friendship was attached to being her daughter. So I began to view my mother as not deserving anything to be accepted into my ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù - toxic I know. That, I can thankfully say has been *healing* through therapy, growing, and self-awakening. \n\nPeople would comment my mom as to being weird (showing her emotions, her emotional side). So I became shameful of my own mother at the time. Again, that is pretty much healed with some residual left. \n\nHowever, now it‚Äôs time to address me. I have ADHD and Autism (although, I‚Äôm more skeptical that it‚Äôs autism and more of ADHD). I‚Äôm glad the world is getting more accepted at the idea of autism and giving people compassion. \n\nHowever, when I was growing up, I was labeled as weird and I would be judged for being myself (middle school). So because of this I would say, \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm never getting married or have a boyfriend‚Äù because, that‚Äôs what all the popular kids did, and therefore I‚Äôm ‚Äòweird‚Äô and ‚Äúlook weird‚Äù that I don‚Äôt qualify to have that myself. See the toxic cycle ?!? \n\nI mean I‚Äôm getting married soon so I guess I broke that toxic distortion of myself pretty well. And becoming a fence-sitter and realizing I do want kids is certainly beautiful progresses. \n\nHowever, I feel so vulnerable even putting it here on reddit to tell why I feel shameful (unworthy) of even having them. It comes from the fear or judgement what other people will think of me (looks, names , etc) and then project that onto my child. \n\nI know I have no control of that. I have to ask myself, ‚Äúwhat do I fear it would mean about myself if someone thought I was an ugly mom/weird alien face (üíÄ) / didn‚Äôt like your child‚Äôs name?‚Äù Etc., \n\nBecause yeah, what triggered this is some Redditor saying my future child name sounds like a trashy stripper. This is what pisses me off, be an adult and keep your opinion to yourselves unless asked otherwise. It seriously damages people and children‚Äôs view of themselves. That indeed triggered a part of me from the past. Feeling shame that I would name my future daughter a name that we‚Äôve come to grown and love. But god forbid if we were to name her what sounds like a trashy stripper‚Ä¶ something is wrong with us. The comment got likes and I just got downvoted . For what??? Being my authentic self. This is exactly the triggers I‚Äôm trying to heal. \n\nAnyways - I know I‚Äôm going to get wrecked for this post and hear ‚Äúyou have a lot of mental issues to deal with‚Äù I know that already :p \n\nBut seriously I fear that people will just vocalize constantly about my choices and make me feel shameful for creating something beautiful .

I remember growing up I really attached my attractiveness and worthiness to popularity at school (I mean, that‚Äôs all I saw in movies and middle school it was everyone‚Äôs dream to be deemed popular and sit with them). That was just middle school. High school I didn‚Äôt give a crap what people thought and I honestly enjoyed it! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also comes from witnessing how people treated my own mother growing up. We grew up in a single household (widowed). I would overhear my own friends complain about my mom, and other grown adults. It really broke my heart because I felt my worthiness of friendship was attached to being her daughter. So I began to view my mother as not deserving anything to be accepted into my ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù - toxic I know. That, I can thankfully say has been &lt;em&gt;healing&lt;/em&gt; through therapy, growing, and self-awakening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People would comment my mom as to being weird (showing her emotions, her emotional side). So I became shameful of my own mother at the time. Again, that is pretty much healed with some residual left. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, now it‚Äôs time to address me. I have ADHD and Autism (although, I‚Äôm more skeptical that it‚Äôs autism and more of ADHD). I‚Äôm glad the world is getting more accepted at the idea of autism and giving people compassion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, when I was growing up, I was labeled as weird and I would be judged for being myself (middle school). So because of this I would say, \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm never getting married or have a boyfriend‚Äù because, that‚Äôs what all the popular kids did, and therefore I‚Äôm ‚Äòweird‚Äô and ‚Äúlook weird‚Äù that I don‚Äôt qualify to have that myself. See the toxic cycle ?!? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean I‚Äôm getting married soon so I guess I broke that toxic distortion of myself pretty well. And becoming a fence-sitter and realizing I do want kids is certainly beautiful progresses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I feel so vulnerable even putting it here on reddit to tell why I feel shameful (unworthy) of even having them. It comes from the fear or judgement what other people will think of me (looks, names , etc) and then project that onto my child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I have no control of that. I have to ask myself, ‚Äúwhat do I fear it would mean about myself if someone thought I was an ugly mom/weird alien face (üíÄ) / didn‚Äôt like your child‚Äôs name?‚Äù Etc., &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because yeah, what triggered this is some Redditor saying my future child name sounds like a trashy stripper. This is what pisses me off, be an adult and keep your opinion to yourselves unless asked otherwise. It seriously damages people and children‚Äôs view of themselves. That indeed triggered a part of me from the past. Feeling shame that I would name my future daughter a name that we‚Äôve come to grown and love. But god forbid if we were to name her what sounds like a trashy stripper‚Ä¶ something is wrong with us. The comment got likes and I just got downvoted . For what??? Being my authentic self. This is exactly the triggers I‚Äôm trying to heal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways - I know I‚Äôm going to get wrecked for this post and hear ‚Äúyou have a lot of mental issues to deal with‚Äù I know that already :p &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But seriously I fear that people will just vocalize constantly about my choices and make me feel shameful for creating something beautiful . &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "I‚Äôm just crying. For 3 weeks now it‚Äôs been brutal hell on the ice. I just got new skates (Edea -&gt; Grafs) I don‚Äôt regret my new skates at all. I love them. My coach sees how much better I am with them, and I agree. I just feel I‚Äôm still adjusting. \n\nAnyhow. I have a lot of limiting beliefs to work on again, to flush out my system. I was in a very abusive relationship when I quit skating for 1.5 years. \n\nI had to start over technique wise at 18. My new coach really worked hard with me. Eventually I cleaned up my technique and got my doubles I  4 months and axel. I quitted right before getting all my doubles solid. \n\nThe break came and I was very depressed. I was 98lbs. My ex and his family didn‚Äôt believe in skating so i quit for them so I‚Äôd be accepted (dumb on my part). \n\nWent back to skating in 2020 but I lost all my muscle and strength and power. It took a lot of work to regain it. \n\nAnyhow - since then, I‚Äôve always had the belief ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt learn anymore, I‚Äôm incapable. I‚Äôm stupid. It‚Äôs too late to unlearn and relearn.‚Äù \n\nI kept working hard to change that belief. 4 years later, we start working on triple sal and toe/ double axel.  Something I always knew I could get to (but also had doubts). But it‚Äôs like now that I‚Äôm actually working on it ‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm starting to self-sabotage myself. \n\nI hold resentment that I quit for almost 2 years and had to relearn it all (which is fine, but I resent the new mindset I came back with: lack of confidence), I hold resentment that I never left my old coach to begin with, because he didn‚Äôt teach the correct technique (like how to rotate). There were skaters/coaches who noticed and whom I worked with at the rink, but didn‚Äôt bother to even suggest to me. I came to realization on my own. I just resent that no one said anything or suggested. Like, so much time was wasted. Looking back I feel so humiliated in skating.. when I was seeing a new coach in the summer of 2014, I had no phone then working on me, there was traffic due to an accident. I was so excited to start with this new coach. I get there and I was 10 minutes late. I was rushing and apologized. She didn‚Äôt even bother to look at my face until I approached her to tell her I‚Äôm ready. She yelled at me saying I was wasting her time and I explained what happened. She didn‚Äôt care nor believe me. She yelled at me and all the skaters were looking at me. I was crying. I just continue to practice, and I got off because I was so angry. \n\nIn Florida, I got kicked off the rink because I wasn‚Äôt landing my doubles so they moved me to the lower level freestyle (which is fine and smart move looking back‚Ä¶ but it just felt sooooo humiliating). I was 16. \n \nI resent that I feel like an outcast as a skater. In fact, I felt like I could never call myself a ‚Äúfigure skater‚Äù until recently. I actually have no skating friends, and it just feels so isolating. I see everyone striking up conversations and have skating group chats, joking with each other, but I‚Äôm just alone. I have ADHD/ASD. I‚Äôm very ashamed of my ASD. My whole life I held the belief that I‚Äôm not capable of being social / funny. So I never know how to respond a jokes. Instead I just make a fool of myself. I‚Äôm 26, and nearly half the skaters are 10years old to 18. So I feel like I can‚Äôt make friends because that will be creepy lol. \n\nI do go to one adult freestyle, but I just freeze and get terrified. I have truly no idea how to make friends in skating or build the support system, the only support system I got is my coach and technician and my wonderful partner. \n\n\nHere are my goals I want to change mentally: \n\n1) I want to stop telling myself I‚Äôm unworthy or incapable of learning: everytime I am at a new rink, freestyle full of people, and seeing people work on triples, it‚Äôs like alllllllll my skating skills flush out my brain.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm just crying. For 3 weeks now it‚Äôs been brutal hell on the ice. I just got new skates (Edea -&amp;gt; Grafs) I don‚Äôt regret my new skates at all. I love them. My coach sees how much better I am with them, and I agree. I just feel I‚Äôm still adjusting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow. I have a lot of limiting beliefs to work on again, to flush out my system. I was in a very abusive relationship when I quit skating for 1.5 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to start over technique wise at 18. My new coach really worked hard with me. Eventually I cleaned up my technique and got my doubles I  4 months and axel. I quitted right before getting all my doubles solid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The break came and I was very depressed. I was 98lbs. My ex and his family didn‚Äôt believe in skating so i quit for them so I‚Äôd be accepted (dumb on my part). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Went back to skating in 2020 but I lost all my muscle and strength and power. It took a lot of work to regain it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow - since then, I‚Äôve always had the belief ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt learn anymore, I‚Äôm incapable. I‚Äôm stupid. It‚Äôs too late to unlearn and relearn.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept working hard to change that belief. 4 years later, we start working on triple sal and toe/ double axel.  Something I always knew I could get to (but also had doubts). But it‚Äôs like now that I‚Äôm actually working on it ‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm starting to self-sabotage myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hold resentment that I quit for almost 2 years and had to relearn it all (which is fine, but I resent the new mindset I came back with: lack of confidence), I hold resentment that I never left my old coach to begin with, because he didn‚Äôt teach the correct technique (like how to rotate). There were skaters/coaches who noticed and whom I worked with at the rink, but didn‚Äôt bother to even suggest to me. I came to realization on my own. I just resent that no one said anything or suggested. Like, so much time was wasted. Looking back I feel so humiliated in skating.. when I was seeing a new coach in the summer of 2014, I had no phone then working on me, there was traffic due to an accident. I was so excited to start with this new coach. I get there and I was 10 minutes late. I was rushing and apologized. She didn‚Äôt even bother to look at my face until I approached her to tell her I‚Äôm ready. She yelled at me saying I was wasting her time and I explained what happened. She didn‚Äôt care nor believe me. She yelled at me and all the skaters were looking at me. I was crying. I just continue to practice, and I got off because I was so angry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Florida, I got kicked off the rink because I wasn‚Äôt landing my doubles so they moved me to the lower level freestyle (which is fine and smart move looking back‚Ä¶ but it just felt sooooo humiliating). I was 16. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I resent that I feel like an outcast as a skater. In fact, I felt like I could never call myself a ‚Äúfigure skater‚Äù until recently. I actually have no skating friends, and it just feels so isolating. I see everyone striking up conversations and have skating group chats, joking with each other, but I‚Äôm just alone. I have ADHD/ASD. I‚Äôm very ashamed of my ASD. My whole life I held the belief that I‚Äôm not capable of being social / funny. So I never know how to respond a jokes. Instead I just make a fool of myself. I‚Äôm 26, and nearly half the skaters are 10years old to 18. So I feel like I can‚Äôt make friends because that will be creepy lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do go to one adult freestyle, but I just freeze and get terrified. I have truly no idea how to make friends in skating or build the support system, the only support system I got is my coach and technician and my wonderful partner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my goals I want to change mentally: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) I want to stop telling myself I‚Äôm unworthy or incapable of learning: everytime I am at a new rink, freestyle full of people, and seeing people work on triples, it‚Äôs like alllllllll my skating skills flush out my brain. I start popping my doubles and even singles. I look like I genuinely cannot skate. Because at some point for 10 years, yes, other coaches and skaters would talk about how bad my technique and other skaters were with the coach I had. So it‚Äôs embarrassing.

My fianc√© is on his way to get therapy (once he gets insurance). I do feel loved and supported by him and vise versa. He brings so much joy to my life! Sincerely my biggest cheerleader. He really is patient with my OCD. \n\nHe has made a lot of progress in terms how he regulates his emotions. Even his friends saw a huge difference. He never wants to hurt me etc and same. \n\nHowever, ever since he‚Äôs been unemployed (late December) him and I have been snappy with each other , defensive , and both react. He has never physically laid a finger on me. ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt happen everyday , but I‚Äôd say every week we would bicker and get defensive .

I‚Äôm trying so hard not to reassurance week through my fianc√©. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does exposure therapy as it typically increases anxiety - does the break up urges also increase feel more real? ;(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Geez if this author saw this post he definitely would say break up or ‚Äúif I were you, I would break up.‚Äù Eff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It wasn‚Äôt till time passed I realized it was a dream and the *instant* relief came flooding upon me \n\n\nFound out I was pregnant at doctors (3 months along). My heart skipped a beat and sank to my stomach ‚Äî the baby wasn‚Äôt planned. \n\nI remember sobbing in fear and regret. I couldn‚Äôt even believe that I was fencesitting and thinking I‚Äôd be happy with a child or wanting one maybe in the future. I remember seeing the doctor writing down notes and took note of my reaction and feelings and noted in the records that I showed possible signs for showing violence towards the baby. I was so scared now I was going to kill my child or that I was a muderer and didn‚Äôt know it yet. My ocd was activated .\n\nMy main fear was my husband dying suddenly during developmental years (0-19) and me being a single mother. Just as my mom was. \nI was in anger and sorrow. In my dream, I imagined me having the strong desire to commit s****ide , but not the courage. I remember feeling that way. I remember being more miserable living day to day wishing I was dead. I remember feeling trapped, as that my choice was taken away from me. I resented myself so much for not believing I was in the CF side, and , asking my husband to get snipped. I didn‚Äôt resent my husband at all actually (and this is something I fear in real life). I just resented myself, and, the child a bit. \n\nI remember kicking myself in the foot , saying I‚Äôd rather endure the grief of not having a kid than having one. In my dream: Yeah part of me would like a kid, but reality is it‚Äôs too much for me to handle emotionally (risk of disability and being a single parent , and what if become a single parent with the child having a disability where it requires full time care till they die?). I had so much regret and sorrow, it was hard to swallow. \nA factor to consider was I just got the news. So it was very raw. \n\nPart of me did process in that moment ‚ÄúI will adapt to this.‚Äù ‚Äî I remember the fear of pregnancy being a big one. What if I die during pregnancy because of the baby? What if I bleed to death giving birth then dying? \n\nIn my dream my husband was very calm, held my hand and cuddle me ‚Äúwe will be okay. Everything will be okay.‚Äù And this is something that he would do in real life. I remember feeling safe with him and hearing that. But it was the fear of him suddenly dying.  \n\nI just remember feeling and wishing this was all a dream LOL! I remember feeling relieved in the dream that it wasn‚Äôt true (I was looking for evidence) but then crushed in anger and grief that it was real because of the 5D ultrasound he took. It was a quite developed baby girl with brown hair. \n\nI woke up in real life finally realizing it was just a dream and I said ‚Äúoh thank god‚Äù. This really has me thinking a lot more now, and even just more confused. \n\nHowever , it confirmed what Meryl says in her podcasts she‚Äôs in and her book. The importance of making a conscious decision. And that an indecision is a decision in itself , but we don‚Äôt own that decision. She made a very interesting point  (changed my whole perspective about decision making in general, not just with the topic of kids): that it‚Äôs important we make the conscious decision because then we can own it. You will find joy in the decision you make because it was *yours*. \n\nIf anything, this makes me more confident where I stand now: I don‚Äôt want a kid in my present moment, but I‚Äôll continue to re-evaluate in a decade. I also don‚Äôt want an accident, I want a conscious decision \n\nIn summary:\n\n-fear of being trapped \n-fear of loss (my husband, choice) \n-fear of death (physically and emotionally)",

I just resented myself, and, the child a bit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember kicking myself in the foot , saying I‚Äôd rather endure the grief of not having a kid than having one. In my dream: Yeah part of me would like a kid, but reality is it‚Äôs too much for me to handle emotionally (risk of disability and being a single parent , and what if become a single parent with the child having a disability where it requires full time care till they die?). I had so much regret and sorrow, it was hard to swallow. \nA factor to consider was I just got the news. So it was very raw. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me did process in that moment ‚ÄúI will adapt to this.‚Äù ‚Äî I remember the fear of pregnancy being a big one. What if I die during pregnancy because of the baby? What if I bleed to death giving birth then dying? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my dream my husband was very calm, held my hand and cuddle me ‚Äúwe will be okay. Everything will be okay.‚Äù And this is something that he would do in real life. I remember feeling safe with him and hearing that. But it was the fear of him suddenly dying.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just remember feeling and wishing this was all a dream LOL! I remember feeling relieved in the dream that it wasn‚Äôt true (I was looking for evidence) but then crushed in anger and grief that it was real because of the 5D ultrasound he took. It was a quite developed baby girl with brown hair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in real life finally realizing it was just a dream and I said ‚Äúoh thank god‚Äù. This really has me thinking a lot more now, and even just more confused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However , it confirmed what Meryl says in her podcasts she‚Äôs in and her book. The importance of making a conscious decision. And that an indecision is a decision in itself , but we don‚Äôt own that decision. She made a very interesting point  (changed my whole perspective about decision making in general, not just with the topic of kids): that it‚Äôs important we make the conscious decision because then we can own it. You will find joy in the decision you make because it was &lt;em&gt;yours&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anything, this makes me more confident where I stand now: I don‚Äôt want a kid in my present moment, but I‚Äôll continue to re-evaluate in a decade. I also don‚Äôt want an accident, I want a conscious decision &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-fear of being trapped \n-fear of loss (my husband, choice) \n-fear of death (physically and emotionally)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Gf is very competitive, stubborn person and cares *a lot* about what people think of *her* on and off social media. \n\nHer and boyfriend have been together almost a year now. She always explained how there wasn‚Äôt much emotional connection but I think that might of changed. They also have a lot of different life goals. She‚Äôs a very stubborn person. She‚Äôs so triggering to my OCD. \n\nAnyhow.. my fianc√© went to a wedding this past weekend and they were there. Apparently he overheard a lot of things. Gf mentions ‚Äúwhat about us?‚Äù (In terms of when will they get married). Bf then says about her problems with commitment. Apparently he told my fianc√© he needed to be alone with her to have a serious conversation with her. \n\nThis explains so much now. Boyfriend was checking out so much emotionally during the hike next day  and whenever the topic of relationships came up, he put his head down. When we were hiking she was also asking him questions what would help him feel more committed ‚Äî tbh, I think bf has relationship anxiety in general and doesn‚Äôt know it. But also his gf is very stubborn and super black and white (no flexibility). \n\nMy fianc√© caught up with him and he asked him how are things in general, and how are they. He said ‚Äúit‚Äôs aight. It‚Äôs alright.‚Äù And tbh this *shocked* me but also kind of confirmed ? Idk. Because if you look at both their social medias they post pictures of those ‚Äúcouple goals‚Äù and overly romantic photos every week. (Holding hands, kissing, couple posing in sunset);  He sends her fresh flowers every week, and she‚Äôs posts them every week. You would think they have the most perfect relationship! \n\nAt the wedding bf said ‚Äúr u gonna post the photo?‚Äù And girlfriend made a passive joke ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always the one that posts , and you never post me!‚Äù And bf rolls eyes and says ‚Äúshe always cares what people think on social media.‚Äù \n\nYeah‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not what it appears to be guys.

    "body": "Hi everyone. I cannot believe I‚Äôm typing this! I just got the call I secured my first full-time gig in my field! Best part ? Starting salary for *entry level* is 6-figures! I am in pure awe‚Ä¶.pure *amazement*. This is truly my second top manifestation besides my fianc√©. Let me tell you my story: \n\n I (25f) had $34 to my name as 1 month ago. I got married young (21yrs) to some sore loser who abused me and had an affair with my lifelong BFF. I got out quickly with nothing attached. But when I got divorced I was left with no money, and in addition I made stupid money choices. My whole mental state was projected in 3D. I went back to school and got an internship (another manifestation). It was only 6 months and they couldn‚Äôt extend it. I went from 26$/hr to jobless , and I had no savings bc All that money was going towards CCs. I was jobless in September 2022, and racked up more debt (12k over the months). I got a job in October as IT help desk. I was working on manifesting my other real job. Well, month after IT job, I got my cyber internship for another very reputable company. It was indefinite internship till I got my first job. It aid 20$/hr (major pay cut) but I took it because it was exactly what I asked for (WFH, government-affiliated, work life balance) I was content enough to take the giant pay cut.  Life got much better. I started paying much debt off as possible (down to 3k ish now) \n\n Over course of time I decided it‚Äôs time for me to get a full time job considering I won‚Äôt have benefits in September, and I really want to pay off my debt. I affirmed ‚ÄúI will make 6 figures by October this year, no ifs ands or buts ‚Äú. When I told some friends, they *laughed* and everyone told me the odds of finding a job for entry level is close to nothing. I didn‚Äôt believe otherwise. Over the course of time one can quite say I became ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù) I found a position at Google that i qualified for and made internal connections. I got denied right away and I asked why. Turns out , they instantly gave the job to an internal applicant and they apologized the posting was still up (I worked one week on that resume) but they sent all my info to recruitment. I just accepted it and kept affirming ‚ÄúI have the job. I have 6 figures.‚Äù \n\nI started to *act like I had 6 figures* even tho my back account was in the red. Every time I bought something (food or gas whatever it was or see a bill) my stomach would clinch and I‚Äôd worry how will I pay this off? Just more debt racking up! I shifted: I said ‚ÄúI have plenty of money. Money is no issues. It flows in my back account.‚Äù This made me buy my groceries with contentment and peace, gas - whatever I bought. Total opposite of my 3D projection.  \n\nI kept applying and had interviews , all ghosted or denied or not chosen. Long story short: it‚Äôs august and everything is falling apart. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being denied jobs. All I want to do is live! Be an adult! And work towards bettering myself for my fianc√© and I to be married (he‚Äôs working on himself money wise too). My car breaks down and my credit card is maxed out (day before I get paid, too) and I only had 34$ to my name. My mom thankfully helped me out and my fianc√©. But that was stressful and scary. I just cried. All I wanted was change. In that moment I affirmed: ‚ÄúI make 6 figures. Money is no issue for me.‚Äù My inner state started to change internally. Well I get my car back, and went to see my fianc√© for the weekend and attend my friends wedding , basically broke. I just kept affirming I made 6 figures. I found a dress I have and I put on my makeup as if I was making 6 figures, walked and talked with confidence as if money is no issue. I went to the beach as if I had no issues. My fianc√© lives near a celebrity wealthy area, so I went to one of the higher end towns and just walked around with the mindset of ‚ÄúI have money. This is my home. I‚Äôm so content that I don‚Äôt have to worry about this!‚Äù My 3D , dead beat broke lmao. \n\nI get back, and 2 weeks later my car breaks down *again* in that very moment I was ft my fianc√© and I balled my eyes out.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone. I cannot believe I‚Äôm typing this! I just got the call I secured my first full-time gig in my field! Best part ? Starting salary for &lt;em&gt;entry level&lt;/em&gt; is 6-figures! I am in pure awe‚Ä¶.pure &lt;em&gt;amazement&lt;/em&gt;. This is truly my second top manifestation besides my fianc√©. Let me tell you my story: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I (25f) had $34 to my name as 1 month ago. I got married young (21yrs) to some sore loser who abused me and had an affair with my lifelong BFF. I got out quickly with nothing attached. But when I got divorced I was left with no money, and in addition I made stupid money choices. My whole mental state was projected in 3D. I went back to school and got an internship (another manifestation). It was only 6 months and they couldn‚Äôt extend it. I went from 26$/hr to jobless , and I had no savings bc All that money was going towards CCs. I was jobless in September 2022, and racked up more debt (12k over the months). I got a job in October as IT help desk. I was working on manifesting my other real job. Well, month after IT job, I got my cyber internship for another very reputable company. It was indefinite internship till I got my first job. It aid 20$/hr (major pay cut) but I took it because it was exactly what I asked for (WFH, government-affiliated, work life balance) I was content enough to take the giant pay cut.  Life got much better. I started paying much debt off as possible (down to 3k ish now) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over course of time I decided it‚Äôs time for me to get a full time job considering I won‚Äôt have benefits in September, and I really want to pay off my debt. I affirmed ‚ÄúI will make 6 figures by October this year, no ifs ands or buts ‚Äú. When I told some friends, they &lt;em&gt;laughed&lt;/em&gt; and everyone told me the odds of finding a job for entry level is close to nothing. I didn‚Äôt believe otherwise. Over the course of time one can quite say I became ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù) I found a position at Google that i qualified for and made internal connections. I got denied right away and I asked why. Turns out , they instantly gave the job to an internal applicant and they apologized the posting was still up (I worked one week on that resume) but they sent all my info to recruitment. I just accepted it and kept affirming ‚ÄúI have the job. I have 6 figures.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to &lt;em&gt;act like I had 6 figures&lt;/em&gt; even tho my back account was in the red. Every time I bought something (food or gas whatever it was or see a bill) my stomach would clinch and I‚Äôd worry how will I pay this off? Just more debt racking up! I shifted: I said ‚ÄúI have plenty of money. Money is no issues. It flows in my back account.‚Äù This made me buy my groceries with contentment and peace, gas - whatever I bought. Total opposite of my 3D projection.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept applying and had interviews , all ghosted or denied or not chosen. Long story short: it‚Äôs august and everything is falling apart. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being denied jobs. All I want to do is live! Be an adult! And work towards bettering myself for my fianc√© and I to be married (he‚Äôs working on himself money wise too). My car breaks down and my credit card is maxed out (day before I get paid, too) and I only had 34$ to my name. My mom thankfully helped me out and my fianc√©. But that was stressful and scary. I just cried. All I wanted was change. In that moment I affirmed: ‚ÄúI make 6 figures. Money is no issue for me.‚Äù My inner state started to change internally. Well I get my car back, and went to see my fianc√© for the weekend and attend my friends wedding , basically broke. I just kept affirming I made 6 figures. I found a dress I have and I put on my makeup as if I was making 6 figures, walked and talked with confidence as if money is no issue. I went to the beach as if I had no issues. My fianc√© lives near a celebrity wealthy area, so I went to one of the higher end towns and just walked around with the mindset of ‚ÄúI have money. This is my home. I‚Äôm so content that I don‚Äôt have to worry about this!‚Äù My 3D , dead beat broke lmao. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get back, and 2 weeks later my car breaks down &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; in that very moment I was ft my fianc√© and I balled my eyes out. I was so done. Just &lt;em&gt;so done&lt;/em&gt;. Again?!? In that moment , I called out to God ‚ÄúYawh‚Äù and said,  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so done. I have the job. I‚Äôm making 6 figures. I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just going to happen. God (YWAH) idk how you‚Äôll make it happen, not my job, I just have faith that &lt;em&gt;you will&lt;/em&gt; by October - no exception.
