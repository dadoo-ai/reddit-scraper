In my situation bootcamp was a fine experience, it was an aggressive learning environment (it’s literally called bootcamp), I don’t regret it. I am neither for or against bootcamp. I’m just someone who grabs the reigns even when they’re slightly out of reach. \n\nAlso. Different job market. \n\nOriginal post: \n\nI graduated from a university coding bootcamp in 2020, program cost at the time was $12k. It’s now 4 years later and think it might be helpful to share my post bootcamp grad experience getting a job, and the roles I’ve held these past few years. \n\nTowards the end of the program I updated my LinkedIn and added my projects and portfolio. I had been in sales for 6 years prior. Right after graduation I applied to multiple developer roles a day (I tailored my resume to every. single. job description) and after about 30 applications I decided to get my Salesforce Admin certification. I was a salesforce super user at my prior job and I had a lot of experience leveraging the system to improve outcomes in my sales and service processes which was great content for interviews and cover letters. I shifted to applying to Salesforce Admin roles and got a lot more responses and traction with that route. \n\nI landed a job roughly 3 months after graduation as an sf admin at a tiny company, $87k fully remote. \n\nI was promoted once and went through 2 review cycles at that company and when I left I was at $108k. \n\nI am now at a huge enterprise and I have the opportunity to work on Salesforce Developer tasks. I’ve started conversations to move into development and think I’ll be able to move into that role in within the next year. The average salary for an sf dev at my company is $137k, still remote. \n\nMy advice for post bootcamp job seekers is work hard on your personal narrative. Draw from all of your past experience to establish yourself as knowledgeable and capable. Also polish your narrative on why you chose to do a bootcamp - it can be a great way to talk about your drive and ambition. \n\nIf you are considering a bootcamp for career transition or jump start, just know that it’s not a magic bullet or secret door to tons of money quickly. I believe everyone can find a way to standout. Find yours and work really hard on how you communicate it. If you can’t potentially wait years to finally become an engineer or developer then it might not be the right choice for you.\n\nLet me know if this post is helpful, useless, encouraging, discouraging - open to feedback and questions.",

When you use Leads, you can convert a lead and choose to create a related account and a related opportunity in the same step, but this can lead to duplicate everything (accounts contacts and opps). Not to mention the possibility of having one individual in the system as both a Lead and a Contact. This can lead to sales users stepping on each others toes, and confusing marketing communications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leads work when marketing and sales have a solid working agreement that doesn&amp;#39;t change the definition of lead qualification and conversion significantly and frequently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contacts can never move back to Leads, or un-convert, so you have to decide what it means for a contact if you lose the related opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think Leads are necessary and can actually cause quite the headache. I get the argument that you can track who you have and have not engaged with based on Lead --&amp;gt; Contact conversion, but you can also do that with Activities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Theres a lot of nuance to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But lots of negative consequences going under the radar.. \n\n&gt;**Is preschool too expensive for even the more stable families?** \n\nYes. Daycare with pre-k for 2 kids in our area is more than rent in a 3-br apartment or house. \n\n&gt;**Are parents just too involved in their own lives?** \n\nI think that would be the minority. I think it is more that parents are too involved in their kids lives, see below. \n\n&gt;**Are todays parents just doing everything for them because it is easier?** \n\nYES. At least in public places. There is no community patience for children. And parents who create teachable moments in public spaces are often then seen as selfish or lacking respect for those around them. It is a fine line I am self conscious about daily.. \n\nSome parents on the playground will go out of their way to mention they send their child to a play-based Montessori school, but then follow their child incessantly around the playground and narrate the entire experience. Asking AND answering their own questions along the way. Which leads me to another thought..  \n\nSo many kids we know have speech delays.. the number one thing I notice being around these families is that the parents do ALL of the talking for their child and leave zero time for the child to process or respond. The anxiety in the communication is subtle but palpable. We know 3 year olds that can't communicate an intelligible sentence to anyone besides their parents 😢 It does not seem to bode well for pre-k or kindergarten prep.\n\n&gt;**Are parents fighting the swing towards more academic rigor?** \n\nYES. Especially on social media. The pressure to avoid traditional school is suffocating. We choose to participate in traditional school, and because that is an active choice to be part of the community I find our experience so far has been pleasant and rewarding. We are also lucky enough to be able to send our kindergartener to extracurriculars like sports and supplemental art/academic enrichment classes. They are thriving. \n\n&gt;**Or have we just decided that everything is the schools responsibility?**\n\nThe requirement to add potty training to your schedule is crazy to me.. I do not agree that we should expect that req from a school teacher.  \n\n# TL;DR\n\nParenting is a different kind of hard these days.",
