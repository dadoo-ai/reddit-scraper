    "body": "Hi all, I'm about to go to a neurologist soon (3rd one in 5 years) regarding some lip/mouth numbness/heaviness and need advice on how to proceed here.\n\nIt started back in early 2019, with subtle loss of sensation in my lips, gradually worsening over time, even affecting my speech in the past 2 years. It mainly affects the area covered by a mask, including the tip of the nose. Everyday activities involving interaction with my lips feel peculiar, like eating soup or kissing, due to the absence of subtle sensations, akin to having an extra layer over the nerves providing sensation, similar to wearing multiple condoms over your lips. Heat makes my face prickly, cold is only really felt around that \"numb\" area.\n\nIt's not *complete* numbness, as I recently used a numbing spray for my throat that got on my lips, causing numbness, akin to dental anesthesia. So, some sensation remains. Additionally, the lips and surrounding mouth area feel slightly droopy or heavy, which could be attributed to age-related collagen loss, given I turned 50 last year. Sometimes, my lips get in the way, leading to occasional mumbling or difficulty pronouncing words, especially those requiring lip separation, such as PAH, BAH, MAH sounds.\n\nThe 1st neurologist conducted basic in-office tests and suggested either a panic disorder or Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP). An MRI brain scan was ordered, which was \"unremarkable\". There wasn't much follow-up. My insurance was decent at that time, but it was getting expensive to pursue so I gave up since my condition wasn't as severe then.\n\nThe 2nd neurologist in 2021, with worsening symptoms, conducted in-office motor-skills tests, which weren't relevant as my issue pertains to sensation, not motor skills. CIDP was dismissed due to lack of accompanying symptoms or abnormalities in blood work. The suggestion was to return in 6 months and explore options like referral to a Speech Pathologist and another brain MRI (to compare to the old one). However, I seek a solution rather than mere management. Due to limitations with insurance coverage, further investigation was costly and I gave up again.\n\nNow, in 2024, I have better insurance and want to try again as I'm having increased difficulty in enunciation, which sucks because my new job demands meetings and client interaction. I'm becoming self-conscious about it. I find myself needing to concentrate more on pronunciation than ever before. Almost like I'm over-enunciating to compensate.\n\nAny advice on how to prepare for my upcoming appointment? Google has never been particularly helpful. I've undergone numerous blood tests ruling out autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and other serious conditions. Stress and anxiety are unlikely causes as the symptoms have been very consistent. I consume alcohol moderately, typically 2-3 beers per week, and have periods of abstinence. I don't do drugs and I'm not on medication. Could it be a viral infection? I once suspected Lyme Disease, especially since I was hiking at the time, but that was apparently ruled out and I don't have other symptoms from something like that.",

My open enrollment period is Oct-Nov each year.\n\nI was under the assumption, that you could go onto your spouse's medical insurance not only to save money by not having two insurances, but also have the choice of picking the best of the two. It seemed like people got married just because of this benefit.\n\nI started to learn about the Primary vs. Secondary insurance hierarchy, but that was problematic as Kaiser only allows doctors within their network, and I wanted to access doctor's outside of their network (because I wasn't having good luck with their service) especially when it came to specialists. I was able to be added on to her insurance outside of her enrollment period.\n\nSo then I wasn't able to book appointments with an in-network Anthem doctor when i was showing Kaiser as my Primary. Kaiser was blocking me and I was trying to get it where they wouldn't cover the claim and then it would get kicked down to Anthem.\n\nI ended up getting some bad advice: I was told it wasn't mandatory to take your company's insurance and that's what was messing things up for me in order to get my wife's as a Primary. And so I declined my company's insurance last enrollment period as this would then make my wife's insurance the Primary. It seemed to work as I was able to book appointments. \n\nSo I'm 2 months into the new year having went to the doctor 3 times in Jan/Feb and accruing $850 worth of bills as part of claims that are now being declined by Anthem due to waiting for my Primary to cover what they can first.\n\nI called Anthem up, and it seems like that game plan didn't work. In order to cover these claims I would need proof that I didn't have Kaiser anymore and also that my company wasn't offering insurance.\n\nSo now I'm trying to figure out what to do going forward for the rest of this year. I probably have to eat that $850 bill, and I've sent an email to my HR department to see if I can enroll outside of the enrollment period (from searching this reddit forum, that doesn't seem likely).\n\nDuring enrollment period, I do have the option to bump my insurance up to a lesser Anthem PPO which being it's the same company as my wife's, the sorting out of the claim hierarchy would be easier to handle (according to the Anthem representative) as well as being able to go to any doctor (in-network with Anthem).  \n\n\nAny advice?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

So I don’t have a lot of experience tweaking video settings beyond some basics that we really didn’t have back then.\n\nI have access to a 2022 MacBook Air M2 16GB with an external monitor (34” LG ultrawide 60Hz, 34UM61-P if you want to look up the specs). I might be able to upgrade the monitor if that will help any with performance.\n\nThe actual question: \n\nIs there a hierarchy of settings to first downgrade to get a better performance on your machine without sacrificing too much? In other words, which setting do you turn down first, then what’s the next one, etc. I really don’t care about seeing every pore in the skin or every stitch in the clothing. The system automatically “auto-reads” and puts the video settings into Ultra mode and it does run and looks fantastic except it runs very, very slowly especially when there’s a lot of effects going on like fires on the ship or forest ambience.\n\nWhen fighting, it’s almost like a jump cut to the actual hit with the enemy reacting to being hit before it even happens. Sometimes in the wilderness, the characters will mini teleport if a few are dragging behind.\n\nI do realize that I’m on a Mac and on the Early Access version so maybe the full version will have more performance optimization, too.\n\nThanks!",

The system automatically “auto-reads” and puts the video settings into Ultra mode and it does run and looks fantastic except it runs very, very slowly especially when there’s a lot of effects going on like fires on the ship or forest ambience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When fighting, it’s almost like a jump cut to the actual hit with the enemy reacting to being hit before it even happens. Sometimes in the wilderness, the characters will mini teleport if a few are dragging behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do realize that I’m on a Mac and on the Early Access version so maybe the full version will have more performance optimization, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The 1099-K shows your gross receipts, but you are taxed on your net income.\n\nOnly goods that are sold for a profit are considered taxable, so you won’t owe any taxes on something you sell for less than what you paid for it. For example, if you bought a bike for $1,000 last year and then sold it on eBay today for $700, that $700 you made would generally not be subject to income tax.”\n\nSo I use eBay as an occasional online garage sale, I sell stuff around the house I don’t need anymore. I do not purchase items just to sell online. I buy things retail and pay the sales tax. Sometimes I get my money back or more, sometimes I don’t.\n\nOk so now I have to keep track of the original cost of things I purchase as the IRS only wants the taxes from the profit margin? What if I bought something in 2002, how am I supposed to remember how much it cost to figure out the profit margin? Or if someone gave me something when they moved recently and I ended up not wanting it months later? Or it was a birthday gift from 2010?
