It will redline the temp gauge at times, but then within 10 seconds return to normal operating temperature. Other times the temp gauge will spike, which tends to happen on an incline/decline (on or off-ramp), or on a sharp turn (that I take too fast). Other times it's if I'm in traffic and I accelerate to go around someone, it will heat up, and then the gauge will come back down. Fluids are at the right levels, it never stays hot - but it constantly spikes on me for seemingly random reasons.\n\nI'm also having battery/power issues - I have a NOCO jump starter that I keep in my car because my car often won't start, even with a new battery. When I drive for 10+ miles, it will start up right away, so I don't think it's the alternator, it appears to be charging fine. But I think I have a parasitic drain somewhere, and I have no clue where to start to find it.\n\nBut I have a suspicion it's my throttle body, as my idle revving is weird, and the wiring to/from the throttle body is brittle.\n\nI've been getting the following codes:\n\nP0123 - Throttle Position Switch A\n\nP0222 - Throttle Position Sensor B\n\nP0501 - Vehicle Speed Sensor\n\nP0573 - Cruise Control/Brake Switch A\n\nP0562 - System Voltage - Low\n\nI'm throwing all that information out there to see if it sparks a common issue with anyone.

I have been using Marketo for the last ten years, but have never seen the job market in such a dire state.  It's not just me, it's the tech sector in general.\n\nDespite networking and applying to hundreds of jobs, I have been unable to secure a single first interview. I am at a loss on what to do now. So, I'm pulling out all the stops and asking for help. If anyone knows someone who is hiring, is hiring themselves, or knows someone who knows someone who's hiring, please let me know. I would be grateful for any assistance.\n\nI am happy to share my resume, my experience, answer any questions, provide guidance here, or whatever is requested. I'm even open to freelance work if your company has a specific project they need help with. I have implemented and optimized a dozen separate corporate instances, and I know the pitfalls and benefits of Marketo inside and out.\n\nFeel free to reply here, or email me at justinmarketoking at gmail.\n\nThank you so much for your time!\n\n\\~Justin King\n\n",
