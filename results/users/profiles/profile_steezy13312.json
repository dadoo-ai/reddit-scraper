So the SSD is set up as a separate storage location.\n\nI just spun up a two node + qdevice cluster.

The way I see it, I could\n\n1. Rename \"local\" on *roma* to be \"sergiozfs\" - I don't know if this is even doable\n2. Reinstall Proxmox on *sergio* to the SSD as boot drive so local is on ZFS - losing the benefits of separate boot drive for sergio\n3. Some other reinstallation/reconfiguration of *sergio* such that the SSD stores \"local\" on ZFS but M.2 is still the boot drive on ext4 (this is what I prefer, but idk how to do that)",

I want to use replication for HA of some critical services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Node &amp;quot;Sergio&amp;quot;\nM.2 - formatted ext4, boot drive and &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; storage location\nSSD - formatted ZFS, set up as separate storage, labeled &amp;quot;sergiozfs&amp;quot;\n\nNode &amp;quot;Roma&amp;quot;\nM.2 - formatted ZFS, boot drive and &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; storage\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m learning that replication only works on storage with the same label... so my separate SSD ZFS storage isn&amp;#39;t supported for replication to my other node (&amp;quot;sergiozfs&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s my question: how do I fix this? The way I see it, I could&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rename &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; on &lt;em&gt;roma&lt;/em&gt; to be &amp;quot;sergiozfs&amp;quot; - I don&amp;#39;t know if this is even doable&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reinstall Proxmox on &lt;em&gt;sergio&lt;/em&gt; to the SSD as boot drive so local is on ZFS - losing the benefits of separate boot drive for sergio&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some other reinstallation/reconfiguration of &lt;em&gt;sergio&lt;/em&gt; such that the SSD stores &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; on ZFS but M.2 is still the boot drive on ext4 (this is what I prefer, but idk how to do that)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Some reddits use megathreads to keep discussion and links around a topic centralized, so that discussion can be centralized and unnecessary posts can be safely removed without removing the valuable discussion within.\n\nThe recent airspace violations and shootdowns of course come to mind in this circumstance.\n\nHow does /r/PrepperIntel feel about this? **I'll post a comment below this - upvote or downvote the comment if you like this approach.**\n\nFeel free to leave your own comments here as well if you have some constructive thoughts.\n\nSome additional thoughts I'm having here:\n\nWhat qualifies for a megathread and what doesn't? I'm thinking this would be used for events unfolding in real time - \"breaking news\" kind of stuff like the shootdowns here. As for longer unfolding things, like H5N1, I don't see it being practical. \n\nWe'd have to experiment with how to notify that a megathread is in place.

    "body": "Let's face it, a lot of us want to get away from the \"what's the best gun for the zombie apocalypse\" kind of threads we see elsewhere, and in doing so, we agree to have a set of rules so that we eliminate the doomer, fantasy, or offensive content we see elsewhere.\n\nThus, the objective of this sub is to share *actionable*, *reliable* information that relates to prepping. Before posting, you should ask yourself these questions:\n\n1. Will the community at large consider my source reliable?\n2. Does this information provide new information around *specific* events to prepare for? (e.g. increased risk of wildfires in western US, or a new outbreak of ebola in Africa)\n3. Does this information provide insight into the ability of myself or others to prep? (e.g., product shortages or instructions on a new technique).\n4. Is it new and unique to this community?\n5. If no to *any* of the above, *then why am I posting it?*\n\n##Reliability and bias of sources\n\nA lot of us know these days that the 24/7 news cycle breeds inflammatory headlines in order to get eyes, ears, and clicks. Some news sources have decided to align to certain sides of the political spectrum in order to have a guaranteed audience. Also, in order to get attention quickly, the accuracy of news can suffer. Thus bias and reliability guidelines need to be established here.\n\nMy personal rule of thumb - if a news source consistently praises one side and maligns another, it's not reliable, ***regardless if I personally agree or disagree with the point of view presented.***\n\nI strongly recommend posters find sources that are in the center-top of [this excellent, interactive chart from Ad Fontes media](https://adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/), or a similar news bias tracker like [AllSides](https://allsides.com) with published, validated methodologies. Note that on the Ad Fontes chart you can search for far more sources than the logos that are shown on the page - see the Search box at top left.\n\nJust because you found coverage of an event on Fox News or MSNBC doesn't mean it's wrong, but you should try to find a more reliable source to post here with. If NOT ONE SINGLE center/neutral source has picked it up... you should be asking yourself \"why not\"?\n\n###Personal Anecdotes\n\nAt the end of the day, people report the news. Sometimes breaking news is so quick that individuals, rather than news agencies, are going to be the main sources of information.\n\nSocial media postings may be allowed *temporarily*, provided they are supporting and adding detail to reporting provided by known entities. This is on a case-by-case basis and if the post is suspect, it will likely be taken down due to unreliability.\n\n##Analysis\n\nThere's a lot of overlap between the prepper community and fringe topics like conspiracy theories. That comes with the territory and is hard to avoid, unfortunately. As founder/mod, this is not something I ascribe to, and will not permit here. There's *plenty* of other places to go if you want that.\n\nNow, that aside, the question of facts versus analysis is going to still come up. There's nothing wrong with providing an interpretation of events, but I encourage you to be critical. \n\nThere are two rules in this area that has served me well in personal and professional life, [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor):\n\n*Never attribute to malice when ignorance will suffice.*\n\nand [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor):\n\n*The simplest explanation is usually the best.*\n\nHow do HR and OR relate to this? If there's [a system outage, it's probably user error or hardware failure rather than a hack](https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/faa-says-unintentionally-deleted-files-led-to-nationwide-ground-stop/ar-AA16xW9e). If a spokesperson says the wrong word in a statement, it's probably a mistake, not a coded message. If there's an earthquake in CA and a tsunami in Japan, they're probably related to tectonic activity and not secret government weapons programs.\n\n**It's okay to share something that you think has value, but you're not sure what others should do with that information.** Better to err on the side of acknowledging \"The catastrophe at this oatmeal processing plant is a current event and our understanding may change as we learn more\" versus \"IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AND WE'LL ALL BE CONSUMED BY A GIANT OATMEAL BLOB\".",

    "body": "*Note: I'm a prosumer; I don't have any professional background in networking.*\n\nDevices:\n\n* USG-3P (replaced by UDM)\n* USW-8-60\n* USW-Flex-Mini\n* NanoHD (wired uplink)\n* BeaconHD (wireless uplink)\n\n\nI decided to replace my ageing USG with a UDM this weekend. I don't have gigabit internet at my house (yet), my internet is on an advertised 100/20 connection. The main motivation, actually, was because my parents recently purchased a new house and I'd love to set them up with Unifi hardware so I can troubleshoot any network issues remotely. The UDM makes sense for them, but given the feedback on this sub I wanted to try it myself.\n\nI mainly followed [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/i2hvyt/sharing_hard_lessons_learned_migrating_from/) which was very helpful. At no time did I use the mobile app.\n\nI found I had to update the firmware in order to update the controller. The UDM I purchased I think came with 1.5.4.xxxx...? So I put it on 1.8.0-rc16 which allowed me to run the *unifi-os shell* command as [detailed here](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/216655518-UniFi-UDM-UCK-How-to-Change-the-Controller-Version-Using-SSH-#2).\n\nThe only issue I think I ran into was based on the fact I was previously running my controller on my Synology in Docker, and I'd forgotten that I was overriding the inform IP. So my devices kept cycling in \"Adopting\" and \"Disconnected\" mode until I realized what was going on.\n\n*Something to add related to the above - I powered down my Synology prior to the switch, but I didn't think about restarting it - my controller was set to auto-restart. I'm not sure if that could have caused any issues, but if you do what I did, give yourself some peace of mind and make sure the old controller is turned off and won't auto-restart during your migration.*\n\nAfter that, I was able to get most of my devices adopted pretty easily, except my USW-8-60. Even SSH-ing into it and running *set-inform* didn't seem to work. I think it was a combination of a factory reset of the switch, and rebooting the UDM after fixing the override, which finally got the two to talk properly.\n\nIt's been a couple days, and so far everything is working ok. I was able to move my NanoHD (since the UDM has wifi capability) and benefit from the increase in coverage. My major concern was that something related to my networks and firewall rules would get screwed up, and my Homekit/IoT devices would lose connectivity. But surprisingly, zero issues to be found.\n\nOne other small note - my USG-3P always ran hot, particularly when I had it wall-mounted vertically. The UDM, at least to the touch, runs warm but not nearly as hot. My APC UPS doesn't report any significant change in power consumption (based on my highly scientific method of glancing at the LCD display and trying to remember what it was before).\n\nI plan on coming back and placing another update in a month or two. Long term reviews are much more valuable than short term one, IMO. Once I feel comfortable it's stable enough here, I'll probably buy them one.\n\n**TL;DR:** Unexpectedly, nothing unexpected happened. Which is what we should expect.",

Every once in a while I see some random bugs which are just solved by ending the process and opening it again. Not a huge deal, just annoying.\n\nI can end the processes manually easily enough, but I'd like to at least have a script that ends the \"zoom\" process when turning my computer to sleep (if it's indeed running in the background).

    "body": "*For background, I've spent hours of research and configuration to set up VLANs with appropriate firewall rules, mDNS reflection, etc such that Homekit/IoT works well on my home network in general. It's just this one AP that's driving me nuts.*\n\nI am in a house where it's difficult to run ethernet, so I am trying to cover my home better with a mesh network. My current setup is:\n\nUSG -&gt; USW-8 -&gt; NanoHD [downlinks to] BeaconHD [downlinks to] AC Mesh. The AC mesh is not in a location where it can uplink directly to the NanoHD; it's on my porch.\n\nDevices on the BeaconHD or NanoHD work just fine. However the Meross switches connected to my AC Mesh frequently shows as \"not responding\" in the Home app, but they're consistently connected in the controller. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nIf I disable the AC Mesh and allow the devices to connect to my BeaconHD (weaker signal strength but it's possible), they work just fine 100% of the time.\n\nThe uplink to the AC Mesh usually shows around -63 dBm which should be okay, right? I've turned off Airtime Fairness and Band Steering. One of the switches is virtually right next to the AC Mesh with a signal strength of -43 dBm.\n\nNot sure what I should be looking for. I am concerned that the AC Mesh itself is faulty. I have posted my issues with this AP before here. I'd like to have increased signal on the porch for both IoT and my regular clients, maybe I should try different hardware?",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For background, I&amp;#39;ve spent hours of research and configuration to set up VLANs with appropriate firewall rules, mDNS reflection, etc such that Homekit/IoT works well on my home network in general. It&amp;#39;s just this one AP that&amp;#39;s driving me nuts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in a house where it&amp;#39;s difficult to run ethernet, so I am trying to cover my home better with a mesh network. My current setup is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;USG -&amp;gt; USW-8 -&amp;gt; NanoHD [downlinks to] BeaconHD [downlinks to] AC Mesh. The AC mesh is not in a location where it can uplink directly to the NanoHD; it&amp;#39;s on my porch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Devices on the BeaconHD or NanoHD work just fine. However the Meross switches connected to my AC Mesh frequently shows as &amp;quot;not responding&amp;quot; in the Home app, but they&amp;#39;re consistently connected in the controller. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I disable the AC Mesh and allow the devices to connect to my BeaconHD (weaker signal strength but it&amp;#39;s possible), they work just fine 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The uplink to the AC Mesh usually shows around -63 dBm which should be okay, right? I&amp;#39;ve turned off Airtime Fairness and Band Steering. One of the switches is virtually right next to the AC Mesh with a signal strength of -43 dBm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure what I should be looking for.
