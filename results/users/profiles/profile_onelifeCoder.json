The requirement is in all the lower org anyone can see limits of higher org . So I want the token of those orgs to make callout in that org . So how do I configure something similar to workbench which allows us to login to our org to get the Token. I want people to click on Authorize button that should open the Salesforce login page when a user enters their credentials I should have the Token. I think webs server flow van work but that would require connected apps in all the higher orgs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This I got to know from Know Your UAN where after providing her details and aadhar I got Two UAN numbers.  She didn't knew the password so I tried to reset the password for first UAN which is the recent one I was able to Reset it by giving all the details including DOB and aadhar and OTP recieved on her phone and I could see the passbook and all so everything is fine here.\n\nBut when I try to update the password of other UAN which is her old UAN created by first org  I am not able to reset password as her DOB is different for that UAN and on aadhar card. Actually first I was not able to reach the aadhar card section with her correct DOB and then she told me that in her previouscompany her DOB was different so when I filled that then the password reset page asked for aadhar details when I fill aadhar this is where the mismatch is happening and I think it's because of the DOB being different.if I could have reset her password then she would have been able to access her detail.\n\nSo I want to know what options she have I think only updating her DOB on the first UAN should fix the issue, but how do she approach it.
