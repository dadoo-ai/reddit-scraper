A digital camera has a sensor and onboard computer which measures the light and appropriately guesses the RBG combination for each pixel.

I will die on this mole hill lol.\n  \nYou're right it is just a person pressing a button in either case - I'm just arguing that the computation for the photo, takes more effort manually with film than with digital. Which, funny enough is the same argument you're making about prompts.... I'm configuring my tool, while someone else is just prompting the camera to take a photo.

    "body": "I had found this mint condition Nikon FG at a antique market and soon discovered its odd light meter. Basically the camera was designed so that if film was recently loaded the light meter wouldn't turn on until frame 1 was reached on the counter. However what tends to happen is the switch that controls that degrades over time and or gets dirty and stops working. The fun side effect of which is that it never allows the light meter to turn on!\n  \nWhen that happens the camera will only shoot at 1/90th of a second and you'll see the dots for 1/60th and 1/125th flashing in the viewfinder. According to the manual this means the battery is dead or you haven't advanced to frame 1 yet. Now before you say \"check the batteries and counter\" I had; the only way I could get the meter to function was to press on the back of the camera where the switch is and that sometimes got it to work... Have you ever had to squeeze your camera to take a photo?  \n  \nAs it turns out, this is pretty common issue and there's a way to fix it; open the camera and solder a wire to bypass the switch. After doing this the camera will always turn on the light meter (bonus tip: put it in M90 mode when not in use to save the battery). Sounds dangerous, but by doing this you're basically telling the camera electronics that the film door is always closed and the counter is past the first few frames so it can turn on the light meter. Actually doing this was pretty easy too, there's a number of Nikon FG disassembly guides/videos that show how to open it up and the contacts you need to solder are right under the hood.\n  \nAnyways, just thought I'd share this with you guys as one camera repair shop told me that they'd charge $50 to look at the camera, never mind fix it. They also made a sarcastic quip about how I \"can't trust anything I read on the internet\" ... *&lt;insert heavy sigh here&gt;*. For $50 you can buy a moderately used FG, so I figured I might as well try to fix mine and should I break it, I'd buy another one. I know this kind of repair job really isn't worth it for a cheap camera, but I really like the FG! It didn't seem fair that this odd design choice kills it after a few decades. So if you have an FG with a \"broken\" light meter, you might want to give this hack a try.\n  \n**TL;DR:** \"Broken\" Nikon FG. Fixed it by soldering a switch closed. A condescending camera repair shop didn't get a $50 consultation fee.\n\nEdit: Realized a photo would be helpful. Here's my [Nikon FG with the modified connection](https://i.imgur.com/FIyFO2g.jpg), see the black and yellow wires near the counter? You need to solder a bridge between them (use solid copper wire).

Ran &amp;quot;geth --port 0 --light&amp;quot; and that resulted with this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;INFO [09-11|15:50:53] Starting P2P networking&lt;br/&gt;\nWARN [09-11|15:50:53] Light client mode is an experimental feature&lt;br/&gt;\nINFO [09-11|15:50:53] IPC endpoint opened: /root/.ethereum/geth.ipc&lt;br/&gt;\nINFO [09-11|15:50:53] RLPx listener up self=&amp;quot;enode://&lt;em&gt;omitted a bunch of numbers&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a command I can use so that the terminal is still usable after running that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well it seems to work now. No idea what I did, but its syncing! So... Mission Accomplished? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless someone knows what happened earlier, I&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and just leave it as is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing to see here, move along...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It looks like it was \"Vivre sa vie: Film en douze tableaux\" so move along, nothing to see here [please disperse](https://youtu.be/5NNOrp_83RU?t=6s)...\n  \nBackstory: Film class in college about 2 years ago. We watched this French film from the 1960's (earliest) to maybe the late 70's about a prostitute in Paris. We only skipped to parts of it and I wanted to watch the rest and just now remembered it, but only a few scenes and not the title.\n  \nI'm not sure if anyone can peg it, but here goes...\n  \nScene 1: The lead actress speaks with a man at a restaurant I believe the topic was about life as the only quote I remember is \"la vie c'est la vie\" (poetic isn't it).  \n  \nScene 2: Lead actress \"entertains\" a client (trying to keep it PG here). Blue-ish room, man had brown pants and white shirt and was chatting with his friends around a black car before going inside to meet her.\n  \nScene 3: Train heist? All I remember of this part is a train is stopped and the men (I think 2-3) are chased into the forest. \n  \nScene 4: Apartment room(s) with white accents... very opulent (rich people I think) and lots of mirror/camera play with a man and 1-2 women. I think it was a day scene, but I also recall a night one as well.\n  \nAnd that's it. I don't know if anyone has a clue to what movie it could be or even if these fragments are of any use.\n  \nI've already exhausted Google... Turns out there's A LOT of French films involving women and sex be it paid or not. And the partial quote \"C'est la vie\" turns out to be of little use as well.\n  \nEDIT A: It could be Max et les Ferrailleurs, but I recall the lead actress having short hair. Also not Belle de Jour. \n  \nEDIT B: **Eureka!** I think I've found it, I'm 90% sure it's [Vivre sa vie: Film en douze tableaux](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056663/) c.1962.

Today my order was 2 milks, 3 sugar and an old fashion glazed aka: &amp;quot;The Kim Kardashians ass&amp;quot; doughnut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even have the audacity to tell me to check the order on the screen &amp;quot;yes that correct&amp;quot; then I get back to the office and low and behold I get to spend five minutes peeling the chocolate dip doughnut off the inside of the bag. I honestly wouldn&amp;#39;t care so much if this happened on a bi-weekly basis, but its been 4 months you&amp;#39;d think by now they&amp;#39;d recognize the six foot white guy who orders the same thing day in day out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Order the same thing everyday. They get it right once per week if I&amp;#39;m lucky. I&amp;#39;m eating Kim Kardashians ass right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/rant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "&gt;“Cryptocurrency is a lot like Enron. No one really knows how it works, but they're willing to buy it.”\n   \n   \n**What is A Ponzi Scheme?**\n   \nFor those who don't know what a Ponzi Scheme is, let me explain. A Ponzi Scheme is when a savvy schemer goes to a potential investor with the promise of a high return. The schemer then takes their money and “invests” it. When the investor asks for their money back, the schemer delivers the promised higher investment and it looks like a win-win. This investor then tells friends and family about his profit and gets others to invest with the schemer. They also experience the same promised returns and the cycle repeats.\n   \nWhat actually happened was after the shemer got that initial investment he was already persuading others to buy in. When investor 2 buys in the schemer then has money to give to investor 1. This is the base of the Ponzi Scheme, its not investing, its redistributing money from new investors pay out the old investors. This cycle continues until there are no new investors and the scheme collapses. It is at this point the schemer makes a run for it with the last investors money.\n   \n   \n**Why Cryptocurrency is Like a Ponzi Scheme**\n   \nThere are initial investors who get a return later if enough money is pumped into the system. This is done simply by telling friends and family and trying to raise the value of the coin via publicity. There is also a point where the value will reach its peak and at this point old investors cash out with a high return. New investors then suffer the fall as coins are lowered due to a high supply and low demand. The new investors will lose at first, but its not over yet.\n   \n   \n**Why Cryptocurrency Isn't Like a Ponzi Scheme**\n      \nWhere as a Ponzi Scheme is a straight climb with an inevitable fall like a roller coaster, cryptocurrency acts more like a bouncy ball. The coins rise and fall based on how much money is in the system. So when new investors money is put in, the ball rises, the investors cash out, ball falls. Then new investors see the low prices, buy in, ball rises, and repeat. There is no crash, and because the coins are not owned by any one person or organization there isn't a real schemer involved. \n   \n   \n**The Risk**\n   \nNotice that I said “a real schemer?” There are always schemers involved. Recently there has been speculation of online cryptocurrency exchange giants (Mt.Gox) has been called into question. These giants are at the center of price control, they can cause slight increases in the value if they see fit. So although they are needed for converting fiat money (USD) into cryptocrrency, be cautious of their prices and fluctuations. The currency maybe open source and for anyone, but what you're really paying with is trust. Trust that they send the goods, and trust that the price is right.\n   \nThat being said the reality of cryptocurrency is that it fluctuates  like any other commonity and only has value so long as there is a supply and demand and money in the system to give the coin value. So if you want to get into the coin market you should, but do your research and know that there is no such thing as a sure thing.\n  \n**TL;DR by [u/Tiredofnotbeingright](http://www.reddit.com/user/Tiredofnotbeingright)**\n  \nA Ponzi scheme only survives by constantly bringing new money in.\n  \nA Commodity/Asset only survives by establishing a large enough base to trade wealth as seen fit by individuals and exchanges.\n  \nA Currency only survives by establishing and maintaining a constant stream of money that flows from person to person.\n  \nAll of them need a base, and all of them will increase in value (absolute or relative) depending on how many people buy in. The difference is \"Can it survive once it has a certain amount of initial adopters.\"",
