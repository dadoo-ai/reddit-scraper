    "parsedCommunityName": "wallstreetbets",
    "body": "No one can deny that there’s a secular trend to need an immense number of GPUs, and that NVIDIA is in the catbird seat right now.\n\nBut the reality is that the semiconductor industry is still entirely cyclical.  It’s constrained by the capacity of manufacturing, which drives pricing/demand cycles in addition to surplus/shortage cycles as new fab capacity gets built. These are just laws of economics 101. AI doesn’t change that one bit.\n\nFabs take 5-10 years to build and are so expensive that no firm, especially not one as conservatively managed as TSMC, is going to start spending wildly aggressively like they believe the cyclical nature of their business just changed with one (powerful) new invention in generative AI.\n\nSo that still means this whole story will eventually be constrained by fab capacity.  And pricing/rights to that capacity gets renegotiated every 3-5 years for the big TSMC customers like NVIDIA, Apple, and AMD.  Unless TSMC feels charitable, they’ll be able to collect margins with a pricing war going on.\n\nThis is why I believe Sam Altman is going around panhandling for $7T like some sort of sage hobo.  He sees around this corner and knows his company (and NVIDIA) really have no moat here.  It’s the fab companies that have the moat, and the rest of the entire semiconductor value chain is beholden to their cyclical investment cycle.  The only way OpenAI and NVIDIA keep their stories in tact is if they can claim and manage a fab capacity moat that is so large it lets them play in a fantasy world free of economic cycles.\n\nThen, at some point generative AI will need to deliver on its hype, and new technologies always take longer to find their core use cases once disillusionment has run its course.  When that happens, capacity will have reached new levels, pricing will have skyrocketed, and customers won’t be able to justify the cost any longer and the economic cycle will move forward as always. Maybe we are very close to this point already.\n\nSo NVIDIA, and their other suppliers like SMIC, are all exposed to several different risks that will pop the bubble eventually (but who knows how big the bubble can get, I’m certainly not going to short it.  The pop could come from… \n\n1/ TSMC capacity not keeping up with NVIDIAs growth targets.  Either because growth exceeds the available capacity today, or because the investment in new fabs is known to change the growth trajectory possible within 3-5 years.\n\n2/ Fab capacity being won by other players whose growth stories and margins aren’t on-par with NVIDIA (like Apple, or the hyperscale cloud providers). \n\n3/ China making a move on Taiwan, even just the threat of a move could shift sentiment enough to pop a bubble.\n\n4/ Customer demand for generative AI use cases waning, or public interest in it waning (if no one has delivered the killer application for it by the next fab investment cycle).\n\n5/ Any innovations that increase the efficiency of LLM training and inference and reduce the compute capacity required by customers.\n\n6/ Regulatory pressure, especially from the EU, that would outlaw the use of customer data in any model training.\n\nAny one of these developments will alter the story overnight.  It doesn’t change the secular growth story of semis, or make them a bad longterm investment.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one can deny that there’s a secular trend to need an immense number of GPUs, and that NVIDIA is in the catbird seat right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that the semiconductor industry is still entirely cyclical.  It’s constrained by the capacity of manufacturing, which drives pricing/demand cycles in addition to surplus/shortage cycles as new fab capacity gets built. These are just laws of economics 101. AI doesn’t change that one bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fabs take 5-10 years to build and are so expensive that no firm, especially not one as conservatively managed as TSMC, is going to start spending wildly aggressively like they believe the cyclical nature of their business just changed with one (powerful) new invention in generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that still means this whole story will eventually be constrained by fab capacity.  And pricing/rights to that capacity gets renegotiated every 3-5 years for the big TSMC customers like NVIDIA, Apple, and AMD.  Unless TSMC feels charitable, they’ll be able to collect margins with a pricing war going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I believe Sam Altman is going around panhandling for $7T like some sort of sage hobo.  He sees around this corner and knows his company (and NVIDIA) really have no moat here.  It’s the fab companies that have the moat, and the rest of the entire semiconductor value chain is beholden to their cyclical investment cycle.  The only way OpenAI and NVIDIA keep their stories in tact is if they can claim and manage a fab capacity moat that is so large it lets them play in a fantasy world free of economic cycles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, at some point generative AI will need to deliver on its hype, and new technologies always take longer to find their core use cases once disillusionment has run its course.

Right now, everyone (NCAA, schools, TV networks, sleezy autograph brokers,  etc) are all making buckets of money off of the talents of these athletes.  Sure the students are getting free educations, get extremely expensive benefits (healthcare, training, food/board, etc.).  But those don't add up to the buckets being made off of them.\n\nSo here's my idea that satisfies both issues above:\n\n**Pay student athletes into a trust fund that is dispersed if/when they graduate from school**.\n\nIf someone drops out of school, is good enough to go pro and make buckets of money before they graduate, etc. that trust fund is instead dispersed to their school.\n\nPayments would not be salaries, but rather stipends based on specific criteria, and would not vary from player to player within each sport.  \n\nEach sport would have stipends defined for it, that would be determined by their school and approved by the NCAA.  For example a college football player might make $500/game for being on the team, $1000/game for each game started, $5000/game for each game won, $10,000 for playing in a national championship game, etc.  A swim team member might make $100/game for being on the team, $500 per win, etc.\n\n**Any additional money made by student athletes via marketing mechanisms that are approved by their school and the NCAA (appearing on video game covers, autograph signings, appearances, etc.) would have no financial limits and would also be placed into the trust fund.**\n\nA college football player for a powerhouse school that's played 4 years would accept a fund easily in the six-figures after graduation.  It would certainly provide a feeling of compensation to a player that might have never dreamed of playing in the NFL but still dedicated their life to playing a sport while others were making money off of it.\n\n**Upsides:**\n\n1. Another reason for players to stay in school.\n\n2. Colleges still benefit financially when they recoup money marketing a top talent that decides to leave school early and forfeit their trust fund.\n\n3. Pay is determined partially by the money brought in by your sport, while not restricting the amount that the stars of the game could be making. \n\nWhat do you think?",

Don&amp;#39;t be surprised if you see an orangered pop up in reference to a comment you made weeks ago however!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

A lot of the theories about Tyrion's heritage make the claim that his appearance is paramount to the need for these theories.  The theory states that while he's described as having white hair with one green and one black eye, his black eye *might* actually be a very dark purple, the Targaryen eye color.\n\n\nWell I'm going to throw this out there and see what the other avid readers and theorists think of it.  I think the purple theory is bunk.  And last night's episode gave me a good reason why.  I don't think its purple not because it wouldn't be important if it was purple, I think there's another connection that has been missed.\n\nTyrion has blonde/white hair, a green eye, and a black eye.  Those three colors in a set have any other significance in the books?  That's right, the dragons!  Of course this has nothing to do with Targaryen heritage or not, but I think its another example of Tyrion having a connection with (the) dragons, regardless of his heritage.\n\n\n**tl;dr** Tyrion's blond hair and green/black eyes match the colors of Dany's three dragons, connection?\n",
