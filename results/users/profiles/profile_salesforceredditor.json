Looking for outside views on this to set a path forward.\n\n\nI am an architect consultant working for a major company in a very serious industry with little room for error. I have grown this account from 50K to about $9M through a series of expertly delivered solutions, gaining trust, and penetrating different lines of business at this firm.\n\nI am allocated to a workstream for a solution I designed and staffed. The client did some shuffling and gave us a different PO. This PO is considered “new” though they’ve been there over a year and has industry experience. At first, I thought she was acclimating to the new workstream but time and time again she has shown that she has no idea what the business needs, or how Salesforce works, or even CRM best practices. She has also taken time off, declines some critical meetings, doesn’t attend pre refinement, doesn’t speak in sprint planning, other than to sort of police us and guard “scope.”\n\nAs the arch, I was happy to show the design, lead discussions on what needed to be done, and approaches to take. This was then met with her being combative, argumentative, publicly chastising me in meetings. What is most amusing is she will argue w me, chastise me, then the next day give direction that is “different” from what I said by literally doing exactly what I recommended the day prior. Most recently, she’s advocating for integrations and LWCs to be created for a temporary solution that could simply be a text field. \n\nI have relationships with other stakeholders who often have better scope. I spoke to her boss several times, as well as IT who confirmed the business need, and that this solution was overkill. I told him I’d need his support in this, because the PO generally doesn’t take my advisement. He told me that he trusted me, and to let him know if there wasn’t flexibility in that solution by the PO. \n\nWe had a very awkward meeting where again, the use case was being blown out of proportion. I pinged the boss to let him know the convo was going south. Instantly, my PO changed her tune and said hey this sounds like overkill, let’s do more research. I sent a written recommendation with documentation of several options, their considerations, risks, and tasks associated. I mentioned that one compelling thing would be to consider if integration will be needed for other use cases down the road. The next day, she declared that she would proceed with integration since the business had explained that there would be future needs down the road. No they didn’t, that wasn’t what her boss said, the other boss, IT, the literal Jira ticket, or the use case documentation. But whatever. You want an integration? You get it.\n\nSo here’s where I’m stuck: apparently my communications to anyone above her is considered “escalating risks” and sort of tattling on her. I guess I can understand that, and how awkward that might feel. If I was her, I’d probably trust the consultant we were paying $409/hour to make recommendations rather than feel threatened by their knowledge. It is literally my job to be objective and make the right solution. I’m not sure if she’s ever worked with someone in my role before? It’s just so bizarre. \n\nI escalated some of this to the account manager for previous issues who recently told me my issue was confirmed and validated by another stakeholder who had a lot of respect and vouched for my work. He hinted that a reorg was happening across several of our teams. \n\nSo - I’m sort of bracing for how to move forward and plans if the reorg doesn’t benefit us. \n\n1) just be a consultant and do what the PO asks, cut off ties to the bosses or report “all is good!” when asked.\n\n2) continue to communicate for the right thing for the firm, which will likely result in more tension. \n\n3) try to get off the account. For now, I don’t have other options but I am going to work on other efforts and hopefully can make the case to slowly fade out. \n\n\nI am obviously leaning toward #1 but it’s so fucking painful to be given so much direction and control by a person who is leading the project based on their own ego and making a power play to me, rather than understanding the business need. \n\n\nTLDR; help a consultant out!
