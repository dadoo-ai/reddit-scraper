I didn’t realize I’m passing along additional charges to the vendor when I’ve used the virtual one time cards. \nThat’s great to know, especially when it comes to small / new businesses. \n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. While nice (?) I don’t think it’s logical to extend the terms beyond what you are currently offering. When I come back in three months for more, I’m going to be adding additional monthly payments on top of my current payment plan?  OR would that mean I’m not coming back?  What’s the incentive to continue paying?  (I suppose that could be the same question posed in allowing 3 payments…but please don’t stop\nthat!!)\n\n2. There is no additional cost to the user when opting for the one time virtual card. It works exactly the same as any other credit card. \n\n3.  Can’t help with this one. \n\nGood luck!",
