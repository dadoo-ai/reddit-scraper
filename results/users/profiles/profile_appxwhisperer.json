    "body": "Most Salesforce partners know the pain:\n\n* Your listing gets buried on page 5 of AppExchange\n* Competing against bigger players with 10x more reviews\n* Great product, but customers never see it\n\nI’ve been helping partners as the AppExchange Whisperer for years, doing deep[ listing assessments](https://www.appxwhisperer.com/appexchange/assessment) and reverse-engineering how the AppExchange search algorithm works.\n\nThat experience has now turned into something scalable: RankLift.\n\n  \n**What is RankLift?**\n\nRankLift is a lightweight SaaS that helps Salesforce partners move their listings higher in AppExchange search results.\n\nIt’s 100% compliant — no bots, no scraping — just algorithm expertise applied automatically.\n\n  \n**How it works**\n\nIn just two steps:\n\n* Verify you own the listing (*quick check via email + domain*).\n* Subscribe. (*500$ for one month w/full money back guarantee*).\n\n\n\nThat’s it. RankLift runs in the background to improve your visibility.  \n\n\n**Proof**\n\nUsing the same methods (*under AppExchange Whisperer*), I’ve helped partners like:\n\n* Integrate.io (*ISV*) — #1 for “data integration” *(out of 1,902 listings*)\n* Paytram (*ISV*) — from page 5 → Top 5 for “credit card”\n* Candybox (*SI*) — #1 for “revops” (*out of 46 listings*)\n\n  \n**Why it matters**\n\nMultiple partners target the same high-value keywords. Only one can hold the #1 spot. RankLift makes sure it’s you — not your competitors.  \n\n\n**Try it**\n\nIt takes just a few minutes to get started:  [https://ranklift.appxwhisperer.com](https://ranklift.appxwhisperer.com)\n\n[RankLift Webpage](https://www.appxwhisperer.com/appexchange-listing-seo)\n\n\n\n(Happy to answer any questions — feedback welcome!)",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/adamerstelle\"&gt;u/adamerstelle&lt;/a&gt; pretty much nailed it! Couple other items to note:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Contractually SF states packages will be re-reviewed within 2yrs of initial approval. In reality its far from that (see pic below).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) For packages not on platform, many ISVs submit a light package for review and once approved, simply update to their full package. I would not recommend this and see it far too often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Data leaks are common and unless they&amp;#39;re considered a security risk, always end up &amp;#39;working as designed&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/29h93lnb343e1.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=984e54f62edb66d8deedf369eb7b47204a97b3c3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/29h93lnb343e1.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=984e54f62edb66d8deedf369eb7b47204a97b3c3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
