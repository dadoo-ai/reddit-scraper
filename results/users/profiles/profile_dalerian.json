    "body": "*The frontier town of Phandalin is a place of new beginnings, but old duties remain. A respected elder, the retired adventurer Daran Edermath, has put out a call for aid. Goblins, driven from the mountains by an unknown terror, have infested the sacred tomb of a local hero, Sir Odel. A plea has been posted for honourable adventurers to clear out the desecrators and ensure the knight's final rest remains undisturbed. A classic D&amp;D adventure awaits: can you be the heroes Phandalin needs?*\n\n---\n\n### About This One-Shot\nThis will be a self-contained, 3-4 hour one-shot adventure designed for Level 1 characters.\n\n**Tone &amp; Gameplay:** This is a heroic one-shot focused on teamwork and clever thinking within a classic D&amp;D dungeon. The adventure culminates in a meaningful choice that will test your party's honour.\n\nIt's a great opportunity for us to roll some dice, have a fun evening, and see if our playstyles are a good match.\n\n### The Potential Campaign\nFor those interested, this one-shot will also serve as a **\"pilot episode\"** for a longer-term sandbox campaign. Players who are a great fit for the table will be invited to continue into a full campaign set in the region.\n\nThe long-term game would expand on the themes of exploration, rebuilding civilisation, and facing down a growing darkness that threatens the entire Sword Coast. Here’s what you need to know about the campaign:\n\n**A Familiar But Different Faerûn:** We will be using the iconic maps and locations of the Sword Coast, but the deep history of this world is unique to our game.  \n**For Newcomers:** You don't need to know any lore! We'll discover the world's secrets together.  \n**For Veterans:** Think of your lore knowledge as \"lost legends.\" This is a chance to explore a familiar land with fresh eyes, where the truth of the past is a central mystery.\n\n**Advancement:** We will use a *Session-Based Checkpoint* system. For every session you attend, you earn one advancement checkpoint. After a set number of checkpoints (e.g., 2-3 at early levels), you level up. This system is simple, transparent, and rewards the most important thing for our campaign: showing up and playing together.  \n\n---\n\n### About the DM (Me!)\nI'm a returning DM, reigniting my passion for D&amp;D after some time away. I'm incredibly excited to get back behind the screen and build a fantastic story with you.\nMy focus will be on the core pillars of D&amp;D fun: exploration, memorable characters, and exciting challenges.\nI believe in running a collaborative game where we're all partners in crafting the narrative. This means I'm looking for players who enjoy being part of that shared journey as we bring this world to life together.\nMy priority is ensuring everyone at the table has a great time.\n\n---\n\n### What I'm Looking For\nI am looking for 3-5 players for this one-shot who are:\n\n*   **Ready for a Classic Adventure:** You're excited to kick in the door, fight some monsters, and be the hero for a night.  \n*   **Collaborative &amp; Respectful:** You're a team player who shares the spotlight. This is an LGBTQ+ friendly table, and we'll use safety tools to ensure a comfortable environment for everyone.  \n*   **Reliable for the Session:** We will be playing this one-shot on a Wednesday or Thursday at 6.30PM Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST).  Date will be set once we have the group.\n* Interested in continuing in a longer campaign if the vibe clicks.\n\n---\n### Game and Character Info\n- **Game System:** We will be using the new **2024 D&amp;D rules**.\n- **Character Level:** You will be playing **Level 1** characters.  \n- **Allowed Sources:** For this one-shot, please stick to the **2024 Player's Handbook**.  \n- **Pre-Made Characters:** A small number of pre-made characters will be available if you'd prefer to jump right in.  \n\n- **Platform &amp; Tech:**   \n    - **VTT:** We will play on **Foundry VTT** (I host, no purchase or installation needed from you).\n    - **Comms:** We will use **Discord** for voice and video.\n    - **Requirements:** A decent microphone and a **webcam are required**, as we will be playing with cameras on.\n\n---\n### How to Join?\nIf you'd like to join, please fill out this short google form: https://forms.gle/e9U6EK4zXGcK1kGz7\nPlease don't spam my DMs. I will reply when I am able to, but players will come from the form.\n\nThank you for your interest! I look forward to rolling some dice with you.\n\n----\n\nUPDATE: Thanks to those who want to join.  I'll leave it another day or so and then start getting back to people.\n\nIt looks like we have too many people for a single one-shot, so I'll aim to run this more than once.  Anyone else who's just seeing this or thought it was too late .. it's not, jump in.  If there's more than one group, we'll run the same one-shot so everyone has the same background.",
