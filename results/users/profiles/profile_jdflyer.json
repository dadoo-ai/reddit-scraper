There is some dead wood to clear still from Rangers, but theyve brought in 11 players or something like that. Same with Southampton, £120m spent on incomings, but the leap from the championship to the prem is such a big one. The problem is the extent he needs to get backed to succeed. \n\n\nMy dislike for him is bc I think nuance and being flexible are important in a profession and life. Admitting mistakes and learning from them is necessary for growth. These seem to be the antithetical to RMs approach to management, so I'll enjoy seeing him fail with the same approach every stop of the way. ",

His sisters make up two thirds of a small Americana band, [Wildwood Kin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_GjjhxX0X8ZanAIlA2UZDQ).|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Strengths, Weaknesses and Fit:\n\n**Strengths:**  Physical ability, Fitness, Pace, Directness, Crossing from byline, Confidence\n\n**Weaknesses:** Consistency with final ball, Can be sloppy in possession, Early crosses, [Defending](https://youtu.be/hNKKKjy7WL4?t=53) on an island\n\n**Fit:** Think we have our RWB. Exeter played much of last season with 3 at the back and 2 dynamic wing backs on the flank. Key’s ability was important in allowing the Grecians to play that style, and will surely slot into the Swans squad very nicely on the right wing. It does seem very clear that we are focusing on directness and flexibility when looking to bolster our attack. Like Ginnelly, Key played in many positions last season (CAM, CF, LW), with less success than in his traditional RWB/RW. Key has a good nose for goal when the play devolves, and can compete for headers in the box on both ends.\n\n# Prior Season Statistics:\n\n38 Games | 4 G: 6.4 xG **|** 2 Assists **|** Avg Rating of 6.89 **|** 68/168 successful dribbles\n\n44/66 Tackles Won | 29 Interceptions | 56 Clearances\n\n**Goal Distribution:**\n\n* 4 inside box\n* 2 header / 2 right foot\n\n# Best Season: 2021/22 League 2 Promotion\n\nKey came into his own in his second season with the first team at Exeter. He was a mainstay on the right side on the team who tied for the League 2 title with Forest Green Rovers, appearing in 99% of minutes for the Grecians on the season. After 1 goal and 5 assists in the previous campaign, he would go on to get 2 goals and 4 goals in 2021/22. Despite the final output, the performances on a weekly basis highlighted the potential that Key had ahead of him. He nearly doubled the number of chances created (26 to 42), and clearly was more free in attacking than either the prior or following seasons. Below are a series of highlights from 2021/22, along with his game log:\n\n* [Game Log](https://www.transfermarkt.us/josh-key/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/533912/plus/0?saison=2020&amp;verein=6699&amp;liga=&amp;wettbewerb=&amp;pos=&amp;trainer_id=)\n* [Goal vs Harrogate](https://youtu.be/-epGx6us0ZI?t=57) \\- August 2021\n* [Clutch Tackle](https://twitter.com/OfficialECFC/status/1434797766375510018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1434797766375510018%7Ctwgr%5E7be03f1de86552c84c2b045f56d25842e71b3954%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.exeweb.com%2Fforums%2Fthreads%2Fjosh-key.62433%2Fpage-14) \\- September 2021\n* [Goal vs Scunthorpe](https://youtu.be/BeaRf9NM2Mw?t=63) \\- September 2021\n* [Assist vs Stevenage](https://youtu.be/m8YHFHR7jy0?t=54) \\- October 2021\n* [Assist vs Oldham United](https://youtu.be/-OdUIg4PNjo?t=29) \\- November 2021\n* [Assist vs Grimsby Town](https://youtu.be/hNKKKjy7WL4?t=83) \\- Dec 2021\n* [Assist vs Northampton](https://youtu.be/zCcnHc87sWc?t=59) \\- Dec 2021\n* 2 Assist Performance vs Colchester ([1](https://youtu.be/D0Xgef2S7t0?t=6), [2](https://youtu.be/D0Xgef2S7t0?t=86)) - Feb 2021\n* [Assist vs Cambridge](https://youtu.be/BjQkFM9fO9s?t=81) \\- April 2021\n\n# Transfer History:\n\n**Youth Career:**  5 yrs at Torquay, 3 yrs at Exeter before being loaned to BidefordExeter were the benefits of the closure of the Torquay youth setup. Key looks to have joined Torquay at the age of 10 or 11, while he was being courted by the Grecians and a few other clubs in the area. He decided to sign with his hometown Torquay, with whom he stayed until the closure.\n\n**Professional Career:** Was subsequently loaned out his first 2 years to Tiverton before playing for Exeter’s first team the last 3 seasons.\n\n(Uneventful) [Transfer Value over time](https://www.transfermarkt.us/josh-key/marktwertverlauf/spieler/533912)\n\n**Previous Contract:** Signed his senior contract in 2018, at the age of 18 after performing well on loan for Bideford in the Southern League West division.\n\n# Injury History:\n\nNearly spotless injury history for someone who plays on the wing. Missed a few games in 2023 due to a tight hamstring. Outside of that, he’s only missed 4 first team games since 2021. Got COVID, but clearly hasn’t lost his sense of taste.\n\n# Misc:\n\n**My 2 cents...** I am not recognizing this team… 2 tidy signings before it’s hotdog time over here in 🇺🇸. Seems to be a mature and focused player, has more physical ability than technical, but has grown every season. Has always seemed to have the potential to grow out of Exeter. Another signing that sounds like they would have been a fantastic fit last year, but no sense in that talk. Excels when playing with open grass in front of him, he will slot nicely into RWB next season. Has good jumping ability and nose for the ball, he has an instinct for getting on the ball in 50/50s in the box.\n\nSunderland put a borderline 7 figure bid together for him in August 2021 (reportedly £900k+ in fees) but Exeter supposedly rejected the offers. Exeter fans have seemed resigned to losing him each of the last 4 windows, but after promotion in 2021/22, they were able to keep Key and offer him League 1 competition. As one would expect, a newly promoted team was more often on the back foot, and Key’s play reflected this overall change in play.\n\nI am excited about this signing, but like Darling or Sorinola, I think we will need to let him ease into Championship level competition.\n\n**Other Stuff:**\n\n* [Getting to know Josh Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvz17RMMXbw&amp;ab_channel=ExeterCityFootballClub): Exeter 2021\n* Transfermarkt has him listed as playing at CF, AM, LW, CB and LM in 2023, in addition to every spot on the right. After watching some highlights of Exeter City playing, they usually have him playing higher up or lower back on the right, depending on the opponent. Over the course of last season though, he did get time all over the pitch, partially to his detriment.\n* DevonLive Articles:\n   * [Key revels in more attacking role](https://www.devonlive.com/sport/football/football-news/fantastic-josh-key-revels-more-7892024)\n   * [Josh Key - the latest from the long line of academy products at Exeter Cit](https://www.devonlive.com/sport/football/football-news/josh-key-latest-long-line-4557019)y\n* 42 page [Thread from Exeter City Blog](https://www.exeweb.com/forums/threads/josh-key.62433/) about Key, starting in Fall 2020.Fotmob is best for game ratings and more granular statistics on league performance. I am not familiar if there are other tools out there that gather data in a clean way, but Key having more dribbles attempted than Ginnelly isn't a typo.",

Exeter played much of last season with 3 at the back and 2 dynamic wing backs on the flank. Key’s ability was important in allowing the Grecians to play that style, and will surely slot into the Swans squad very nicely on the right wing. It does seem very clear that we are focusing on directness and flexibility when looking to bolster our attack. Like Ginnelly, Key played in many positions last season (CAM, CF, LW), with less success than in his traditional RWB/RW. Key has a good nose for goal when the play devolves, and can compete for headers in the box on both ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Prior Season Statistics:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;38 Games | 4 G: 6.4 xG &lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt; 2 Assists &lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt; Avg Rating of 6.89 &lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt; 68/168 successful dribbles&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;44/66 Tackles Won | 29 Interceptions | 56 Clearances&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal Distribution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4 inside box&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 header / 2 right foot&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Best Season: 2021/22 League 2 Promotion&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Key came into his own in his second season with the first team at Exeter. He was a mainstay on the right side on the team who tied for the League 2 title with Forest Green Rovers, appearing in 99% of minutes for the Grecians on the season. After 1 goal and 5 assists in the previous campaign, he would go on to get 2 goals and 4 goals in 2021/22. Despite the final output, the performances on a weekly basis highlighted the potential that Key had ahead of him. He nearly doubled the number of chances created (26 to 42), and clearly was more free in attacking than either the prior or following seasons.

[One of those moments you don't forget.](https://www.tiktok.com/@blairmcnally1/video/7235607705929403674)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Strengths, Weaknesses and Fit:\n\n**Strengths:** Acceleration, Pace, Flair, Directness, 2 footed, Long Shots\n\n**Weaknesses:** Consistency, Stamina, Composure (slight weakness)\n\n**Fit:** He excelled last year playing a somewhat fluid top line role at Hearts, after struggling on the wing. It is still difficult to tell how Duff is going to line up, but with Barnsley he had most of his success with 2 ST. Leads me to think that Ginnelly will be given plenty of time to show his ability for us, pushing back lines and setting up finishes for others.\n\n# Prior Season Statistics:\n\n12 G: 5.9 xG **|** 4 Assists **|** Avg Rating of 6.86 **|** 33/64 successful dribbles\n\n**Goal Distribution:**\n\n* 9 inside box / 3 outside\n* 1 header / 7 right foot / 4 left\n\n# Best Season: 2022/23 Scottish Premiership &amp; Top Six Split\n\nAfter previously being played on both wings by Robbie Neilson in the 21/22 campaign, Neilson was non-committal on positioning in the first 3 months of last season. Gino factored in on 3 goals and appearing as both a RW and CF, while battling a hamstring injury. He played more consistently through Hearts good run of form towards the end of 2022 and into 2023, still bouncing between RW and CF, scoring 4 goals in 11 games.\n\nThe last third of the season was where Gino really started to impress with more regularity. He started off with a few quality performances, with [2 Goals vs St Johnstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnqf2JgFt6E&amp;ab_channel=SPFL) and 1 vs [Celtic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91FL7_9qk4U&amp;ab_channel=SPFL).\n\nAfter suffering a minor bone bruise injury, he came back with another 2G1A performance vs Ross County, with a [nice open field run, cutback and score](https://youtu.be/Hllz24QaJvM?t=24), along with a Ntcham-esque [right footed blade](https://youtu.be/Hllz24QaJvM?t=199) trimmer.\n\n**Top 6 Split:**\n\nPerhaps his best form at Hearts was during the top 6 split, where he had a split of 2G/2A with a 7.3 rating. Ginnelly scored the unofficial premiership goal of the season vs Aberdeen, only losing out on the award due to bureaucracy and deadlines, [a right footed cannon from 25 that sears into the upper corner.](https://youtu.be/C5ZqB7Esyvo?t=94) He would go on to score one more goal in the top six playoffs, [tucking home a nice back post run](https://youtu.be/Ahp_9eK16jw?t=178) to start the comeback vs St Mirren.\n\nHearts ended the season in 3rd on 61 points, an impressive finish after promotion the year prior. This was their second best finish since the Scottish Premiership was founded in 2013 (2015 - 3rd - 65).\n\nSide note: [Quick overview on the split brought to you by Joe Devine and Tifo](https://youtu.be/MQOqusgYaag).\n\n# [Transfer History](https://www.transfermarkt.us/josh-ginnelly/transfers/spieler/325104):\n\n**Youth Career:** 2 yrs at Aston Villa, 2 yrs at Shrewsbury Town\n\nGino received 5 first team call ups and played 3 games in League 2 while still on his youth contract at Shrewsbury,\n\n**Professional Career:** Josh has played for quite a few teams, and his contract has run out at each (Burnley, Walsall, Preston and now Hearts). It should be said though, that the popular opinion amongst Hearts fans is they hoped he would resign with the club.\n\n[Transfer Value over time](https://www.transfermarkt.us/josh-ginnelly/marktwertverlauf/spieler/325104)\n\n# Previous Contract:\n\n2 years - £100k/yr\n\nSigned on a **free from Preston North End**. Was on loan with Hearts in 2020/21 before tearing his hamstring and missing 5 months. Rehabbed at Hearts and signed a 2 year contract at the end of the season.\n\n# Injury History:\n\nRelatively clean injury history for someone who  plays on the wing. He ruptured his hamstring in early 2021, which I am sure factored into his slower start to 2022.\n\n**Major:** Ruptured Hamstring - Feb 2021\n\n[Link to TransferMarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.us/josh-ginnelly/verletzungen/spieler/325104) Injuries\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My 2 cents...** This is a great signing. Factored in on 19% of goals for Hearts in the season, and most of the goals he was creating were from open play. Has skill, can move along the whole top line, and won't be a huge line item at the end of the year. Cautiously excited about this guy, seems like a very Swansea signing.\n\n**Other Stuff**\n\n[Chant](https://twitter.com/AaronFraser37/status/1431715061412864004): oo baby do you know what that’s worth?

David Thorpe's nuanced views on player motivation and empowerment can be heard on this podcast with Beck.

Already more prolific than Taylor.

Sako surprises everyone and has a go for goal. Good job watching the near post by Fabi.\n\n65 - After a dicey 10 minutes or so, Fulton is down and being attended to. It has been a concerning enough amount of time, that Clement has done the reverse Mourinho, and joined the club on the sidelines.\n\n69 - Substitution: Leroy Feradona in for the injured Jay Fulton\n\n70 - Substitution: Angel Rangel in for Neil Taylor, Naughton moving to the Left.\n\n77 - An ugly run of play capped off in a sloppy Yellow for Kelly \n\n80 - Substitution: Nathan Dyer in for the real Wayne R. Looks like he picked up a knock right before coming off. \n\n83 - Half volley from Zaha from the 18 goes in.  **1-1** and there should be some stoppage time like last time.\n\n88 - I am speechless. **2-1 SWANS!** \n\n90 - 5 Minutes of added time. Let's seal this baby up.\n\n90 - Substitution: Jordan Mutch in for Martin Kelly\n\n92 - James Tomkins gets a yellow for clashing into Dyer. \n\n95 -- WHISTLE BLOWS!
