    "body": "***Posted this in the discussion thread on*** /r/coronavirus ***yesterday, but it's so full of people self-diagnosing and wondering if they need to get tested it probably got buried...***\n\n**\\[OC\\] Is the COVID-19 risk to children and young adults understated?**\n\nWatching my Facebook timeline fill up with parents bitching about school closures, then also at the reports that New York City schools will remain open, I was thinking about how the mortality risk for younger people and children is being presented as very low in the media and elsewhere.  So I decided to dig up some numbers, and I was hoping someone would check my assumptions/results.\n\nNote: I'm not a data scientist or researcher (will probably be obvious as you read through). Just a currently unemployed project manager with too much time on his hands and a lot of curiousity. Not sure the discussion thread is the right place to post this, but thought I'd try here.\n\n**Hypothesis: While the overall risk to children and young adults is low, the risk relative to other causes of mortality in the United States is higher than being communicated in the media and elswhere.**\n\n**Data sources:**\n\nAll cause mortality in the United States by age (2018): [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm#:\\~:text=Between%202017%20and%202018%2C%20death,13%2C450.7)%20(Figure%203).](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm#:~:text=Between%202017%20and%202018%2C%20death,13%2C450.7)%20(Figure%203).)\n\nMortality by age group for COVID-19:  [https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf](https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf)\n\nLeading causes of death in the United States (2017):  [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68\\_06-508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_06-508.pdf)\n\nNote: I don't have access to the underlying data, and the ages are binned differently. The COVID-19 mortality data age groups are shifted five years lower than the all-cause data from the US CDC. Theoretically this should result in understating the risk of COVID-19 by a small amount, but I don't think it shouldn't make a massive difference.\n\n**Mortality Rates: All causes (US 2018)\\* vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases**\n\n|Age (COVID-19)|Mortality: All Causes|Mortality: COVID-19|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|85 and over (80+)|13.45%|14.8%|\n|75-84 (70-79)|4.39%|8%|\n|65-74 (60-69)|1.78%|3.6%|\n|55-64 (50-59)|.89%|1.3%|\n|45-54 (40-49)|.4%|.4%|\n|35-44 (30-39)|.19%|.2%|\n|25-34 (20-29)|.13%|.2%|\n|15-24 (10-19)|.07%|.2%|\n\n\\*Mortality rate converted from deaths per 100k in CDC report to a percentage.\n\nObviously the mortality rates aren't directly transferrable, because not everyone will get COVID-19. Here is the infection rate required, by age group, in order for COVID-19 mortality to be the leading cause of death for the age group, and for it to exceed all other causes of mortality combined:\n\n**Infection rates to exceed annual deaths by category**\n\n|Age (COVID-19)|Leading cause of death\\*|All causes combined|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|85 and over (80+)|26%|91%|\n|75-84 (70-79)|14%|55%|\n|65-74 (60-69)|12%|50%|\n|55-64 (50-59)|19%|68%|\n|45-54 (40-49)|28%|99%|\n|35-44 (30-39)|34%|97%|\n|25-34 (20-29)|22%|64%|\n|15-24 (10-19)|14%|35%|\n\n\\*Leading cause of death ages 1-44: Unintentional injuries; 45-64: Cancer; 65+ Heart Disease\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nIt seems likely that age-weighted risk of COVID-19 relative to all causes of death for younger populations in the United States is being significantly understated. Using the reported mortality rates from Hubei compared to the leading causes and all causes of death by similar age groups in the United States, at a population infection rate exceeding 35% COVID-19 would become the leading cause of death for all age groups. At a .2% mortality rate (2 deaths per 1000 cases) and a 35% infection rate for children and young adults, COVID-19 would exceed the annual deaths for that age group for all other causes combined in the United States.\n\nObviously the overall number of children and young adults that will get seriously ill and/or die remains very low relative to the numbers of older Americans likely to die in a broad pandemic. That said, the message being communicated to parents and youths is that younger people aren't going to die from this virus, when the reality is that significant numbers of children and young adults may die compared to a non-pandemic year. In the worst case scenarios for infection rate (\\~70%), mortality rates for 10-24 year olds from COVID-19 could be double what you would see in a normal year for all causes combined (that wouldn't mean there would be 200% more deaths, since excess mortality is more complicated than \"normal\" deaths + pandemic deaths).\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* The mortality data from Hubei is a snapshot in time sourced from a preprint paper.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Posted this in the discussion thread on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"/r/coronavirus\"&gt;/r/coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;yesterday, but it&amp;#39;s so full of people self-diagnosing and wondering if they need to get tested it probably got buried...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[OC] Is the COVID-19 risk to children and young adults understated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching my Facebook timeline fill up with parents bitching about school closures, then also at the reports that New York City schools will remain open, I was thinking about how the mortality risk for younger people and children is being presented as very low in the media and elsewhere.  So I decided to dig up some numbers, and I was hoping someone would check my assumptions/results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;m not a data scientist or researcher (will probably be obvious as you read through). Just a currently unemployed project manager with too much time on his hands and a lot of curiousity. Not sure the discussion thread is the right place to post this, but thought I&amp;#39;d try here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis: While the overall risk to children and young adults is low, the risk relative to other causes of mortality in the United States is higher than being communicated in the media and elswhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All cause mortality in the United States by age (2018): &lt;a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm#:%7E:text=Between%202017%20and%202018%2C%20death,13%2C450.7\"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm#:~:text=Between%202017%20and%202018%2C%20death,13%2C450.7)%20(Figure%203).&lt;/a&gt;%20(Figure%203).)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mortality by age group for COVID-19:  &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf\"&gt;https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leading causes of death in the United States (2017):  &lt;a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_06-508.pdf\"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_06-508.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: I don&amp;#39;t have access to the underlying data, and the ages are binned differently. The COVID-19 mortality data age groups are shifted five years lower than the all-cause data from the US CDC. Theoretically this should result in understating the risk of COVID-19 by a small amount, but I don&amp;#39;t think it shouldn&amp;#39;t make a massive difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mortality Rates: All causes (US 2018)* vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Age (COVID-19)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Mortality: All Causes&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Mortality: COVID-19&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;85 and over (80+)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;13.45%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;14.8%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;75-84 (70-79)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4.39%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;65-74 (60-69)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1.78%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3.6%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;55-64 (50-59)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.89%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;1.3%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;45-54 (40-49)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.4%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.4%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;35-44 (30-39)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.19%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.2%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;25-34 (20-29)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.13%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.2%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;15-24 (10-19)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.07%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;.2%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Mortality rate converted from deaths per 100k in CDC report to a percentage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously the mortality rates aren&amp;#39;t directly transferrable, because not everyone will get COVID-19.

Using the reported mortality rates from Hubei compared to the leading causes and all causes of death by similar age groups in the United States, at a population infection rate exceeding 35% COVID-19 would become the leading cause of death for all age groups. At a .2% mortality rate (2 deaths per 1000 cases) and a 35% infection rate for children and young adults, COVID-19 would exceed the annual deaths for that age group for all other causes combined in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously the overall number of children and young adults that will get seriously ill and/or die remains very low relative to the numbers of older Americans likely to die in a broad pandemic. That said, the message being communicated to parents and youths is that younger people aren&amp;#39;t going to die from this virus, when the reality is that significant numbers of children and young adults may die compared to a non-pandemic year. In the worst case scenarios for infection rate (~70%), mortality rates for 10-24 year olds from COVID-19 could be double what you would see in a normal year for all causes combined (that wouldn&amp;#39;t mean there would be 200% more deaths, since excess mortality is more complicated than &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; deaths + pandemic deaths).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The mortality data from Hubei is a snapshot in time sourced from a preprint paper. It&amp;#39;s likely that there were a significant number of active infections that later resulted in death, as well as a number of asymptomatic infections that are not included in the overall case count. I have not found a better age-binned estimate of CFR, so if someone wants to point one out I&amp;#39;ll keep an eye on the comments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The number of cases for teens and younger adults was also relatively low, so there is probably a bias towards severe cases.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The relatively low number of cases for younger ages means any deaths have a large impact on the CFR.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Any CFR number while the pandemic/outbreak is underway is suspect.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The calculations are pretty simple, but it&amp;#39;s still possible I screwed up somewhere.
