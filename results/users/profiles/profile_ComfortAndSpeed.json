So I&amp;#39;m into chap 4 of python crash course book.  Plan is to finish up to chap 8 (functions) and then alternate with chapters of a recent webscraping with python book just to make things real.  I&amp;#39;m a tech PM and BA by trade and used to be a sysadmin so shouldn&amp;#39;t frighten easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have sprung up a wordpress blog site with a chatbot with basic RAG.  Goal is by the end of the year when gpt 5 and llama 4 hit know enough python to use the various LLMs to add features.  Even if it doesn&amp;#39;t turn into a side hustle might be able to make it into a portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically following the consistent advice  on this sub to just keep coding and try and make projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think folks - realistic?  Any better way?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
