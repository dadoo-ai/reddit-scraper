    "body": "It may not be straightforward. This is an answer to a question in the Guardian for someone looking to do the same thing. \n\nThe process for putting your home in your wife’s name only is relatively straightforward as you own the home outright. The first step is to get an official copy of the title from the Land Registry then fill in and sign Land Registry forms TR1 and AP1. If you decide to do all this yourself, rather than instruct a solicitor to do it for you, you’ll also need to complete form ID1 but, strangely, this has to be done by a solicitor. If there was a mortgage on the property, you cannot start the transfer process without your lender’s written permission.\nHowever, although the transfer process is relatively simple, there is no point going through with it. If, as I suspect, you think that making your wife sole owner of your current home means that you won’t have to pay the higher rate of land transaction tax (LTT) – the equivalent of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) in Wales – on your Welsh home, you’ve got another thing coming. For the purposes of property ownership, married couples (and civil partners) are treated as one unit. That means that if one spouse (or partner) already owns property, the purchase of another property by either of them is seen as being the purchase of an additional property for both of them and so the higher rates of LTT in Wales or SDLT in England and Northern Ireland apply.\n\nTransferring your current home to your wife’s sole name would make sense if your move to Wales will mean permanent separation from her. That’s because married couples (and civil partners) living separately in circumstances that are likely to be permanent, are treated as individuals rather than as one unit. Living separately while you wait for your wife to come round to your preferred location doesn’t count.\nOn a cheerier note, giving your share of your current home to your wife (which is essentially what you would be doing by putting it in her name only for no money) would not bring about a capital gains tax (CGT) bill. Disposals of assets between spouse or civil partners are CGT-free.",
