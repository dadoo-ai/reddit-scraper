I don&amp;#39;t know what to expect to see if it was actually making heat, but it seems it is not.  I am at 16 lbs but temp is ... under 60 (under the minimum for the guage)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in Fairfield, CT, seeking advice on local vendors that might come today. We will be in the 20&amp;#39;s tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, what should I plan to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Drip water from all fixtures, open cabinet doors under sinks?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Buy some electric heaters, put them in corners of the first floor and keep all doors open to circulate heat?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) What else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Temps are forecasted to be in the mid 20&amp;#39;s overnight and trying to reduce risk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The result is that most of the same logic is essentially cloned into the next form we create so its not too bad... until we get some kind of global directive that means we need to touch each form (like a business logic change)\n\nThe thought is to move the \"automation\" out of the form into a centralized automation, essentially making the form a kind of pass through of submitted data.   The question is WHERE the automation should reside.  \n\nOption 1 - Keep FA build the automation in Salesforce, so FA might create (in SF) a \"submission record\" and perhaps related child records and let a Salesforce automation chunk through it performing the automations as needed.  That allows some changes to be updated from the centralized automation (in Salesforce) vs each form.\n\nOption 2 - It seems Form Titan (FT) has an automation similar to flow (?) but we have no experience with it.   it seems we could have the FT form push data into an FA automation, which is connected to to update/create multiple records in SF.  \n\nWe have no experience with FT, and looking for input from people that have used both tools and could highlight the difference.   \n",

My son just moved to the Wooster St area and got Xfinity, where they supply you the \"box\" (wifi, router.. gateway perhaps?) and while we successfully connected it to the wall coax and were able to get WIFI and Wired internet, he is finding his smart TV is buffering even when hard wired.  He's heard (?) that their provided equipment is intentionally inferior to prompt you to upgrade service.\n\nJust wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience and found a solution, be it sourcing your own equipment (details please) or perhaps did some diagnosis yourself before calling Xfinity to make your case to get service improved (like checked speed test), and got some phone support from Xfinity).    Whenever I call my local provider they seem to be able to perform connectivity tests remotely, and even diagnose if they need to send someone out... to the house or the \"pole\" for an \"adjustment\".   (real or not).\n\nI'd like to know what we are up against...  (PS they all suck, but what is the path forward here within that reality)  \n\n\nEDIT/Update:  I am sharing this with him.  Hopefully its enough information to convince Xfinity CS to improve his connection or loose a brand new customer to Verizon or T-Mobile who both seem to have higher speed connections in the $30/mo range.",
