Yes, it‚Äôs cool to see someone skilled talk about bow hunting or building a kick ass shelter, but just like good hunting skills can be a winning strategy in this game, so is bulking up. \n\nI believe that Biko is no less deserving to be on this show just because he took a different approach on how to play the game.

    "body": "Race: Ironman Maryland \n\nDate: Sept 28th 2019\n\nDistance: 140.6\n\nStats: 10% DNF rate, 20 min slower average times \n\n\nThis was my second time finishing this course, third time racing it. This race is set in a small town that is so welcoming and receptive of Ironman and it feels more like an independent tri vs an IM branded event. \n\nThursday: \nArrived, did the check in, practice swim and a quick bike with Lindsey. The jelly fish were especially bad in the swim practice area and people were having panic attacks before the race even started! \nThen after that I went to the opening ceremony which I left early because I was so exhausted, I ended up getting 11 hours of sleep that night. \n\nFriday: \nChecked in my bike and my gear bags and then did my volunteer shift for bib-mailing athletes. I was doing this race solo, and even though I had plenty of friends racing with me, volunteering took my mind off the race and gave me something to do. Side note: it‚Äôs mind boggling how many people don‚Äôt read the athlete guide ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. \nMet up with Hilary after dinner for a quick drink and then off to bed!\n\nRace Day:\nGot to transition at around 5:15am, checked over my bike and my gear bags. Found Lindsey (it was her first IM and we trained together basically the whole summer) we put on our wetsuits and slathered in Sea Safe and Vaseline (spoiler: they didn‚Äôt do shit) and lined up in our swim waves. I think this training season I‚Äôve only swam a handful of times, but they were all open water, and some of them with jellyfish. \nI knew what to expect from the stings. \nThe tide was going out during our swim, pulling lots of people all over the place. First loop took me longer than I expected between the jellies and my goggles getting water in them. Thankfully there was cloud cover so at least I didn‚Äôt have the sun in my eyes. The second loop, holy shit, so many jellies. I didn‚Äôt mind getting stung on my arms and feet, but a couple got me really good in the face. Quite a few people dropped out at the swim due to severe allergic reactions. \n\nSwim time: 1:50, right on the nose. \n\nI was elated to see Hilary in T1. She got me vinegar for my face, I got on all my bike gear, drank a v8, and off I went! \n\nBike: \nI spent pretty much my whole summer riding this course. I knew what to expect from the wind, and non-stop pedaling. \nI didn‚Äôt use my watch for the bike and just went by feel. And boy was it amazing, I got out of the water ranked in 1700‚Äôs I got off the bike ranked in 1020‚Äôs. \nI fueled with Gatorade, tailwind, and goldfish for the first half, and Gatorade, ucan, and a turkey sandwich on the second half. \nThis course goes through the nature refuge which is very pretty, I saw two bald eagles and not much else because I stayed aero to avoid getting blown over. It is a fast course, but lots of people underestimate the fact that flat courses don‚Äôt give you the opportunity to cruise or use down hills to gain speed. You literally pedal for 112 miles. I did get held up by a truck at one point, and a couple of times athletes didn‚Äôt move left when I announced my passing so I had to drop and wait for a safer spot to pass. \nAside from the wind, weather was perfect, we did get rained on at mile 80-90 which felt so refreshing. \n\nBike Time: 6:33 (15 minute PR, fuck yeah!)\n\nMy goal was to get out on the run course before 4pm. Again, so excited to see Hilary in T2, her and everyone else in the changing tents were amazing. It‚Äôs a tough, stinky job to do! Lindsey got to T2 shortly after me and I was so stoked for how well she was doing!! We left T2 at 3:50pm. As I was leaving the changing tent, I saw my friends Gina and Rebekah who drove all the way from Philly just to cheer me on!!! It was so awesome!\n\nRun: \nOh my god. It felt like the surface of the sun. My goal was to keep the HR down and keep moving, I quickly realized that won‚Äôt be feasible in this heat so I took it easy, took salts, poured water on myself (and consequently my shoes, more on that later) and stuffed ice in my bra. I wanted to wait until the sun started setting to kick it in high gear so I wouldn‚Äôt overheat. \nThe run course is a 2.5 loop, the first two turn arounds are in this cul-de-sac in the middle of an empty field, it is honestly soul crushing to do that segment and it tests your mental strength more than physical. \nEveryone was struggling on the run, between all the tris and marathons I‚Äôve done, I‚Äôve never seen this many people throwing up on the side of the road or just laying down. I saw about 5 medic cars go by me in the first 10 miles. \nOnce the sun finally set, I started to pick up pace and hustle. I was still pretty hot so I sucked on ice cubes and poured water on my head at every aid station. I saw so many of my friends from doing IMMD the previous year and all my first timer friends I made while training this summer that it made the run feel less miserable. \nI knew that my marathon time was looking pretty bad so I tried to pick up my pace as much as I could, but I just couldn‚Äôt make up for the slower time I had in the first half. \nI was really surprised at how many athletes were still out on the course as well, this heat was no joke and I don‚Äôt think anyone was ready for it. For a historically fast race, women‚Äôs top AG times only had 2 sub-10 finishes!\n \nNow back to my wet shoes, I had huge blisters forming on the balls of my feet, and at about 3 miles away from the finish line I felt them bust. I would rather get stung in the face by a jelly fish again than to walk on busted blisters. \nThese are also the times when I realize that Ironman is so much more than just a physical feat, I had to be so mentally strong during those last few miles, in the dark, in pain, with little time left. By 10:40 I was making my last turn into the finisher chute. I was very surprised to see some aid stations already packed up, especially this close to the finish line. I will say that as welcome as Cambridge is, IMMD still has a lot of work in terms of finish line feels, if you‚Äôre a late finisher, don‚Äôt expect a crowd. \nWith that aside, I waited for the handful of people in front of me to have the red carpet, gathered everything I had in me, and ran...oh my god that hurt so bad, but I still smiled! \nTotal time: 15:45...not my best work due to the run, but it was a very slow day for everyone. \n\nLindsey finished right after me and it was sooo good to see her cross that finish line!!! I ended up in the medical tent with my blisters (again, Hilary is a saint for toting all my shit around and basically taking care of me because I couldn‚Äôt put any weight on the balls of my feet). \n\nOther than the blisters, this has been the best I have ever felt post-race.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Race: Ironman Maryland &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Date: Sept 28th 2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Distance: 140.6&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stats: 10% DNF rate, 20 min slower average times &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my second time finishing this course, third time racing it. This race is set in a small town that is so welcoming and receptive of Ironman and it feels more like an independent tri vs an IM branded event. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thursday: \nArrived, did the check in, practice swim and a quick bike with Lindsey. The jelly fish were especially bad in the swim practice area and people were having panic attacks before the race even started! \nThen after that I went to the opening ceremony which I left early because I was so exhausted, I ended up getting 11 hours of sleep that night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday: \nChecked in my bike and my gear bags and then did my volunteer shift for bib-mailing athletes. I was doing this race solo, and even though I had plenty of friends racing with me, volunteering took my mind off the race and gave me something to do. Side note: it‚Äôs mind boggling how many people don‚Äôt read the athlete guide ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. \nMet up with Hilary after dinner for a quick drink and then off to bed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Race Day:\nGot to transition at around 5:15am, checked over my bike and my gear bags. Found Lindsey (it was her first IM and we trained together basically the whole summer) we put on our wetsuits and slathered in Sea Safe and Vaseline (spoiler: they didn‚Äôt do shit) and lined up in our swim waves. I think this training season I‚Äôve only swam a handful of times, but they were all open water, and some of them with jellyfish. \nI knew what to expect from the stings. \nThe tide was going out during our swim, pulling lots of people all over the place. First loop took me longer than I expected between the jellies and my goggles getting water in them. Thankfully there was cloud cover so at least I didn‚Äôt have the sun in my eyes. The second loop, holy shit, so many jellies. I didn‚Äôt mind getting stung on my arms and feet, but a couple got me really good in the face. Quite a few people dropped out at the swim due to severe allergic reactions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Swim time: 1:50, right on the nose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was elated to see Hilary in T1. She got me vinegar for my face, I got on all my bike gear, drank a v8, and off I went! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bike: \nI spent pretty much my whole summer riding this course. I knew what to expect from the wind, and non-stop pedaling. \nI didn‚Äôt use my watch for the bike and just went by feel. And boy was it amazing, I got out of the water ranked in 1700‚Äôs I got off the bike ranked in 1020‚Äôs. \nI fueled with Gatorade, tailwind, and goldfish for the first half, and Gatorade, ucan, and a turkey sandwich on the second half. \nThis course goes through the nature refuge which is very pretty, I saw two bald eagles and not much else because I stayed aero to avoid getting blown over. It is a fast course, but lots of people underestimate the fact that flat courses don‚Äôt give you the opportunity to cruise or use down hills to gain speed. You literally pedal for 112 miles. I did get held up by a truck at one point, and a couple of times athletes didn‚Äôt move left when I announced my passing so I had to drop and wait for a safer spot to pass. \nAside from the wind, weather was perfect, we did get rained on at mile 80-90 which felt so refreshing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bike Time: 6:33 (15 minute PR, fuck yeah!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goal was to get out on the run course before 4pm. Again, so excited to see Hilary in T2, her and everyone else in the changing tents were amazing. It‚Äôs a tough, stinky job to do! Lindsey got to T2 shortly after me and I was so stoked for how well she was doing!! We left T2 at 3:50pm. As I was leaving the changing tent, I saw my friends Gina and Rebekah who drove all the way from Philly just to cheer me on!!! It was so awesome!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run: \nOh my god. It felt like the surface of the sun. My goal was to keep the HR down and keep moving, I quickly realized that won‚Äôt be feasible in this heat so I took it easy, took salts, poured water on myself (and consequently my shoes, more on that later) and stuffed ice in my bra. I wanted to wait until the sun started setting to kick it in high gear so I wouldn‚Äôt overheat. \nThe run course is a 2.5 loop, the first two turn arounds are in this cul-de-sac in the middle of an empty field, it is honestly soul crushing to do that segment and it tests your mental strength more than physical. \nEveryone was struggling on the run, between all the tris and marathons I‚Äôve done, I‚Äôve never seen this many people throwing up on the side of the road or just laying down. I saw about 5 medic cars go by me in the first 10 miles. \nOnce the sun finally set, I started to pick up pace and hustle. I was still pretty hot so I sucked on ice cubes and poured water on my head at every aid station. I saw so many of my friends from doing IMMD the previous year and all my first timer friends I made while training this summer that it made the run feel less miserable. \nI knew that my marathon time was looking pretty bad so I tried to pick up my pace as much as I could, but I just couldn‚Äôt make up for the slower time I had in the first half. \nI was really surprised at how many athletes were still out on the course as well, this heat was no joke and I don‚Äôt think anyone was ready for it. For a historically fast race, women‚Äôs top AG times only had 2 sub-10 finishes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now back to my wet shoes, I had huge blisters forming on the balls of my feet, and at about 3 miles away from the finish line I felt them bust. I would rather get stung in the face by a jelly fish again than to walk on busted blisters. \nThese are also the times when I realize that Ironman is so much more than just a physical feat, I had to be so mentally strong during those last few miles, in the dark, in pain, with little time left. By 10:40 I was making my last turn into the finisher chute. I was very surprised to see some aid stations already packed up, especially this close to the finish line. I will say that as welcome as Cambridge is, IMMD still has a lot of work in terms of finish line feels, if you‚Äôre a late finisher, don‚Äôt expect a crowd. \nWith that aside, I waited for the handful of people in front of me to have the red carpet, gathered everything I had in me, and ran...oh my god that hurt so bad, but I still smiled! \nTotal time: 15:45...not my best work due to the run, but it was a very slow day for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lindsey finished right after me and it was sooo good to see her cross that finish line!!! I ended up in the medical tent with my blisters (again, Hilary is a saint for toting all my shit around and basically taking care of me because I couldn‚Äôt put any weight on the balls of my feet). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than the blisters, this has been the best I have ever felt post-race. I‚Äôm not overly sore, the roof of my mouth doesn‚Äôt hurt (I kept on reminding myself to breathe through my nose more to avoid that), and I‚Äôm still very hydrated! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will I do IMMD next year? Probably not, but I think it‚Äôs a great race for anyone new to the sport, and I will definitely be coming back to Cambridge to ride and swim, it will forever hold a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Being broke at the time and wanting to save on tolls, we decided to take the toll free route which would land us in Philly in about 10 hours. \n\nOriginally we were going to leave my parents place early, but we got distracted and didn‚Äôt leave until about 4pm. Not a big deal, I‚Äôve driven from Chicago to California, hiked parts of PCT and AT by myself.

Sure enough, he found one. Being busy driving I didn‚Äôt bother to look at what his GPS showed and just followed his directions. \n\nI thought it was weird that the GPS told us to get off the highway since normally these vistas are located right on the highway, similar to a rest stop. Whatever, we take the exit and turn down this dimly lit road and leads us up a smaller mountain base. I find it really strange that there aren‚Äôt any other cars around. I did see a rusty sign for a scenic look-out, and it pointed us down what looked like a service road. The road itself wasn‚Äôt paved, and the only other road leading off it was gated off. Both of us got a very weird feeling, I turned off the music because it was so creepy quiet and my radio now sounded like I was blasting it from concert speakers. We could hear every leaf my car was crunching under its tires. \n\nAfter going may be half a mile down this road, we got way too spooked, said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and I went to make a 3 point turn to get out of there. \nAt this point the hair on the back of my neck is standing up. We drove may be 50ft before we saw a tree laying across the road we just drove on. Me turning around may be took 2 minutes, and as I mentioned earlier, things were so quiet that we both knew we would‚Äôve heard a tree fall down behind us. \n\nPanic started to take over and something told me we can‚Äôt just sit there and think long and hard about what to do. So my boyfriend said he would see if he can lift one side of the tree and move it over. I had my brights on and was scanning the surrounding woods for any signs of movement, I felt eyes on us, but couldn‚Äôt see anything. The tree didn‚Äôt appear to be old, it literally as if someone knocked it over just in front of us. \n\nAs soon as my bf was out of the car, the first thing I did was tell him I loved him and then locked the doors. I know, I‚Äôm an asshole. \nThankfully he was able to move the tree just enough for my car to squeeze through and as soon as he was back in the car we gunned it out of there. \n\nI‚Äôm a very spiritual person and believe that there are things in the woods that we don‚Äôt always see. My bf on the other hand, is an atheist. That night we both agreed that something sinister was out there.",

Whatever, we take the exit and turn down this dimly lit road and leads us up a smaller mountain base. I find it really strange that there aren‚Äôt any other cars around. I did see a rusty sign for a scenic look-out, and it pointed us down what looked like a service road. The road itself wasn‚Äôt paved, and the only other road leading off it was gated off. Both of us got a very weird feeling, I turned off the music because it was so creepy quiet and my radio now sounded like I was blasting it from concert speakers. We could hear every leaf my car was crunching under its tires. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After going may be half a mile down this road, we got way too spooked, said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and I went to make a 3 point turn to get out of there. \nAt this point the hair on the back of my neck is standing up. We drove may be 50ft before we saw a tree laying across the road we just drove on. Me turning around may be took 2 minutes, and as I mentioned earlier, things were so quiet that we both knew we would‚Äôve heard a tree fall down behind us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Panic started to take over and something told me we can‚Äôt just sit there and think long and hard about what to do. So my boyfriend said he would see if he can lift one side of the tree and move it over. I had my brights on and was scanning the surrounding woods for any signs of movement, I felt eyes on us, but couldn‚Äôt see anything. The tree didn‚Äôt appear to be old, it literally as if someone knocked it over just in front of us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as my bf was out of the car, the first thing I did was tell him I loved him and then locked the doors. I know, I‚Äôm an asshole. \nThankfully he was able to move the tree just enough for my car to squeeze through and as soon as he was back in the car we gunned it out of there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a very spiritual person and believe that there are things in the woods that we don‚Äôt always see. My bf on the other hand, is an atheist. That night we both agreed that something sinister was out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "Hey guys! \nSo happy I found this sub! Our baby Brenna is an angel at home, but such a nightmare on a leash. She's been given up twice before I adopted her. First time due to \"landlord issues\" and second time because she was attacked by another dog in her new home. \nShe is pretty good off the leash, but is very selective with people. She wants to be given space and will start lunging and barking at anyone who tries to talk to us too much or stands on a higher ground than me. However with slow introduction she will warm up to people and become a cuddly love bug. \n\nAttaching a picture album at the end because duh, she's adorable.\n\n\nWhat kind of breed is your dog and approximately how much do they weigh?\n- Brenna is a purebred GSD. The vet clocked her in at 68.5lbs yesterday\n\nHow old is your dog now?\n- 5 years and 2 months\n\nHow long have you had your dog?\n- 8 months \n\nHow old was your dog when you noticed their reactivity?\n- 4 years old\n\nWhat is your dog's energy level?\n- Hard to pin-point this one. She can spend the entire day playing ball, but when I'm feeling chill, she can spend the whole days sleeping. \n\nHas your dog bitten anyone? If they have, how often and how severely?\n- She snapped at my roommate (before we moved out). Brenna was laying in the love seat and my roommate sat down on the arm of the seat which prompted Brenna to lunge at her. Thankfully I reacted quickly and it was just a small puncture wound.\n\nHow much physical and mental exercise do you do with your dog?\n- At the least we spend 2 hours a day playing. She loves playing fetch and doing nose work. We've also recently bought her one of those treat dispensing toys. We live in an apartment building and it's hard to take her out due to her leash aggression, so we spend a lot of time chasing balls around our living room and bedroom. \n\nHas your dog been with you through major life changes? Things like moving, having kids, getting another dog, etc.\n- moving \n\nWhat type of area do you live in currently? Suburbs, urban, countryside? If you're comfortable, you can share the nearest metro area and we may be able to recommend specific trainers/behaviorists.\n- We live in Philadelphia near the Art Museum\n\nWhat things does your dog do when reacting? (jump, bark, lunge, stare, whine, etc.) Check out ispeakdog.com for wonderful examples of behavior.\n- lunge, bark, jump, hackles will go up. \n\nWhat triggers a reaction? Men, women, kids, dogs, birds, and so on.\n- Busess, cars, other dogs (when leashed), people (when leashed or together in confined space), anyone entering our home, squirrels, birds, when people are standing higher than we are (if i'm sitting down and someone who's talking to me is standing up). She also seems to HATE color purple, she freaks out way more when she sees a purple bus or if someone has purple hair. \n\nDo they react the same everywhere or do they only react in certain locations?\n- she is not reactive at the dog park, she'll still bark at busses/other dogs if she can see them from our window. \n\nDoes your dog react the same to their triggers on leash versus off leash? If they react on leash, do they redirect onto you or the leash?\n- she's great with dogs off leash, pretty much ignores them like a typical GSD. She seems to be picky with her humans, if we are at a neutral location and new people give her space and treats she will warm up to them, for example: when I brought her over to my parents house (they have a GSD and a Westie) she was OK with my mom, took treats from her and didn't pay any attention to her, when my mom went to pet her later in the day, she lunged at her. My mom continued to give her food and treats, but didn't try to smother her and gave her space, now Brenna will snuggle with mom whenever she goes home. My parents GSD will bark at her until his voice gives out whenever we get home, Brenna will just look at him, look at me, and then go about her business like she can't even hear him, it doesn't seem to bother her one bit. \n\nDoes your dog react to their triggers behind a barrier? (Like a window or a fence)\n- Yes\n\nWhat's their threshold distance? Can they see any of their triggers at a distance and not react?\n- she will bark at a bus a mile away, cars and dogs...about 50ft\n\nWhat sort of training, if any, have you done so far? This includes counter conditioning, BAT, Look at That game, and many others.\n- when we hired a behaviorist to observe her, she suggested we counter condition/distract her when a trigger is present. Right now we make her go down and feed her high value treats as soon as we see a trigger until it is out of sight. She's been pretty responsive to this, but if one little thing sets her off, she will lose focus for most of the walk.\n\nIs your dog on any medications for their reactivity? Is this something you would consider?\n- we got Clomicalm and trazodone rxed yesterday.\n\nHow much time will/can you commit to helping your dog work through reactivity?\n- as much as it takes. Between my boyfriend and I, the longest she is alone is about 3 hours. We will work with her whenever we are with her.\n\nWhat sort of equipment do you have? Leashes, collars, harnesses, muzzles, etc. We generally do not recommend aversives on fearful or aggressive dogs because it can make the reactivity worse.\n- we've got an easy walk harness and a collar (the harness sometimes comes undone), a leash sleeve that says \"i need space\", a leather muzzle which she honestly doesn't mind at all, she is not more or less reactive with it on, we only put it on her when we take her down in the elevator to avoid any accidents. She also wears booties when it's hot/snowing and doesn't mind those either. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/Pvte4",

Between my boyfriend and I, the longest she is alone is about 3 hours. We will work with her whenever we are with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What sort of equipment do you have? Leashes, collars, harnesses, muzzles, etc. We generally do not recommend aversives on fearful or aggressive dogs because it can make the reactivity worse.\n- we&amp;#39;ve got an easy walk harness and a collar (the harness sometimes comes undone), a leash sleeve that says &amp;quot;i need space&amp;quot;, a leather muzzle which she honestly doesn&amp;#39;t mind at all, she is not more or less reactive with it on, we only put it on her when we take her down in the elevator to avoid any accidents. She also wears booties when it&amp;#39;s hot/snowing and doesn&amp;#39;t mind those either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/Pvte4\"&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/Pvte4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
