There is no direct communication with your artist before your appointment. It was a cover-up (which I know isn't an artist's fav) so I sent in photos of the piece and what I'd like to cover it.  I offered to stop in so the artist could see it and get a sense for placement, saturation, etc. I am told that's not the process. The coordinator submits this to the artist to see if it's something they want to do. (totally fair and appreciated!) I don't hear back from the coordinator until I reach out 2 weeks later. In my case, the artist accepted it. All of the instructions indicated I would be contacted if there were any questions on placement, design, etc - which is all fine.\n\nI don't hear anything before the appointment. I take a half day off work and do my normal pre-session routine. I arrive and am met by the artist (who is also the owner) who tells me she began working on the design late last night and didn't feel confident she would be a good fit. Instead of reaching out, she decided to keep the appt but would not be tattooing me. I am then shuffled to another artist who seems less than thrilled at doing the work and doesn't have any availability until mid-May.

They've started monitoring badge swipes (biiig fucking ick, btw) and my manager reached out to say that my name was flagged and I needed to 'get off the list'. This is fine by me, but I don't know if I can do it long term. They offered me a 6 figure retention bonus, paid in 2 installments. One at TOB and another if I stayed for a year post TOB.

Highlight their ideas, give them credit and try to get them a seat at the table. \n\n2. If you notice a colleague talking over them or if you notice that their ideas are being repeated by a dude, call it out. I usually say 'oh yeah, Katie just said that' or 'Katie was just explaining to me...' and ask her to continue. A LOT of women have trouble speaking up in spaces that are male dominated - help them if you can. \n\n  \n3. Network and befriend women of integrity in your company. I have several professional and personal mentors and nearly all of them are women. Find leaders that you admire! \n\n  \n4. GAS WOMEN UP! I am being so for real on this one. I will gas a woman up until SHE feels she can do anything. There's a shift that happens when you not only show others how to be heard, seen, promoted - but you become their biggest cheerleader. Women need to know that it's perfectly acceptable and OK to take up space and for the love of god, DO NOT ACCEPT A FIRST OFFER. Asking for what you deserve is not rude and 99.9999% of the time, you will not get a job offer rescinded bc you asked for more money or a more flexible work schedule. \n\n5. This SEEMs very minuscule, but offering advice on communication can be an incredibly helpful tool that doesn't hit most people don't consider. Women are socialized to be more 'pleasant' and 'non-threatening' in our communications - partly bc it was a survival tactic. Some things I do now that I def didn't do when my career was just starting: \n\n\\- I don't use emojis in my emails unless it's someone familiar to me \n\n\\- I don't use colors or extra fonts even though my personality is very loud and colorful \n\n\\- I limit exclamation points\n\n\\- I try not to 'pad' what I'm saying. If I need someone on my team to do something. Ex:\n\n\"Hey, could you update that list for me today? If not, no worries!\" . Instead I would say \"hey, i need this done by EOD. Can you get to it?\"\n\n&lt;endrant&gt;",
