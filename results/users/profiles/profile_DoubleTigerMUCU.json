    "body": "Preface: I had a celebratory drink or five. \n\nAbout 4 months ago I leapt and left my career in finance I didn't know what my next career would look like, I just knew I didn't love the direction it was headed. I needed to find anew direction.\n\nI started buying beers for friends that loved what they did. I asked why they loved it and how they came to love their careers. Eventually I broke it down to a few questions:\n- what types of problems do you like to solve: Technical? Difficult customers? Physically demanding? Something else?\n- how do you want to interact with people? Constantly? Occasionally? Zero?\n- what feels emotionally \"light\" when you're working on it? It's easy to identify what feels \"heavy\", it's the task or job that drains you and you get home and lay on the couch at the end of the day. What's the opposite of \"heavy\" for you?\n\nI answered all of those questions and started hearing about the Salesforce platform. I dove in. I'm now a \"Ranger\" on Trailhead. \n\nI started networking my tail off. You have a friend whose cousin once worked in Salesforce? Great can I meet them for a quick meeting on Zoom? Oh, your cat's uncle's owner worked at Salesforce, can you connect us?\n\nI just kept tabs on everyone that was in the ecosystem. I listened to the SF Admins podcast. I emailed guests that were on the show to chat them up. \n\nPeople want to help. Everyone needs it and everyone has been on the other side at some point.\n\nToday I had a final interview with Salesforce and received a verbal offer.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface: I had a celebratory drink or five. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 4 months ago I leapt and left my career in finance I didn&amp;#39;t know what my next career would look like, I just knew I didn&amp;#39;t love the direction it was headed. I needed to find anew direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started buying beers for friends that loved what they did. I asked why they loved it and how they came to love their careers. Eventually I broke it down to a few questions:\n- what types of problems do you like to solve: Technical? Difficult customers? Physically demanding? Something else?\n- how do you want to interact with people? Constantly? Occasionally? Zero?\n- what feels emotionally &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; when you&amp;#39;re working on it? It&amp;#39;s easy to identify what feels &amp;quot;heavy&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s the task or job that drains you and you get home and lay on the couch at the end of the day. What&amp;#39;s the opposite of &amp;quot;heavy&amp;quot; for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I answered all of those questions and started hearing about the Salesforce platform. I dove in. I&amp;#39;m now a &amp;quot;Ranger&amp;quot; on Trailhead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started networking my tail off. You have a friend whose cousin once worked in Salesforce? Great can I meet them for a quick meeting on Zoom? Oh, your cat&amp;#39;s uncle&amp;#39;s owner worked at Salesforce, can you connect us?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just kept tabs on everyone that was in the ecosystem. I listened to the SF Admins podcast. I emailed guests that were on the show to chat them up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People want to help. Everyone needs it and everyone has been on the other side at some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I had a final interview with Salesforce and received a verbal offer.
