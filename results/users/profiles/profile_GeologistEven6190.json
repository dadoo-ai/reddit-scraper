    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you underestimate yourself on the academic front. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t write like an idiot and can clearly think through things. If you want to get qualifications like NCEA you can go to university and do remedial courses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think this is a passion issue. I think this is a confidence and mental health issue which is presenting itself as a passion issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is actually go to University to get the remedial courses done. Prove to yourself you have the skills to do something academically, this will give you confidence and more options. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there starting a trade isn&amp;#39;t a bad idea because at least if you drop out you are getting paid. Passion comes from mastery by the way, once you are really good at something you will like it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
