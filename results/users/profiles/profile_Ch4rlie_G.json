    "parsedCommunityName": "jetski",
    "body": "Now that I have owned my two sparks (2up 90HP with IBR and 2UP Trixx) for a while and put some hours into them, I want to address most of the commonly asked questions about Sparks in just one post. I know there are YouTube videos, but here is my Google-able, text format version of \"Should you buy a Spark?\"\n\nThis is a long post, so here is a ChatGPT-style tl;dr...\n\nPlus side: Sparks are the cheapest way to get a modern 4-stroke PWC that is reliable. Sparks are also half the weight of other PWCs. This makes them extremely nimble and fun, with a side benefit of fuel economy that is 2x-10x better than other PWCs.\n\nMinus Side: Sparks have very little storage, which makes them difficult if you have long outings. Their lightweight comes with many penalties: small seats, more difficulty towing riders, reduced stability, and much harsher ride than other PWCs. Sparks also have a top speed of only 48MPH which may or may not be a negative for you.\n\n**People buy sparks for a few reasons:**\n\n1. They are cheap\n2. They have the lowest fuel consumption of any ski on the market (by a wide margin)\n   1. A spark burns 2.4 GPH (3.3 hours of riding) at full speed, the closest competitor is the Yamaha EX at 7.9 GPH (1.7 Hours of Riding). And as you go up in size and horsepower this gets worse. Stats are from [JetDrift.com](http://JetDrift.com) but unfortunately jetdrift only tested the flagship models at best cruising speed instead of full speed which could make a huge difference.\n   2. Tidbit: A Sea-Doo 300HP RXT will burn 25GPH at 70MPH!\n3. They want something fun to throw around and don't ride long distances.\n   1. The largest 3-up Spark weighs only 439 lbs Dry, with the 2-up about 405 lbs. They are incredibly agile and easy to throw around. They will launch into the air in even small waves if you command them to. The next step in the Sea-doo Line is the GTI 170 at a whopping 739 lbs dry. Bigger skis with bigger engines mean reduced fuel economy, so they carry more fuel; making the wet weight of any \"non-Spark\" PWC almost double the weight of a Spark. This will adversely affect handling no matter what a Redditor tells you.\n   2. Example: My neighbors at the lake all have supercharged Sea-Doos and Yamahas, we often switch back and forth and try each other's PWCs. Kids and young adults always come to my place to borrow my sparks unless towing. The older adults tend towards the fast, stable, and comfy cruisers. 30 and 40-somethings choose based on what they are in the mood for.\n   3. IMO the spark is the most fun you can have on the water and I've ridden most of the PWCs out there. But not everyone is riding just for fun. There are times I will grab a neighbor's speed demon or three-seater to tow something, take a long ride, take an older person or kid on a ride, rip it at 70 MPH, or when it's wavy.\n4. They want a ski that feels just like a PWC they rode in the 90s, but with modern-day reliability and no need to add oil and mess with carbs (this was me).\n   1. I could have easily afforded top-of-the-line PWCs, but I live on a lake that's only 2,000 acres-ish and wanted something just for fun. I do my cruising on the pontoon or my wakeboard boat.\n5. People like the look of them (granted they are unique looking and not everyone likes it).\n6. They have a vehicle with very low towing capacity.\n7. They want to do wheelies. It seems silly but multiple people have mentioned this as a reason for purchase.\n   1. Note that only the Trixx model does wheelies. However, you can upgrade any Spark with IBR (brakes, neutral &amp; reverse) to do wheelies like the Trixx.\n\n**Conversely, there are great reasons not to buy a spark:**\n\n1. They use the ski on big water with large waves, or have long distances to travel\n2. They will do a lot of towing of riders (tubes, skis, wakeboards).\n   1. They will do it but the stability with 2 or 3 riders is subpar, the lightweight makes it get dragged by the rope and it could use more power for larger riders.\n   2. Most people say the 2-up is really a 1-up (and the 2024s are now marketed that way), and the 3-up is a 2-up. Compare the 3-up seat to a 3-seat seadoo or Yamaha. The seat area will be twice as large, and twice as padded on the non-Sparks.\n3. They want a stable ski or are a heavier person.\n   1. They get tipper the more you weigh over about 200 pounds. I am 180 lbs and don't find them tippy solo, but toss my 115-pound wife on the back and they get noticeably tippier. If you and a rider are 400 lbs or more, you must actively balance the ski at idle and slower speeds. You will also have to be VERY careful in sharper turns.\n   2. Unfortunately, this doesn't improve with the 3-up. The 3-up is the same hull with an extended deck and seat.\n4. They need a lot of storage for long days on the water.\n   1. Even with the optional front storage bin Sparks have a hilariously small amount of storage. The only standard storage is a glove box that can only fit a phone, wallet, and keys.  Neither option is waterproof, but in laid-back riding, they won't get wet.\n   2. Seadoo has a Linq system that can add a small cooler, storage box, fuel, or other items to the back. But only one of those things at a time\n5. They do a lot of DIY work and don't want to take off the top hull to do engine work.\n   1. Honestly, this is a real PITA. Knock on wood I have only had to do this once a season to winterize (so far). You can check fluids, top off fluids, and charge and change your battery without taking the hull off, but that's about it. I haven't tried changing plugs with the top on.\n   2. Example: one of my skis is slowly losing coolant, it top-offs every month. I am 99% sure it's a leak, but a diagnosis would require splitting the ski. You can split a ski on a lift, but it's better on a trailer, so that's yet another advantage if you keep your ski on a lake with a lift.\n6. Fishing. There isn't space for gear and it's very tippy standing on the back platform.\n7. Speed\n   1. A lot of folks want the fastest thing on the water. The Spark being on the low end of PWC top speeds could be seen as an overall negative, possibly even lowering resale value. Note that it's not the slowest PWC out there\n8. The Construction\n   1. The plastic+fiberglass material they are made out of can't be buffed and polished like fiberglass can. Sparks are the only model of PWC that uses this type of hull construction.\n   2. It's difficult to repair Sparks in comparison to other PWCs. Damaging your hull by hitting a log, rock, dock, or another boat you might have to replace the entire hull.\n   3. There are some reports of hull cracking in extreme chop. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen. Make sure to check the Torx screws that connect the hull to the top deck periodically with a torque wrench that can be set as low as 4.5 nm/\n\n**The common debate. \"Is the spark fast enough?\" Also some tuning tips.**\n\n\"Sparks are too slow, you will get bored with it and want to upgrade\". Then the response \"You can tune it to 120HP super easily\".\n\ntl;dr: This is a personal decision with no right answer. How fast is fast enough for you?\n\n1. You could also easily get bored with only top speed and less maneuverability. Non-Sparks will be harder to spin, slide, wave jump, and wheelie. On small bodies of water, the 48MPH top speed is still pretty fast, and far faster than most boats on inland lakes.\n2. Yes you can easily tune a spark to 110hp on 91+ octane or even more on E85 gas. The 110HP tune is generally considered safe and many people have done it and put plenty of trouble-free hours on their skis. You can buy tuner equipment or mail in your ECU to be flashed.\n3. No tune will make you go 60+ MPH, due to the hull shape the highest HP tune will only get you to 53MPH which is a 5MPH increase over the stock top speed (pretty minimal).\n4. Any tune will make you accelerate MUCH faster, which should be your primary reason for doing it. Add a Solas impeller for even more hole-shot.\n5. If you race away from red lights in your car or like to floor it on the water anytime a boat is beside you, a spark is not for you!\n\n**Helpful Spark Tips:**\n\n1. Buy the 90HP IBR model or the Trixx unless you know 100% what you are missing.\n   1. 60HP is a huge decrease and IBR is amazing even if you don't think you will use it much. The IBR option has brakes and includes variable trim, which helps with a rider or in chop.\n   2. If you have a 60HP model you can flash the ECU to 90hp, there are no actual engine differences. You can't easily add IBR to a non-IBR ski though.\n2. If you are trailering and don't have a place on a body of water a Spark likely isn't the right choice based on storage space alone. The exception would be if you had Linq storage installed\n   1. Even if you are fine with the rough ride in exchange for giggles, the lack of storage might limit you.\n   2. If I am going out on a body of water supported only by what is in my ski and my car I would still want a cooler for food and hydration, basic tools, a phone charger, a good first aid kit, an anchor or sand stake, sunscreen, a hoodie/raincoat, plus my wallet and keys at the very least.\n3. The Spark does have an optional emergency kit that tucks away in a waterproof container in the hull (behind the kneepad). It's very cheap and recommended.\n4. You can convert any IBR-equipped spark to a Trixx by installing \"Extended VTS\"\n   1. You can buy the Trixx parts directly from Seadoo and toss them on any IBR spark to wheelie. I did that with my regular 90HP 2-up and it's not overly expensive\n   2. If you want to do wheelies, but don't want the rest of the stuff you can do that too. Trixx handlebars, handlebar wiring harness and footpads would run you an extra $550 last I checked, but you don't need them to wheelie. I did it on the regular Spark I have and I like it. It stops the kids from fighting over the Trixx. I also like the understated Styling more than the Trixx styling.\n5. Get the front storage bin, you will thank me later. It's an easy DIY to add as well if you buy used.\n6. If you are on the fence, ride one!\n   1. If your dealer doesn't do test rides, drive to another one. If you are considering used, ask the seller if you can take a test ride. Tell them you are on the fence, but if you don't buy it you will give them $50 or $100 for their trouble. They might take you up on it.\n7. **\\*\\*\\* IMPORTANT WARNING ABOUT BUYING USED \\*\\*\\***\n   1. Sparks built from 2014 to the middle of 2016 had a \"design inneficiency\" with the PTO shaft, search for Sea Doo Spark PTO Problems. If you get a failure, you need to a lot more work than with a Ski made after 2016. Like a lot more ($$$$).\n   2. Unless you are getting an absolute steal I would search 2017 or newer. The small increase in price is worth some peace of mind that if something fails in the driveline, you can fix the driveline without tons of additional work.\n   3. I have no idea how you would check the build date of a 2016 Spark.\n\nFor those who read this far, what did I miss or get wrong? Has anyone gone to or from a Spark from another PWC? If so, let us know how it went.",
    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I have owned my two sparks (2up 90HP with IBR and 2UP Trixx) for a while and put some hours into them, I want to address most of the commonly asked questions about Sparks in just one post. I know there are YouTube videos, but here is my Google-able, text format version of &amp;quot;Should you buy a Spark?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a long post, so here is a ChatGPT-style tl;dr...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus side: Sparks are the cheapest way to get a modern 4-stroke PWC that is reliable. Sparks are also half the weight of other PWCs. This makes them extremely nimble and fun, with a side benefit of fuel economy that is 2x-10x better than other PWCs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minus Side: Sparks have very little storage, which makes them difficult if you have long outings. Their lightweight comes with many penalties: small seats, more difficulty towing riders, reduced stability, and much harsher ride than other PWCs. Sparks also have a top speed of only 48MPH which may or may not be a negative for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People buy sparks for a few reasons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They are cheap&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They have the lowest fuel consumption of any ski on the market (by a wide margin)\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A spark burns 2.4 GPH (3.3 hours of riding) at full speed, the closest competitor is the Yamaha EX at 7.9 GPH (1.7 Hours of Riding). And as you go up in size and horsepower this gets worse. Stats are from &lt;a href=\"http://JetDrift.com\"&gt;JetDrift.com&lt;/a&gt; but unfortunately jetdrift only tested the flagship models at best cruising speed instead of full speed which could make a huge difference.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tidbit: A Sea-Doo 300HP RXT will burn 25GPH at 70MPH!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They want something fun to throw around and don&amp;#39;t ride long distances.\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The largest 3-up Spark weighs only 439 lbs Dry, with the 2-up about 405 lbs. They are incredibly agile and easy to throw around. They will launch into the air in even small waves if you command them to. The next step in the Sea-doo Line is the GTI 170 at a whopping 739 lbs dry. Bigger skis with bigger engines mean reduced fuel economy, so they carry more fuel; making the wet weight of any &amp;quot;non-Spark&amp;quot; PWC almost double the weight of a Spark. This will adversely affect handling no matter what a Redditor tells you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Example: My neighbors at the lake all have supercharged Sea-Doos and Yamahas, we often switch back and forth and try each other&amp;#39;s PWCs. Kids and young adults always come to my place to borrow my sparks unless towing. The older adults tend towards the fast, stable, and comfy cruisers. 30 and 40-somethings choose based on what they are in the mood for.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IMO the spark is the most fun you can have on the water and I&amp;#39;ve ridden most of the PWCs out there.

The air quality skyrockets causing nature to rapidly flourish, turning the entire planet into a beautiful garden. Climate change is defeated. Wars are a forgotten memory. True peace is finally achieved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is 2042, The sun mercifully explodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

A smooth ride and good grip\n4. Quality Components (my wish, not hers LOL).\n\nPrices:\n\n1. Cannodale Trail SE3 on Closeout for $1050 (typically 1500)\n2. Kona Mahuna $1200\n3. Roscoe 7 almost $1700\n4. Giant XTC2 1305 (typically 1450). Super light, but dunno if it would handle Trail well. Prob fine for us as we are all beginners. Not Sure\n5. Used Growler for $1200 (see below)\n\nMight consider a Fathom but we would have to order it. Hard to find inventory in Size Small unfortunately. I could also get a used Growler that has been almost totally upgraded for $1200 but that seemed a bit steep on a used bike. Rockshox Pike, 10sp Deore, Dropper Post, Tubeless\n\nIf it helps my son is on a Trek Marlin 7 (he just liked the color, I tried to talk him into something higher end). I am on a Trek Stache 9 with a bagillion upgrades done by PO.

It won out for the weight (comes tubeless), the fit, and she wanted more gears (it’s SRAM 1x12). We got it for $1300 which is about $300 off and they threw in a dropper for $135 installed. It even has a fork lockout which is a FANTASTIC feature. It actually makes a huge difference on climbs and flats. I want one now.\n\nShe rode it for 7 miles today on the trail and said \"this isn't just a better bike, it makes me feel like this is an entirely different sport\".\n\nI personally would have gone Roscoe but the Giant ergos were perfect and as the bike shop person said “you’ll ride a bike you like the look of a lot more”.

    "body": "I have a lake place, and my kids are now old enough to legally ride Jet Skis in my State (Michigan). I am looking to get a decent end-of-season deal on a pair, ideally under $15k. I'm looking for:\n\n1. Two 90hp Spark Skis with IBR, ideally two-seaters and ideally Trixx\n2. A Double Trailer (but I would only trailer to winterize, so singles may be ok)\n3. 2 Lifts\n\nI rode my neighbor's 2-up 90hp Spark with IBR and liked it more than his 155gtx (? on model). The spark felt more like the skis I had in the 90s (Sea-Doo SP) but faster and better. I also found the IBR was WAY better than yanking a bar to reverse. We have marinas for gas so having neural is a must. The bigger ski felt like a small boat, and I already have a wake boat for watersports. The skis are for monkeying around.\n\nI have two options and can water test both. With a less attractive 3rd bonus option.\n\n**Option 1: Two matching 90hp 2-up sparks w/IBR, double trailer, and two float-on lifts. \\~40 Hours and on the Market for a Week. $14,500**\n\nThey are white and black (I like understated more than flashy colors). On FB marketplace a guy is selling a pair of 2015 90hp 2-ups with IBR, a double trailer, and two float-on lifts. The lifts are worth about $2,000 each new, $1,250 used. He was asking $16,500 but lowered it to $14,500. If I wanted to make them sporty I would have to buy extended VTS kits for both and the IBR gates from a 2017+ ski as I understand it. Probably another grand give or take. Let's be honest, 2015 is older. Skis are kept outside but covered. Extremely low hours, owned by an older couple who rarely used them. If this package was $12 or $13k I would be all over it. I can install VTS anytime and I am handy.\n\n**Option 2: One 2017 2-Up 90HP with added extended VTS and One 2018 Trixx, Double Trailer, No Lift. \\~35 hours each, on the market for 3 weeks. $14,000**\n\n2-up is Yellow and the Spark is Orange with a Red Seat. They both look in great shape. Trailered and stored indoors. The 2-up has the extended VTS already installed to wheelie, etc. With these two I don't have to monkey with VTS and obviously, the Trixx has the adjustable handlebar and footrests. The downside here is kids may fight over who gets to ride the \"real Trixx\". The other downside is I have to buy a couple of lifts which add to the price. If I could get these for $12k it would be an amazing deal I think, but based on the market the price seems more than fair already. Been on the market for a few weeks but \"not in a rush to sell\" is on the listing.\n\n**Bonus Option 3: A 2016 3-up w/IBR and a 2018 Trixx. Double trailer with storage box. \\~80 hours each. On the market for 3 weeks and already dropped $3k to $13,000**\n\n3-up is red while the trixx is blue and red. Trixx unfortunately has boat speakers drilled into the hull above the footwells with a JL Bluetooth remote also drilled through the hull. The speakers are a big minus for me and why I listed this as a \"bonus option\". Also, the owner bought them used and never rode them. They have been stored indoors at least. With 80 hours and no impeller and wear ring replacement I also may be in for maintenance soon. The skis are registered out of state and they are from different states. This is a yellow flag, but might turn out fine. I didn't start out wanting a 3-up but if I hate it I understand I can convert it to 2-up. I would probably offer $11k on these\n\n**What would you do in my place? I could also look for deals on single skis or wait for something better to come along as the season comes to a close.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "body": "I searched around the sub, but would love community input! \n\n**The overview you can skip if you want:** I used to fly in the late 90s with 4-channel FM transmitters. I flew a ton, built in Balsa, and ran gassers. I am going electric this time around. I have plenty of fun fly trophies and did some 3d flying, streamer combat, and a bit of pylon stuff. Mostly I just flew about though. I was aged 8-14 when I last flew and I'm 40 now. I plan to Sim first, then grab a timber or something like that. I have a lake house so I definitely want to get build some float planes too. I never flew them before, but flaps and retracts sound like fun to have so extra channels help.\n\nI'd like 6+ channels, easy(ish) setup, and the ability to connect to a PC for sim use. Telemetry is a plus but they all seem to have it.\n\n# Here are the Tx's that keep coming up in my searches:\n\n**Radiomaster TX16 Mark II 4in1** \n\nIs the max a different model? Seems like there are a bunch of versions, Mark II, Max, 4in1, ELRS, etc. You can also spend an extra $180 on better sticks. \n\nReviews seem to say programming is quite confusing but it is well-featured. I work in tech and can muddle around with code and scripting but with three teenagers time is at a premium. I'd like to fly more than fiddle.\n\n**FrSky X20 - $450 ish.** \n\nI like the S model in red! But I haven't researched these much. Reviews report easier programming than Radiomaster and I like the screen on top design. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RCPlanes/comments/141u874/frsky_tandem_x20s_vs_radiomaster_tx16s_max/) compared the TX16 to the FrSky and OP chose the FrSky for his daily use.\n\n**Spektrum Variants - $400-800ish**\n\nAt least 6 channels but would like 8 or more. These seem to be \"the standard\" and are claimed to be easier to set up, easier to buddy cable, etc. But boy do you pay for it. I'm a big proponent of \"buy once cry once\" so I don't mind spending some coin, but if the radios above are better for the same $$$ I would go that way.\n\n**Other Choices?** \n\nSomething else out there? Am I spending too much just to get back into the hobby? Maybe a cheap FrSky or a RadioMaster Boxer is a better choice that I could hand off to my kids later?\n\nTHANK YOU if you read this far. Help me spend my money!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** thanks everyone! I am leaning towards TX16s with AG01 gimbals, maybe the x20 but I need to learn more about Ethos. \n\nLast option is I have a lead on a turbo timber evolution RTF with DX6. If I get a good price on that I’ll do it with a USB dongle for the sim. I can always upgrade down the line or keep the DX6 for my kids.\n\n**SECOND EDIT:**\nThanks for all the help everyone. The Turbo Timber fell through. The guy was 6 hours away and worked second shift :( We couldn't make the timing work.\n\nHowever I am the proud owner of a new to Me TX16S MKII MCK Edition radio with ELRS and the upgraded Gimbals with gimbal protectors, also has the cool USB lights on the gimbals. I got it for $220 used ($550 MSRP). The thing looks crazy colored but I am looking forward to it.\n\nI plan to start with some SIM work and then probably by a Turbo Timber evolution with the floats. I also plan to buy the 4 in 1 module for the radio.\n\nThis is the radio I bought https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/tx16s-mark-ii-max-pro-radio-controller-mck-edition-elrs-m2",

I flew a ton, built in Balsa, and ran gassers. I am going electric this time around. I have plenty of fun fly trophies and did some 3d flying, streamer combat, and a bit of pylon stuff. Mostly I just flew about though. I was aged 8-14 when I last flew and I&amp;#39;m 40 now. I plan to Sim first, then grab a timber or something like that. I have a lake house so I definitely want to get build some float planes too. I never flew them before, but flaps and retracts sound like fun to have so extra channels help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like 6+ channels, easy(ish) setup, and the ability to connect to a PC for sim use. Telemetry is a plus but they all seem to have it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Here are the Tx&amp;#39;s that keep coming up in my searches:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiomaster TX16 Mark II 4in1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the max a different model? Seems like there are a bunch of versions, Mark II, Max, 4in1, ELRS, etc. You can also spend an extra $180 on better sticks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reviews seem to say programming is quite confusing but it is well-featured. I work in tech and can muddle around with code and scripting but with three teenagers time is at a premium. I&amp;#39;d like to fly more than fiddle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FrSky X20 - $450 ish.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the S model in red! But I haven&amp;#39;t researched these much. Reviews report easier programming than Radiomaster and I like the screen on top design. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RCPlanes/comments/141u874/frsky_tandem_x20s_vs_radiomaster_tx16s_max/\"&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; compared the TX16 to the FrSky and OP chose the FrSky for his daily use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spektrum Variants - $400-800ish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least 6 channels but would like 8 or more.

    "communityName": "r/salesengineers",
    "parsedCommunityName": "salesengineers",
    "body": "I have held a BUNCH of Sales Engineering related roles. A few weeks back, I made a big write up of my work journey in a post asking about careers related to Sales Engineering, I thought the sub might enjoy it. Mine is just one story among many, but here goes:\n\n**(TL;DR: read the bold for a role list and the TL;DR section at the bottom)**\n\nI have been in Enterprise Software since age 15, starting with IT help-desk in 1998. The majority of my early career was spent as an SE of some sort, but I have held a bunch of other fun roles since then. I started in ERP, then went to Marketing Automation, then to CRM work which was mostly Salesforce. I list the positions below but I have held many IC and Management positions related to pre-sales. I am currently a Salesforce Enterprise Architect which is a fantastic job as an individual contributor with extremely good compensation. I will do this until my kids go to college, then I will return to Management. My 5-10 year plan is to find a role as a Chief Customer Officer at a mid size company (500m-2B).\n\nHow did I get all these roles? **I volunteered for anything cool or impactful.** I made friends and cultivated relationships with people who had interesting jobs. **I focused on making relationships OUTSIDE of my regular team.** When I was young **I would ask for coaching**, and when I became more established I would just ask for their opinion on things because I respected their POV and valued their experience. Everyone loves talking about themselves.\n\n**My most successful ice breaker was \"You seem to have an amazing career, I was wondering if you would take some time to tell me about how you got to where you are\". I've never gotten a no to that one.**\n\n---\n\n**My Path**\n\n1. Very early in my career I **built and maintained demo environments** for about 400 SEs worldwide. This was actually pretty fun. I got to work with Product Management, Product Development, Product Marketing, Sales, Sales Enablement and Presales. I also got to play with the Alpha and Beta releases of everything. It was also a very global role with lots of travel. This is a niche role now that most things are SaaS but there are still roles that do 100% demo environment setup out there. This required some basic Software Dev and IT experience but I loved it.\n2. I then spent **10ish years as an SE for a wide variety of products,** simply volunteering any time we acquired a new company to go and learn their product suite and teach their people our processes. I stagnated here for a while, the company wasn't growing fast enough. I should have left 3 years in and this stalled my career for a long while. It was time for a change and when we sparked a partnership with Salesforce I jumped to be a part of it.\n3. My first non SE role after about 5 years of experience was a **mix of SE, Product Management and Alliances**. I was part of a team that launched a new product on Salesforce's AppExchange. This was a very cool role, but a niche position so I won't spend time on it here.\n4. My company bought a competing CRM to Salesforce and I moved into an **Account Executive** position to try something new. I was a top performer for the 18 months I was in role, but I didn't have a single happy customer. The product was shit. Lesson learned: find companies with solutions you believe in, and that actually work well. \n5. I then exited into Consulting as a **Sales Engineer/Architect for a Consulting company** in my field (Salesforce at that point). This used 60% SE skills and the other 40% was consulting experience, which they let me learn on the job. I would scope projects, create proposals, write statements of work and then do kickoff and knowledge transfer to the delivery team. I also did a small amount of billable strategy consulting. Mostly on Governance, Executive Alignment and Business Process Reengineering. This was one of my favorite roles. Consulting without having to bill (mostly).\n6. My consulting company was bought by an Indian staffing firm. I took a **Product Management** role for a short time there, less than a year. That job was a blast. We made apps for common platforms that were targeted at the media and entertainment industry. Ultimately the Indian work culture killed me. I exited.\n7. I joined a small consulting company who was growing like crazy and I held a bunch of roles. I was there 4 years and my career skyrocketed. I joined as an **Solution Architect (both billable work and pre-sales work)** and sold their first few million dollar projects. I then was promoted to **managing a group of architects** and running pre-sales enablement for the company. It was extremely rewarding to share all of my career experience with smart people who knew product and configuration, but not how to sell. Later on there **I was promoted to Delivery Manager**, which is oversight and sales support for consulting projects. I managed a $10M practice with a bunch of direct and indirect reports. This role is similar to a Senior Manager at Deloitte or PWC. During my tenure we grew from 60 to 600 people. *Ultimately that type of growth leads to shitty projects eventually and when my blood pressure began approaching the red, I quit. The company should have turned away some work and didn't*. NOTE: This job is like crack-cocaine. I could work 80 hour weeks and still love it. If you love firefighting and taking a screaming customer to a reference-able level this job is fantastic. Also helping others grow their careers. If you ever take a role like this, make sure it comes with SIGNIFICANT equity. \n8. I am currently a **Pre-Sales Enterprise Architect** working for Salesforce. I do a combination of Technical Pre-sales work and Leadership / Strategy consulting. I meet with C-Level leaders at my customers on at least a weekly basis and help them to achieve Digital Transformation. I work with them to take their yearly strategic goals and make plans to achieve them using Technology, Data and Governance. This is an awesome gig, a great company, and a wonderful compensation and benefits package.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**So, what was my favorite and what would I recommend?** \n\nIf you are searching for money do Account Executive at an established firm with a lot of support. It's a good place to learn and with pre-sales experience you can hopefully skip the BDR / dialing for dollars phase. You have to ask yourself if you can grind though. It's a slog of chasing people (prospects, customers, help from your company) and relentless email, phone and follow ups.\n\nIf you are searching for fun mix of sales and tech, and a job where if you play your cards right you can make decent money and have quality of life, then Sales Engineering is likely for you. I don't think there is as much opportunity for career progression here as some of the other roles I listed, unless you work for a large or quickly growing company.\n\nIf you are searching for a challenge and valuable work experience, then consulting is extremely lucrative and a great place to take on new skills. **Consulting was my favorite.** I went from recommending things as an SE to actually making them happen. I did over 100 digital transformations during my time in consulting in just about every industry. I saw things go right, and go wrong. I now use those experiences to advise C-Level leadership teams on a weekly basis, and they really listen to what peers are doing.\n\n**My time in consulting gave me the most experience in the shortest amount of time, and the industry desperately needs people.** The growth is so fast that if you are good then there is ample opportunity for promotion.\n\n---\n\nP.S. - PM me anytime and I'd be happy to meet. I do a lot of volunteer career coaching and have gotten a handful of folks placed in the roles they wanted. Salesforce requires 56 hours a year of volunteer work so it's a win for both of us. For the record, I am not a recruiter and I am not chasing referral bonuses. I am VERY careful about who I personally refer.",

I love this setup compared to the old xFi all in one gateway.\n\nHowever, all clients are connecting to my FlexHD which is upstairs. If a client connects to the UDM's Access Point there will be no internet. And if you delete the network on the iPhone, then try to connect again anywhere near the UDM it won't even join the network. Walk upstairs next to the Flex and it works perfectly (flex is two floors up, line of sight would be 25-30 feet away). If I unplug the flex, then nothing can join the UDM. With one exception: a couple of my printers are super old and only have 2.4Ghz connections and they will join the UDM.\n\nPlugging into the UDM with an Ethernet cable works perfectly. On my MacBook if I ping the UDM and then unplug my ethernet cable so it falls back to wifi I get a weird combo of \"Host is Down\" and time out messages.\n\nSetup is super vanilla. No VLANs and I have single SSID. I realized (or suspect) it's been doing this all along. I tried to hard reset everything and set it up again only for it to do the same thing.\n\nLast night I tried changing the settings to things I read about in the forums (took it off auto, lowered 5Ghz power upstairs to try to force devices off the Flex) and some other basic recommendations,\n\nAny ideas?

On my MacBook if I ping the UDM and then unplug my ethernet cable so it falls back to wifi I get a weird combo of &amp;quot;Host is Down&amp;quot; and time out messages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Setup is super vanilla. No VLANs and I have single SSID. I realized (or suspect) it&amp;#39;s been doing this all along. I tried to hard reset everything and set it up again only for it to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I tried changing the settings to things I read about in the forums (took it off auto, lowered 5Ghz power upstairs to try to force devices off the Flex) and some other basic recommendations,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any ideas? I&amp;#39;m new to Ubiquity, but I have searched and tried to troubleshoot. I am running out of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One oddball thing is that the UDM&amp;#39;s IP sometimes blinks back and forth. I managed to get a video:\n&lt;a href=\"https://content.screencast.com/users/charliegage5539/folders/Snagit/media/39679504-2ff4-4c29-952e-7598f76487d0/2020-12-10_17-15-54.mp4\"&gt;https://content.screencast.com/users/charliegage5539/folders/Snagit/media/39679504-2ff4-4c29-952e-7598f76487d0/2020-12-10_17-15-54.mp4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Calcium 120ppm\n5. .4 ppm free Chlorine (frog @ease should be .5-1ppm)\n6. 4 (yes four) ppm Combined Chlorine &lt;-- Alarming Chloramines\n\nI added a few ounces of pH Minus and 5 ounces of Alk Plus, calculated using Taylors Acid Demand Calculator\n\n**NOON**\n\n1. Temp 101\n2. pH 8+ (off the scale for Taylor)\n3. Alk 80-90ppm\n4. Calcium 120ppm\n5. .2 ppm free Chlorine (frog @ease should be .5-1ppm)\n6. 8 (yes eight) ppm Combined Chlorine &lt;-- Alarming Chloramines\n\nAdded 8-10 tablespoons (about 4.5 oz) of pH minus, and later Added 3 Tablespoons of Dichlor shock. I also ordered calcium increaser overnight delivery, it's low but not low enough to warrant the long round trip to my spa place.\n\n**4 PM (just now)**\n\n1.

I would consider purchasing the Eero Pro, or the basic Eero but maybe there is something better.

    "body": "In another sub I was asked for advice on increasing your salary in tech, below was my response. I have coached, mentored, and hired many people in these fields and some have come from zero tech experience.\n\nI always say to follow the money, so getting on the sales side of things will increase your income if you have a bit of that personality or can fake it during your day job!\n\nYou have two avenues with fast tracks to increasing your income to at least $150k-$180k OTE (on target earnings) within 3-5 years. Keep in mind that this number can include bonuses/commissions, so it is not all base salary. You can take the **Pre-Sales Avenue** or the **Consulting Avenue** (working for a Systems Integrator, or working to install and configure software on behalf of the maker of that software). Below is some info on each, good luck out there, Both roles will net you $250k+ Salary after 10 years if you hustle.\n\n*I am not currently in a position with headcount and I have zero to gain from posting the following couple of sentences; it's just a hot field right now with lots of opportunity and open roles:* I personally work in the Salesforce.com world, and have done each of these roles in Senior / Managerial positions for 5+ years. Salesforce has a training and certification website at https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/home Training is free, but certification tests are $199 each, classroom training and tests are free if you are a military veteran. It's not easy but you can get into jobs in this area with zero experience, or if you have some tech background it will be easier. You can check it out if you want. Entry level positions are usually admins, consultants, or business analysts. If you can code, you can make a ton of money in this ecosystem but it has it's own coding languages which are more limited that Java, C++, etc. Many hardcore coders find it frustrating, but some love the simplicity of it.\n\nOn to the jobs:\n\n***\n\n***Presales / Sales Engineering***\n\nPresales roles blend Sales and Technology, you will be helping Salespeople to sell something that is technical. Your technical experience here and stories from working in the field are very much in demand, but you must be a good communicator and understand that *your entire goal is to sell.* That sometimes involves compromises, but no huge ethical conundrums. This means performing discovery with prospective clients (prospects) to identify opportunities for your company to sell software. Your first calls are usually explaining what your software does, sometimes performing a canned demo, or just talking about other clients of yours with challenges similar to your prospect's challenges (we call these case studies or success stories).\n\nYou would evaluate fit, which simply means whether your product would work for their requirements. You will ask what their goals are, and what their requirements are. You would then try to identify anything they want to do that your software doesn't do, and try to find a workaround, process change, or engineering change/customization that will make your product work for them. You will often have to integrate with other products here so knowing integration basics is good, but just the basics.\n\nYou may help your salesperson internally with understanding how your product can help, creating quotations, or other steps that require your technical expertise. You may also work with Partners or System Integrators (see explanation below) to help get a Statement of Work together which will show the timeline and budget needed to get your system up and running. Some products don't need this and can be setup by your customer themselves.\n\nYou will typically have goals that include revenue goals, which will result in a commission or bonus to you paid Monthly, Quarterly, or Yearly. You will also engage in ongoing learning and education, collaborate with other departments in your company, and give guidance to product managers on how to improve your product, based on information you are getting from prospects. You will often be called by Sales Management and other executives in your company to render opinion on whether a sale will happen and when (your Salespeople you support will have a rosy picture of this, your job is to discreetly give some reality).\n\nHaving basic finance abilities and the ability to communicate the VALUE of your solution really helps. Learn to read a 10-K for instance.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* You get to do new things and meet new people almost daily.\n* There is a variable component to your pay which means when you win you can celebrate mentally and with your bank account, sometimes in a big way (think 4-5 figures in a single deal sometimes)\n* You get to put your tech to work and tell lots of stories, without being on the hook for delivering them\n* Your work has big visibility to company management and your contribution will be appreciated and QUANTIFIED, which provides job security.\n* You will get to travel, and continue to hone your skills in your craft, paid for by the company.\n* Many of these roles have stock options or other perks. Big bay area companies can also have amazing benefits, startups not so much but you can win big if the startup grows and you have some kind of equity.\n* You can make 150k with 3-5 years experience, 250k with 10-15 years experience.\n* Your time is largely self directed, if you need someone to tell you what to do hour by hour the role is not for you.\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Pre-Covid, these roles typically had 20-40% travel. Some jobs have no travel, while others can be almost constant travel. *If you hesitate at all to say you will travel it will de-rank you in any job hunt (assuming the job requires it).*\n* The amount of your pay that is variable (based on actual sales contributions) can be high. Typically at least 25% and up to 50%. If your company isn't selling, it hurts your bottom line. Live off of your base salary along and don't use bonuses in your household budget.\n* It can take a while to start building your book of business, it might take up to 6-9 months to train, and start working on opportunities that have a chance to close, so bonuses may be somewhat distant at first, it can also make switching jobs harder.\n* Some organizations will have you competing for business with other people in your role, you will have to actively befriend Salespeople and build their trust so they will want to work for you. \n* Your personal brand is HUGE in these roles. Dress well, speak confidently, and if you don't know something be honest about it and chase down the answers you need. This can take a lot of time to find answers and can be frustrating.\n* Not usually a 9-5 job, you will be paid well but some weeks you will work 60 or more hours, and when traveling you will be working on presentations and demos, not watching netflix in your hotel room! On the flip side when things are seasonally slow you may only work 3 days a week and most of these jobs will let you take time off whenever your schedule allows.\n* Sometimes the jobs are high pressure\n* In Presales there is not always a huge career path. You can make 250k after 10+ years of experience and 150k with 3-5 years but you won't see a lot of C-Level officers with Presales backgrounds, you will be \"too important to promote\". A pure sales role can go anywhere.\n\n**How To:**\n\nLook for jobs labeled \"PreSales\" \"Sales Engineer(ing)\" or \"Solution Engineer\". Sometimes they are called \"solution architect\" too but that can be also used for consulting / implementation roles. When interviewing ensure to be open to travel, share stories of project you have worked on in the companies space, be friendly and sell yourself. Ensure you leave them with the sense that you will be confident in your abilities and make friends with Salespeople and prospective customers. Certifications here help. Really focus on things you have done that have required deep tech expertise but also working with other departments, clients, or leadership. You have to be an expert but also a team player.\n\n***\n\n***Consulting / Implementation***\n\nYou will be implementing software for clients, or advising them on making changes and improvements to the ways they run their business. You will be billed to the customer usually by the hour for anywhere form $175/hr to $500/hr. You will write requirements, document processes, configure systems, advise, and communicate quickly and effectively.\n\nYou will typically be performing work based on a contract (called an SOW or Statement of Work). It is important you follow the terms of the contract almost to the letter, and you would have do document any changes to that contract or inform superiors when your customer asks for things that are not in it, or tries to change it (called Scope Change / Change Control). This can be contentious.\n\nYou will almost always work in a team and have role names like: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Consultant, Solutions Architect, Technical Architect or Strategic Advisor.\n\nYou will need to have deep knowledge, always go the extra mile, train or upskill continuously, work long hours, and travel. However the rewards can be high. You don't need to have deep knowledge to begin, but you will be expected to learn quickly.\n\nCommon Software that is implemented would be: CRM, ERP, Integration / Middleware, E-Commerce, Financial/Billing, HR / HCM, HLS (healthcare and life sciences), Supply Chain, Collaboration, Cybersecurity, and many other specialized fields. You can look these up to learn more.\n\n*You can also do presales work for Consulting companies once you learn the business.*\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* You become an expert in your field quite quickly\n* Your salary can skyrocket in the right field, there are HUGE shortages of technical consultants in tech right now\n* You get to see things through, meaning not just look at portions of a business process, but truly implement change and improvements. \n* You will have war stories that are literally worth millions to future employers.\n* You will have a bonus component to your salary.\n* In medium to larger size firms you will have access to lots of experts to help guide you.\n* You can be an independent consultant and control your own hours, typically billing a client $125-$200 per hour.\n* You have huge opportunities to climb the ladder, and you can specialize in things that will help your career.\n* You can EASILY exit to working for any business after a career in consulting. Sometimes into very senior roles. You will have stories from solving problems for hundreds of customers that businesses want. Many businesses have no idea how others do things and need to pay for that information (from you!). \n* Lots of consulting firms hire College grads. Places like PWC, Deloitte, Accenture, and Slalom consulting may recruit on your campus if you are currently in school. They prefer high performers and recruit from larger or more exclusive universities (with exceptions).\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Working for customers can suck. They were probably told that the software did a million things it didn't do and you have to be the bearer of bad news.\n* Typically tons of travel, not always\n* You will be measured on the hours you bill, and sometimes have to compete to get on projects. Most companies will expect you to bill 30-36 hours per week. You can imagine your time for admin work and training are above and beyond those hours.\n* If you screw up, it will be VERY visible.\n* I find this career is harder to learn than presales, but sometimes easier to get into. I have done both for many years each.\n* Long hours, always on call. Sometimes weekends too.\n* Getting into the field with little experience will require networking and hustle on your part, and possibly learning or getting certifications that you may not be able to put to use if you can't find a job in that field.\n\n\n\n\n**How To:**\n\nLook for roles with the titles above, try to get professional certifications in your field, check your linkedin network. The tech world needs consultants more than anything right now. COVID has paused a lot of hiring temporarily, so use this as a time to contact some people in the jobs already and get guidance on how to get into the field.",

Big bay area companies can also have amazing benefits, startups not so much but you can win big if the startup grows and you have some kind of equity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can make 150k with 3-5 years experience, 250k with 10-15 years experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your time is largely self directed, if you need someone to tell you what to do hour by hour the role is not for you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pre-Covid, these roles typically had 20-40% travel. Some jobs have no travel, while others can be almost constant travel. &lt;em&gt;If you hesitate at all to say you will travel it will de-rank you in any job hunt (assuming the job requires it).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The amount of your pay that is variable (based on actual sales contributions) can be high. Typically at least 25% and up to 50%. If your company isn&amp;#39;t selling, it hurts your bottom line. Live off of your base salary along and don&amp;#39;t use bonuses in your household budget.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It can take a while to start building your book of business, it might take up to 6-9 months to train, and start working on opportunities that have a chance to close, so bonuses may be somewhat distant at first, it can also make switching jobs harder.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some organizations will have you competing for business with other people in your role, you will have to actively befriend Salespeople and build their trust so they will want to work for you. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your personal brand is HUGE in these roles. Dress well, speak confidently, and if you don&amp;#39;t know something be honest about it and chase down the answers you need. This can take a lot of time to find answers and can be frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not usually a 9-5 job, you will be paid well but some weeks you will work 60 or more hours, and when traveling you will be working on presentations and demos, not watching netflix in your hotel room! On the flip side when things are seasonally slow you may only work 3 days a week and most of these jobs will let you take time off whenever your schedule allows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the jobs are high pressure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In Presales there is not always a huge career path. You can make 250k after 10+ years of experience and 150k with 3-5 years but you won&amp;#39;t see a lot of C-Level officers with Presales backgrounds, you will be &amp;quot;too important to promote&amp;quot;. A pure sales role can go anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for jobs labeled &amp;quot;PreSales&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sales Engineer(ing)&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Solution Engineer&amp;quot;. Sometimes they are called &amp;quot;solution architect&amp;quot; too but that can be also used for consulting / implementation roles. When interviewing ensure to be open to travel, share stories of project you have worked on in the companies space, be friendly and sell yourself. Ensure you leave them with the sense that you will be confident in your abilities and make friends with Salespeople and prospective customers. Certifications here help. Really focus on things you have done that have required deep tech expertise but also working with other departments, clients, or leadership. You have to be an expert but also a team player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consulting / Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will be implementing software for clients, or advising them on making changes and improvements to the ways they run their business. You will be billed to the customer usually by the hour for anywhere form $175/hr to $500/hr. You will write requirements, document processes, configure systems, advise, and communicate quickly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will typically be performing work based on a contract (called an SOW or Statement of Work). It is important you follow the terms of the contract almost to the letter, and you would have do document any changes to that contract or inform superiors when your customer asks for things that are not in it, or tries to change it (called Scope Change / Change Control). This can be contentious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will almost always work in a team and have role names like: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Consultant, Solutions Architect, Technical Architect or Strategic Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will need to have deep knowledge, always go the extra mile, train or upskill continuously, work long hours, and travel. However the rewards can be high. You don&amp;#39;t need to have deep knowledge to begin, but you will be expected to learn quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Common Software that is implemented would be: CRM, ERP, Integration / Middleware, E-Commerce, Financial/Billing, HR / HCM, HLS (healthcare and life sciences), Supply Chain, Collaboration, Cybersecurity, and many other specialized fields. You can look these up to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also do presales work for Consulting companies once you learn the business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You become an expert in your field quite quickly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your salary can skyrocket in the right field, there are HUGE shortages of technical consultants in tech right now&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You get to see things through, meaning not just look at portions of a business process, but truly implement change and improvements. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will have war stories that are literally worth millions to future employers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will have a bonus component to your salary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In medium to larger size firms you will have access to lots of experts to help guide you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can be an independent consultant and control your own hours, typically billing a client $125-$200 per hour.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have huge opportunities to climb the ladder, and you can specialize in things that will help your career.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can EASILY exit to working for any business after a career in consulting. Sometimes into very senior roles. You will have stories from solving problems for hundreds of customers that businesses want. Many businesses have no idea how others do things and need to pay for that information (from you!). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lots of consulting firms hire College grads. Places like PWC, Deloitte, Accenture, and Slalom consulting may recruit on your campus if you are currently in school. They prefer high performers and recruit from larger or more exclusive universities (with exceptions).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working for customers can suck. They were probably told that the software did a million things it didn&amp;#39;t do and you have to be the bearer of bad news.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Typically tons of travel, not always&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will be measured on the hours you bill, and sometimes have to compete to get on projects. Most companies will expect you to bill 30-36 hours per week. You can imagine your time for admin work and training are above and beyond those hours.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you screw up, it will be VERY visible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I find this career is harder to learn than presales, but sometimes easier to get into. I have done both for many years each.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Long hours, always on call. Sometimes weekends too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Getting into the field with little experience will require networking and hustle on your part, and possibly learning or getting certifications that you may not be able to put to use if you can&amp;#39;t find a job in that field.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for roles with the titles above, try to get professional certifications in your field, check your linkedin network. The tech world needs consultants more than anything right now. COVID has paused a lot of hiring temporarily, so use this as a time to contact some people in the jobs already and get guidance on how to get into the field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "Hi All! I’m having trouble finding the relevant codes for doing a fireplace install. I have a ton of DIY experience but not a ton of HVAC. I’m putting in a direct vent fireplace. It’s a Lennox peninsula 30,000-39,000 BTU. I have had a fireplace pro come in (paid) to look over my plans but one part of the plan has changed. \n\n1 - Can direct vent pipe be hung from the ceiling and left exposed in an unfinished area of the basement? This would have full clean ace and be hung from the ceiling with plumbers tape every 2 feet as the manufacturer instructs. For aesthetic purposes and ease of install (I wouldn’t have to move any gas, electric, or framing) I now want to run my piping below the ceiling in the basement and through a False wall as opposed to through a floor joist and with plenty of clearances on the sides and top. This would go through a storage room after it exits the false wall area. I don’t know if I need to worry about the venting pipe hanging there without drywall and framing protecting it from human hands, etc. This also has the appropriate H and V measurements as well per install instructions. \n\n2 - are there any issues running horizontal piping directly through a basement wall? It’s will be 3 feet above grade when it exits and will exit about 6 feet who from the basement floor. My pipe is 7.5 inches on the outer (Lennox secureflex) and my plan was to seal it in with mil pac black. The run through the wall will actually be solid pipe from a Lennox horizontal termination kit. This has clearance from combustibles of 18” both outer and inner. \n\nThere is nothing in the wall there per plans and the concrete contractor who is licensed, bonded, and insured had no issue with it. He will use an 8” core drill and I will keep the slug in case I ever need to remove the venting. \n\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can provide. My concrete person, a contractor friend, and the fireplace dealer both see no issue but since I am paying them for their services I would very much appreciate an outside opinion. Gas is being installed professionally as well so all I am doing is framing and electrical. As well as adding a DC motor blower (to keep blower noise down).",
