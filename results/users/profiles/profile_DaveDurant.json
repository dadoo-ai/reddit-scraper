It does all seem to work fine when it turns on but then the E74 comes back within a couple minutes.\n\n\\- there's a little pump next to the air unit that sends water to the hot water heater drain. if I add some clean water to this, it turns on and runs for a minute - I can see the water going into the drain\n\n\\- if there is a float switch cutoff, I can't find it - pretty sure I don't have one\n\n\\- i put some water in the air unit drip pan and ran a shop vac to where the pump inlet is, and could see it sucking up the water from the drip pan\n\n\\- it does have a Wet Switch but that seems to be happy. This is sorta buried in the duct work under the air unit - I can't see how you could ever replace this or reset it without cutting up the ducts - but I have an endoscope thing and that shows that the light is green\n\n\\- when the unit turns on, I can definitely feel the cold line from the compressor getting noticeably cold. the return to the compressor seems to get really hot but I don't know how that normally feels\n\n\\- wiring is really not my thing but everything inside the air unit seems ok. nothing jumped out at me as obviously crimped/broken/loose or anything like that\n\n\\- the wiring behind the Nest seems ok.. I tugged a little at the wires a little with needle-nose and found nothing loose\n\nAt a loss what to do next.. Do the Nest devices go bad?

Otherwise been working great. No complaints.\n\nRecently, some of the buttons stopped working. In particular, the Off button doesn't work, which is not ok. This is the membrane button style where the whole control panel is a big, single piece of plastic pressed up against some actual buttons behind. You press on the plastic and it complies enough to trigger the button behind.\n\nI pulled the cover off the top/back to get at the controller and it appears that the control board just isn't pressing up against the front membrane thing on one side anymore. I tried to push it back on and it worked great for about 5 minutes then started acting up again.\n\nIs there a way I can fix this without having to get a new board? I'm assuming some bit of glue or tape or something has just gotten old and is losing it's grip instead of something mechanical or electrical being broken. I'm not sure what I'd use to refresh the glue/tape though. I didn't actually pull the board off, because I'm a bit chicken. I can though, if that's needed to diagnose this more.\n\nAny tips on how to revive this? I could just gorilla tape it down but that doesn't seem smart..\n\nTY!",

Literally just plugged it in and it seems to work fine)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2nd, has anyone gotten the StellarMate app to work in BlueStacks?

I have not seen anything that says this won&amp;#39;t work with StellarMate but also haven&amp;#39;t seen anything saying it will.  I think I&amp;#39;d like to use this just as storage - not as the boot device.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Related, is there a max size that StellarMate can use? I see these SSDs up to 2TB, overkill, at the local MicroCenter but thought I saw a note somewhere saying StellarMate can only see 64GB or 128GB on microsd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(edit: clearly I didn&amp;#39;t add 2 + 2 and come up with &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s basically just a usb disk&amp;quot; because it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;ssd&amp;quot;. Literally just plugged it in and it seems to work fine)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd, has anyone gotten the StellarMate app to work in BlueStacks? It works fine on my Android phone and old, crappy, small Android tablet but not on my nice Windows laptop via BlueStacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In BlueStacks, I can use Chrome to get to the local StellarMate web page and web manager. The name stellarmate.local does not work in BlueBluestacks but the IP address does. Not sure how to get this to work or get debug info or what..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
