I want to say it&amp;#39;s a 2017 model with rim brakes, and mounts for discs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bike is fine, but she would prefer simpler gearing than the stock 3x8, so I figured an upgrade to 1x (11? 12? Not sure it matters?) should simplify and get her out on more rides with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m not sure where to start. Obviously entry-level parts are appropriate here. I am assuming I&amp;#39;ll need cassette, BB, cranks, and derailleur+shifter? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Search results return the Shimano SLX M7100 and Sram Eagle NX that come in under $300, which seems doable. I just want to make sure I&amp;#39;m not going to run into any surprises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Only about $20, not the end of the world.  Found the option to file the claim via the app.  Great.  Figured it'd be like nearly every other service in existence, and at least get some kind of one-time courtesy credit if they were too busy to actually investigate.\n\nNope!  Got a fairly unfriendly notice to the effect of \"we will not be compensating you\".  Nice.  Okay, so I'll try the chat support.  They're clearly chatbots.  Unable to address any questions other than to reiterate what was said in the error message, and then disconnect ASAP.\n\n**Support Bot**: Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We will further investigate this request and we will follow up via email. Is there anything else I can help you with?   \n**Me**: How long will I have to wait for my refund?   \n**Bot**: until the investigation is done.   \n**Bot**: Is there anything else I can help you with?   \n**Me**: How long am I supposed to wait to be refunded for something that I never received?   \n**Bot**: I will not be able to compensate you right now. our specialized team will email you regarding for this \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...this went on a bit as I tried to get information.  ANY information would have been good.  Finally:  \n**Bot**: within 24-48 hours\n\n**Me**: I have to say, this is pretty poor customer service   \n**Me**: I'm aiming this at the service and not you, &lt;bot&gt;.   \n**Me**: A pretty terrible introduction for a new customer \n\nThe closest thing to a human response I got was this\n\n**Bot**: I understand you, but right now, I will not be able to compensate you. You have to wait for the email that our specialized team will send you   \n**Me**: Yeah, I got that   \n**Bot**: Alright! Thanks for getting in touch with DoorDash Support.

I recall years of new Galaxies with what seemed like silly \"smart\"- or \"S”-prefixed gimmicks that appeared to be poor imitations of stock Android features, at best. And TouchWiz. Yikes.\n\nSo, here I am. A LineageOS devotee with a new S10e. What are the essentials? What actually works? Who is this Bixby dude, and what can he do that the Google Lady can't? \n\nI want to give this one a fair shake as it seems promising out of the box. The Smart Switch tool to pull my apps from the old phone worked quite well. The Edge Panel... not so much. Gestures in place of the Nav Buttons is a winner. What am I missing out on?",

The rubber coating has deteriorated, leaving the bare metal underneath showing in places.\n\nI've found that the parts aren't overly pricey ([here's the back piece at ECS](https://www.ecstuning.com/ES92911/)), and the back piece just snaps in by the looks of it.  The side pieces though look a little trickier for a DIY (need to remove the interior rubber trim inside he doors to access).
