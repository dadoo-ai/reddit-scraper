I only have a small table top joiner and I know the extension wings are far to short to accurately join something so long. I've read up on several options, but they almost always require a perfectly straight edge to start. The options I've seen:\n\n* Straight edge and circular saw\n* Straight edge and flush trim router bit (u/joelav)\n* Straight edge table saw sled\n* Hand plane\n\nOf the above, I am leaning towards the table saw, as it is the best tool I have (3hp SawStop PCS). Next would be the router and I do have the proper shear cut 2\" bit. Then circular saw although I only have a small 20v dewalt. Hand plane is last as I do not currently possess the skills to accurately join such a long board. My largest plane is also a #6. \n\nThe thing holding me back is, what do I use for a straight edge that is over 9' long? I previously built a table saw jointing sled, but it is only 6' long and made out of melamine shelf material. It worked pretty well for the shorter boards. The boards are 8\" wide, so the sled would need to be around 10\" wide. If I'm using the router, I could get away with a narrower straight edge. I'm DFW, so access to Home Depot and Lowes is no problem. \n\n**tldr; What do I use for a 9' straight edge as a guide?**",

    "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the insight! I believe they might be laminated, but I have a hard time telling. Ultimately I paid $200 for all of this, plus a starrett combo square, five vintage marples chisels, and a very nice caliper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also bought a Lie-Nielsen maple bench, low angle jack, low angle block, and router plane for $1000. Almost all completely unused. The Japanese chisels were the bonus and I’m excited to give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
