The stuff people can’t avoid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s the same disconnect we’re seeing with the unemployment rate. Officially it&amp;#39;s holding steady at 5.1%, but that doesn’t reflect the growing number of “open to work” posts on LinkedIn, the layoff threads on Reddit, or the steady stream of redundancy announcements from major companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The data says one thing. Lived experience says another. And increasingly, people are trusting what they see with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You can really tell the chef knows their stuff (turns out they trained under Sam Ng from Treasure Kitchen, which makes total sense once you&amp;#39;ve had a bite).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prices are super reasonable considering the quality and good sized portions. Definitely great value, but just a heads-up: there is a public holiday surcharge, so factor that in if you&amp;#39;re heading in during long weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall: solid spot, great food, awesome value. Will definitely be back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

That said, the tartare sauce it came with was excellent and really elevated the dish.\n\nFor mains, I had the creamy lobster and crab fettuccine – absolutely heavenly! The creaminess was perfect, and you could really taste the crab and lobster, with generous pieces throughout. It was a great value for $45. Chris went with the scallop risotto, which was also very good. There were at least 8 scallops, and the risotto was rich and flavoursome. The only downside was the cauliflower, which neither of us are fans of.\n\nOverall, the meal was fantastic, and the total came to $110, including two non-alcoholic drinks.

It has affected him more than I thought as he totally jumped down my throat for trying to suggest things.  My reaction to that was to look sad which then made him feel bad for his reaction.  We are ok as a few minutes before I left, I parked my emotions to try and comfort him.  His love language is touch so I cuddled and kissed him and we talked a little about other stuff. I have now left his place.  Should I leave him alone for the rest of the weekend to digest?  How can I help him and when or if should I approach him to discuss the incident?",
