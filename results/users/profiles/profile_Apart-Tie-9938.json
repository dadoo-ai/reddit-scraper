    "communityName": "r/TheLastAirbender",
    "parsedCommunityName": "TheLastAirbender",
    "body": "I’ve been thinking about how The Legend of Korra and the Star Wars sequel trilogy both faced similar challenges: they had to follow beloved originals, appeal to old fans while drawing in new ones, and deal with significant production issues. But in my opinion, Korra succeeded in ways the Star Wars sequels didn’t. Here’s why:\n\n1. World-Building and Continuity\n\nKorra nailed the evolution of the Avatar world. Republic City was a brilliant addition, showcasing how Aang’s efforts to unite the nations reshaped the world. We got to see the long-term consequences of the original story, like the integration of cultures and the rise of industrialization. Characters like Toph’s daughter and Aang’s children honored the original cast while letting Korra and her companions take center stage.\n\nBy contrast, the Star Wars sequels hit the reset button. Returning to an Empire vs. Rebels dynamic erased the victories of the original trilogy’s heroes. The Republic was barely fleshed out before it was destroyed, and there was little exploration of how Luke, Leia, and Han shaped the galaxy after the fall of the Empire. Instead of expanding the world, the sequels felt like a retread.\n\n2. New Themes and Ideas\n\nKorra wasn’t afraid to push the boundaries of the Avatar universe. Each season introduced new and interesting themes: societal inequality (Amon and the Equalists), PTSD and trauma (Korra’s recovery arc), and spirituality vs. modernity. While not every season was perfect, they consistently brought fresh ideas to the table.\n\nThe Star Wars sequels, on the other hand, leaned too heavily on nostalgia. While The Last Jedi tried to introduce bold themes like failure and democratizing the Force, these ideas were abandoned by The Rise of Skywalker. The trilogy overall didn’t expand on the Star Wars mythos in meaningful ways.\n\n3. Respect for Legacy Characters\n\nKorra struck a perfect balance with its legacy characters. Aang’s impact was everywhere, from Republic City to Tenzin’s role as Korra’s mentor. But the series didn’t rely on him to carry the story—Korra’s journey was distinct and personal. Appearances from Toph, Zuko, and Katara felt earned and served the story.\n\nThe Star Wars sequels struggled here. The arcs of Luke, Leia, and Han often felt incomplete or mishandled. For example, Luke’s portrayal in The Last Jedi divided fans, and there was little payoff for his story by the end of the trilogy. Instead of celebrating their legacy, the sequels often felt like they sidelined or undercut these beloved characters.\n\n4. Production Challenges\n\nBoth Korra and the Star Wars sequels faced behind-the-scenes hurdles. Nickelodeon never gave Korra a clear multi-season plan, forcing the writers to craft each season as a standalone story. This resulted in Korra lacking as a major Epic like its predecessor, but the writers were consistently able to tell a story that kept things fresh and introduced new perspectives to the lore and world.\n\nThe Star Wars sequels, despite having a planned trilogy, lacked a unified vision. The lack of coordination between J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson, combined with Disney’s desire to please everyone, resulted in a disjointed story and inconsistent tone.\n\n5. Legacy and Reception\n\nWhile Korra initially faced criticism for not being ATLA, its reputation has grown over time. Fans now appreciate how it honored the Avatar legacy while exploring new ideas. The Star Wars sequels, meanwhile, remain divisive. Individual films (The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi) have their defenders, but the trilogy as a whole is widely seen as inconsistent and unfulfilling.\n\nConclusion\n\nKorra succeeded because it respected the world of ATLA while daring to evolve and explore fresh ideas. The Star Wars sequels, by contrast, played it too safe in some ways (recycling old conflicts) while being disjointedly bold in others (Luke’s portrayal, Rey’s parentage).",

In Napoleon Hill’s famous self help book, Think and Grow Rich, he advised creating a mastermind of other success oriented individuals for mutual problem solving and goal setting. \n\nHill was a bit wacky and took this a step further with his invisible counsel. This method involved holding an imaginary conversation with people Hill admired, like Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Carnegie. He would ask them questions and imagine what their response would be based off his knowledge of them from biographies and history.\n\nThis is actually a fun thing to do with ChatGPT. Ask it to build your invisible counsel and then suggest the people you’d like included. GPT will then create an engaging conversation with these people that is a bit eccentric but it’s kind of fun to engage with archetypes of certain characteristics. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger may be your advisor for fitness and discipline while Washington may give advice rooted in honor and leadership.\n\nIt’s also fun to ask GPT to simulate a conversation between these people and enjoy the back and forth. Almost like an AI generated podcast where your favorite figures discuss you and your problems.",

    "body": "Prompt: Write me a story about a proctologist who develops the ability to taste with his fingers and he has to find a way to turn off the power because every time he performs an operation he tastes everything through his finger.\n\n\n\nDr. Michael Jacobs had been a proctologist for over 20 years, and he thought he had seen it all. But one day, during a routine operation, something strange happened. As he inserted his finger to examine his patient, he suddenly experienced a sharp burst of flavor on his tongue.\n\nAt first, he thought it was just his imagination. But as he continued the operation, he realized that he could taste everything he touched with his fingers.\n\nAt first, Dr. Jacobs was thrilled. It was like having a superpower - he could taste things that no one else could. But soon he realized that this new ability was more of a curse than a blessing.\n\nEvery time he performed an operation, he tasted everything through his fingers. The taste of blood, feces, and other bodily fluids made him feel sick to his stomach. He tried wearing gloves, but the taste still came through.\n\nHe realized that he needed to find a way to turn off this strange power. He consulted with his colleagues, but none of them had ever heard of anything like it.\n\nDr. Jacobs began to experiment with different methods to turn off the power. He tried meditation, hypnosis, and even acupuncture. But nothing seemed to work.\n\nOne day, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He had read about a rare plant that was rumored to have the ability to nullify supernatural powers. He traveled to the remote jungle where the plant grew and found a local medicine man who was willing to help him.\n\nThe medicine man brewed a potion from the plant and instructed Dr. Jacobs to drink it. At first, he felt nothing. But then, slowly but surely, the taste in his fingers began to fade away.\n\nDr. Jacobs was overjoyed. He returned to his practice, grateful to be able to perform his operations without the strange taste in his fingers.\n\nBut he knew that he would never forget the strange and terrifying experience. And he vowed to never take his sense of taste for granted again.",

On the account level, the website is xyz.com and john's lead email address is john@xyz.com. Intuitively we should know this is a match because his domain in the email matches the website field for the account object. \n\nIs it possible to set up a rule that would alert the lead viewer that a matching account was found for John Doe by finding an account where the domain of the email address is equal to the company website?",
