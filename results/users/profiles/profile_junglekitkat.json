Trip to the vet is definitely needed and have them check albumin levels this was the other red flag outside of loosing weight that there was an issue with her absorbing nutrients, would also look into getting in with an internal medicine specialist, we had a 3 month wait to get into any of them around us and in the meantime went through basic blood tests with normal vet. Good luck, there are many diagnosis that have similar symptoms so can take a while to get the right one!",
