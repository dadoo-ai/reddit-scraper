They prescribed me 750mg Metformin and some blood pressure/cholesterol meds. I did not have these filled by the pharmacy until December 6th and have been taking them regularly. \n\nI largely cut out carbs from my diet as well and was prescribed Mounjaro to go along with the diet change. My first injection was last Thursday, 12/14.\n\nI've been testing my blood sugar in the morning, before and after meals, and before going to sleep daily and have been consistently between 80 to 110, with the exception of one time after having an Italian hoagie as a celebration following the birth of my daughter and it went to 122 (that was food my wife couldn't have during pregnancy and we had planned this for months).\n\nOut of curiosity, I bought an A1c test today, and it said my A1c was 4.8...\n\nThat doesn't sound right to me given the short time period and all, but I honestly don't know enough.\n\nIf that sort of improvement is indeed not feasible, is it likely that the store bought test is just way off? Or is the lab test off?\n\nETA: The reason I checked in the first place is that the mySugr app estimated my A1c at 4.9, which again sounded odd to me.\n\nETA 2: Just ran another two tests at home and got readings of 4.3 and 4.6. This is the CVS brand A1c test. From what I've seen review wise elsewhere, these should give a decent ballpark, but obviously not that precise. ",
