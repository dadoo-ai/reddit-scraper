Been trying for a second ever since, including three failed iuis. Moving on to ivf (may do another iui with my ob in the meantime while waiting to start ivf). \nIt’s been a long 17 months trying for number two and I feel like we have a long way to go with our ivf journey. My husband and I both come from large families and wanted that for our family. But I can’t imagine doing this again. If I’m able to have number two, which feels like a big if, I’m done.
