    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nOur young company has recently voiced a desire to start a post-sales process.\n\n**The basics are:**\n\n* We sell to private people\n* Sales cycle is relatively short\n* All work is done on Lead\n* When customer buys, Sales Rep converts into an Account\n* 1-2 weeks after conversion, everything is finalized\n* Customer Receives automated \"how was your experience?\"\n* If they say \"we were happy!\" we'd like to follow up in the below fashion\n\n**Follow-up**\n\nJunior Rep has 4-5 potential outcomes they aim to achieve\n\n1. Get one or more Reference Leads from the happy customer\n2. Make customer post a positive review on one or more platforms (Facebook, Google, Trustpilot, etc)\n3. Upsell (though, at this point, we are relatively sure we've covered all bases, so if the junior rep does manage to upsell, it means that the initial sales rep missed something)\n4. Generate a \"Partner Referral\" (we have a few partners that we generate Leads for, so the Junior Rep would qualify the customer to see if they'd make a good Lead for one of our Partners)\n\n**Current Setup**\n\nI initially did a quick \"let's just have *something* to work with\" solution, to see if the concept makes sense for us, which works like this:\n\n1. Customer replies \"Yes\" to the automated \"did you have a goog experience?\" SMS\n2. An Opportunity is created\n3. A Junior Sales Rep calls the customer\n4. Junior Sales rep uses a multi-select picklist field to mark which outcomes were achieved, e.g. \"Partner Referral; Reference Lead\" (two positive outcomes).\n5. When Junior Rep estimates that there's nothing more to gain from this follow-up Opportunity, they close the Opportunity - if any positive outcome was achieved, they close it as Closed Won, otherwise Closed Lost.\n\n**What's Next?**\n\nThe above was never ment to be the final solution - it was meant to be a Proof of Concept for the follow-up calls, which has been successful, so now we want to make a more solid, long term solution.\n\nThe existing solution works, but my concern is, that it gets a little crowded on the Opportunity. If there are multiple potential references, separate partner referrals, etc. \n\nI've thought about doing a solution where the user opens a screen flow and then in the screen flow, determines which opportunities to create - so they may create e.g. 5 opportunities related to the same account, and have them separated by a subcategory somehow, e.g.\n\n2x Partner Referral Opportunity\n\n2x Reference Lead Opportunity\n\n1x Positive Review Opportunity\n\nThis would of course mean that we create *a lot* *more opportunities* than we did before, but it may be a simpler overview.\n\n**Question:**\n\nSo my question is, how would you set this up? It is not a requirement to use Opportunities.\n\n*The Acceptance Criteria are:*\n\n* Junior Rep can \n   * Call customers who said that they were happy with their experience\n   * Have an overview of upcoming calls, appointments, etc on this type of Opportunity (we have a system for logging appointments, etc)\n   * Easily log positive outcomes\n* Management can \n   * Meassure what we achieve during these calls (How many reference leads, partner referrals, positive reviews, etc) and how each Junior Rep is performing\n   * See how much Junior Reps have in their pipelines\n\nEdit 2: the idea initially, using Opps, was to be able to see \"This Post-Sales Opp, generated these 3 positive outcomes\" for example. So you'd have an overview of not just how many of each we've generated, but also \"If we call a customer after everything is completed, what can we realistically expect to gain from it?\"",

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\n  \nI have a question about how this scenario would be executed.\n\n  \n**Three Objects**\n\n* Object A\n* Object B\n* Object C\n\n**Two Flows**\n\n* Flow A (Record-Triggered Flow for Object A, running Async when Object A is Created)\n* Flow B (Record-Triggered Flow when Object B is Created)\n\n**Scenario**\n\n1. A record of Object A is created via API and Flow A runs *asynchronously* \n2. 50% of the way through Flow A, a Create element, creates a record of the Object B\n3. Flow B is triggered and, as mentioned is advanced and takes quite a bit of time to complete\n4. At the end of Flow B, a record of Object C is Created.\n\n  \nSo my question is\n\n1. What happens when Flow A creates a record, which triggers Flow B? Does Flow A finish first and then Flow B runs? Does Flow A pause while Flow B runs and resumes once its done? Do they just run at the same time independant of each other?\n2. If Flow A *does not* wait for Flow B to finish, is there any smooth way to alter the setup, so that it does?\n\nThe reason for my question is that I would like Flow A to get the the record of Object C - but depending on the order of how these flows run, that may or may not be possible.\n\nSo far I am handling the scenario in a different way, that I am not a 100% satisfied with.\n\n**The current setup is**\n\n1. Flow A runs\n2. Call an auto-launched flow (Same as I'd do in the record-triggered flow b)\n3. This auto-launched flow creates a record for Object C\n4. The record variable is available for output and Flow A gets it again, at the end of the subflow run.",

It works, but with a hick-up right at the end.\n\nSo my approach so far has been\n\n1. In Maps configuration create a Custom Action, that launches a Screen Flow\n2. Let the user input a date, utilizing the new Action button to call another flow, which then returns a list of available Locations\n3. Create a Map Layer and some Map Layer configuration records, directly in the flow, to create a Map Layer that is immediately available in the map.\n\n  \nMy issue is that if I just click the newly created layer in Maps, it fails to load with the message \"Refresh the page and try again.\"\n\nHowever, if I instead of just clicking it to put the markers on the map, go to Edit it and then click \"Save and plot\" from the edit screen (without making any changes) then it works.\n\nI've uploaded a few screenshots of the UI, in case it's not entirely clear where I am navigating around.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ZyLoYA7](https://imgur.com/a/ZyLoYA7)\n\n  \nI really hope there's a Salesforce Maps expert out there - this works, but it's just so clunky at the very last part where you have to \"hack it\" to plot the Markers.\n\n",
