Really my only critique would be to just keep in mind, while assembling your reel, who you want to market to/ who you want to work for.

On the flip side, it being as it is, the picture certainly communicates a unnerving feeling as the subject doesn't immediately pop completely. What I mean by that is that subject is very obviously floating lifelessly in a black pool of death water, but we can't see the subject's face and connect emotionally, which for me is the unnerving part. The limbs also seem to fade into the water and look more like bones.",

Being rather new to photography, I really wanted to shoot something mundane and make it seem somehow magical. In this picture I wanted to get a nice sophisticated bokeh using the natural light that bled through the leaves of the trees. It turned out to give the moss a sort of luminescence around the edges as well. ",

    "body": "Very interesting parallel! Also: From reading the comments, I've gathered that the general consensus is that Megan's becoming an actress has metaphorically and literally bled into her role in her relationship with Don. (Margarine trying to be butter.) The reason I reiterate this is that my girlfriend brought up the point that Betty was, up until her separation with Don, also attempting to fulfill a role that had already been laid out for her. This conversation came about when I had commented on January Jones's cold and almost too rehearsed execution of her lines. Now that I see that as intentional, the subtleties of her character become far more pronounced. What especially struck me this episode is how starkly different Betty was acting, not cold or practiced, but warm and organic. You could really see the wheels turning in her head in the way she interacted with Don. I'm excited to see whether Don utilizes this most recent interaction as an insight into his own mind and where his desires are rooted, or if he will simply pursue Betty once more.",
