Not from the bank, obviously, but the employees.&lt;br/&gt;\nThere will always be a database where these transactions will always be recorded - which they will use as opposed to the simple POP.&lt;br/&gt;\nCall standard bank, mention the transaction number.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt is almost impossible to tell nowadays. If you&amp;#39;re selling something, which I think you are - call the bank.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlso - never release anything until cash is cleared. I don&amp;#39;t care what someone says. It needs to clear.&lt;br/&gt;\nChoose legit sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

My work is now a lot less and I have a few hours free at night where I can head through it all.  \nMy only worry is, that I am too late? I don't want to do private servers either as I know nothing about them and would like the achievements to be on my blizzard account.   \nThank you for taking the time to read through yet another noob question.

I am by nature a metal head - hence the enjoyment of techno - raw, dirty and emotional substance.&lt;br/&gt;\nThat being said, I am coming in new again, but what I am faced with is Charlotte De Witte and similar styled artists. I personally do not see how she has the platform she has and techno in general if she is the staple.&lt;br/&gt;\nCan anyone push me into some playlists or the like (Apple music preferably) that is up to date with what you think is good?&lt;br/&gt;\nI am trying to get back into production (Sorry Ableton Fans, but I am a Logic user :) ) and would like to get some inspiration.&lt;br/&gt;\nTo add, I am also a melodic techno fan, and have been listening to what has been put out lately and really dig it as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

However, most are outdated, or just say \"dive in and learn as you go\"  \n\n\nBackground: I have been learning front end development for the past 6 months or so, but to be honest, with the constant frameworks, tooling, change in needs, it is really getting distracting. To add, every framework is getting breaking changes, or in line for them. It is overwhelming when you start a course, only to have it fail on build due to issues in the codebase that isn't even a year old. I wanted to finish up React, to then learn React Native, but I honestly want to sit and focus wholeheartedly on native iOS for now. By the time I am done with the Swift foundations, from what I have heard from many, SwiftUI will be more commonplace. However:  \n\n\nWhere does one start? I know nothing about SwiftUI, so I am not sure if there are tutorials out there where things just aren't updated quick enough (Angela Yu being the main culprit here). That is more of my main concern than UIKit vs SwiftUI.  \n\n\nI know most recommend diving into SwiftUI first (I presume after going through the fundamentals of Swift itself? - just like JS and then React?), but with most apps - I presume - running on UIKit, especially for the backwards capability, would UIKit be reasonable? I heard of some things not being implemented within SwiftUI yet that one would need. Do I just cross that bridge when I get there? I would obviously over the long run learn UIKit, as it would be nothing but beneficial for ones career.   \n\n\nAfter the above wall of text, learning resources: I presume 100daysof{x} would be the best bet? How does that rate to Coding with Chris who just released the newest updated beginners course. I also see Apple themselves have the apple professional learning aimed more to highschool kids, but from what I have seen, they walk through the Swift language through videos, and mostly the Swift books from Apple themselves. Would it be more efficient to do another course over those? \n\nTL;DR: I am looking for the most up to date course for a beginner - or does the date of release not really matter in the greater scheme of things for the fundamentals? This is my main worry, purely due to what I have seen with Udemy, and having come from a relatively short background in Front End work.  I am looking at the quickest path to get up and running, where I can then delve into deeper topics from there. \n\nThank you for your patience in this. It is truly appreciated.",

Either web or software, doesn’t really matter.\nI know it is entirely possible overseas to get a position once you’ve crossed over that threshold of 40. However, we are a bit of a weird one in terms of what is the norm in the workplace. I’ve seen it in my industry and my previous work places - young and dynamic is the norm, unless in management. \nFor those in more senior positions, or even hiring managers and shot callers, do you see older folk getting jobs in tech here? Put aside the salary expectations, as that’s not a major issue as yet - covid has brought my small company to its knees and I started learning how to code last year to change over into something I enjoy and is more lucrative. I only wish I did it 20 years ago!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

They don't really explain what is happening, but just explain what they are writing verbatim. It makes learning the fundamentals difficult to understand. \n\nMy issues are coming with aspects of looping through arrays and objects and printing to a page. I am struggling to understand how to get a certain variable to print/log/etc. If there is only one value in the array, that I can do. But to get key-value pairs to print, is difficult. It's even difficult to try and put this into words, to be honest. \n\nLet's say we have 4 objects with different artists and songs (One, for example, = { 'Bush': 'Glycerine', 'Bush': 'Letting the cables sleep'}, {'Marilyn Manson': 'Coma White', 'Marilyn Manson': 'Sweet Dreams'}, {'Korn': 'Blind', 'Korn': '4U'};\n\nOne question is, print the artist's name and songs to the page. Then, print the artist, and only their second song to the page. I am lost with this. How to print both the key and the value. \n\nBottom line is, I would like to find a course or the like that spends a large amount of time on a concept. It seems that I am a slower learner than most, as everyone else grabs these concepts in a 5min lesson from Udemy and moves on while I am trying to wrap my head around them. This is also for certain aspects of JQuery and the like (on('click')) functions have me stumped a bit as well. I know JQuery is old, but it is part of their curriculum for a lightbox example. \n\nSo anyway, excuse the long post\n\nTL;DR - What is the most comprehensive JS tutorial/book/course you have found to understand the fundamentals such as functions, loops, etc.",

They are a bit expensive though coming in at $20 each per month. Nothing crazy, simple squarespace sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking at starting a personal blog in terms of writing and hopefully using it to launch my books in the future. One provider I have been told to try is ionos, another is the std GoDaddy and then HostGator. I have heard horror stories for all, with Host Gator coming in being the best in terms of service and resolved issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any others that you know of that may be best for me? I am looking at a low-cost fee with a .com reg. It will be a simple wordpress site, with minimal traffic, so shared hosting is more than what I need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Open for suggestions. Costing as well if you can, please.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a ton.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
