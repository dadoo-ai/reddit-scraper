After some reservation juggling in our itinerary we ended up being able to take The Connoisseur Tour instead of the originally planned Premium Experience, this tour is offered only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so we were lucky to fit it in. Our guide, Wee Karen, led a small group of just four, a couple from Germany, my wife and me. \n\nGlenAllachie is large and modern, a legacy from its Chivas Brothers days when most of its spirit was used for blends. But now, under the direction of Billy Walker, it's all about top-quality single malts.\n\nWe started in a cozy tasting room, trying White Heather 21 years, a whisky that Billy Walker enjoyed in his youth and later acquired as part of the distillery's purchase. We also sampled Meikle Tòir Original, hoping to snag the Turbo version, but it was sold out. A taste of their new make spirit added a unique touch to the tasting.\n\nOne unexpected twist: the distillery was temporarily halted because one of the stills had an accident. This allowed us a rare opportunity to see and touch the stills and equipment from the inside—a truly special experience for any whisky lover.\n\nGlenAllachie’s commitment to cask quality is impressive. We explored their warehouse, filled with an array of casks: ex-bourbon, ex-rye from Koval, sherry (both Oloroso and PX), port, French oak, Château Mouton barrels, Sauternes, and even Japanese Mizunara oak, which Billy Walker often samples. We were also shown some casks from Caol Ila, highlighting the practice of keeping casks from other distilleries.Tequila casks were mentioned, I asked where they were from but they couldn't tell, so I jokingly said, certainly from Mexico.\n\nDuring this trip, unlike last year in Islay, we noticed that most distilleries didn’t have cafes or restaurants, which isn't ideal when driving and the designated driver can't drink. Bars offer crisps, maybe some biscuits, and a few non-alcoholic drinks—some have coffee, others don’t.\n\nThe tasting was excellent: 17-year Solera, Moscatel single cask (my wife’s favorite), PX single cask, an ex-peated cask at 62.5% ABV, and Lum Reek 21 peated blend. We stayed at the bar afterward, trying a couple more drams, including a Chinquapin-aged Meikle Tor and a 13-year distillery exclusive single cask at 60.9% ABV. Ultimately, we brought home the Moscatel and PX single casks, even filling our own bottles—a challenging task after so many high-proof drams!\n\nGlenAllachie truly delivers an immersive and detailed tour, showcasing the craftsmanship and dedication behind their whiskies. For £60, it’s a must for any enthusiast!\n\nSlàinte!",

    "body": "This trip to Speyside was special for me because I had the chance to visit two legendary distilleries on the same day: Balvenie and Glenfiddich, both part of William Grant &amp; Sons, and within walking distance of each other and also walkable from Dufftown where we were lodging.\n\nFrom the moment I began planning the trip, I knew I wanted to do tours at both distilleries, so I patiently waited for their schedules to open. When Glenfiddich opened its bookings, I quickly reserved the Solera: Deconstructed Tour, a tour I had been looking forward to for a long time, as a fan of Glenfiddich 15-year-old. \n\nHowever, Balvenie didn't open its bookings for August, so I contacted them. They informed me that the distillery would be in \"shutdown\" for maintenance. I had almost lost hope, but after sending a few more emails, they offered me a special experience called the Shutdown Tour, which would include a visit to Balvenie Castle, the cooperage, and a tasting. I made a few adjustments to the itinerary, but it was totally worth it! \n\nBalvenie Shutdown Tour At Balvenie, we were greeted by our guide, Brian, and the group consisted of three friends from the U.S., a couple from Germany, my wife, and me. We gathered in a small room next to the gift shop, where Brian told us about the rich history of the distillery. \n\nThen we hopped on a van, which took us to the cooperage. Driving through the massive distillery campus, we saw mountains of casks, and Brian explained the variety of barrels they handle. \n\nSeeing the coopers working live was a unique experience. We got to touch the staves of bourbon barrels and sherry casks, and they showed us the tools they use. We also visited the malting floors, something that few distilleries maintain these days due to cost and effort, but Balvenie continues to use this traditional process. \n\nThen came the moment we were all waiting for: access to the famous Warehouse 24. There, Brian took out a Cooper Dog and poured whisky directly into our hands from a cask that was over 40 years old. It was almost a spiritual experience, like receiving liquid gold. \n\nAfterward, we sampled two more casks: an ex-sherry cask and an ex-bourbon cask from Jack Daniel's. Finally, we were given the chance to fill our own 200ml bottle. My wife filled hers from the bourbon cask, and I chose the sherry cask. \n\nThe tasting at the end was a highlight too. We tried five expressions of Balvenie: \n\nBalvenie 12 Year Old - The Sweet Toast of American Oak \n\nBalvenie 14 Year Old Caribbean Cask \n\nBalvenie 16 Year Old French Oak - Finished in fortified wine casks from Pineau des Charentes. \n\nBalvenie 19 Year Old - Revelation of Cask &amp; Character \n\nBalvenie 14 Year Old 2009 - A Collection of Curious Casks: This whisky was distilled just after Balvenie had used peated malt for the first time for their Week of Peat expression, so it had a slight smoky touch. \n\nSince I’m a fan of peated whiskies, I asked Brian if I could try the Week of Peat, and he happily poured me a dram. Overall, Balvenie was a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend it to any whisky lover visiting Speyside. \n\nGlenfiddich Solera: Deconstructed Tour After finishing at Balvenie, we walked over to Glenfiddich for one of the tours I had been waiting for a long time: the Solera: Deconstructed Tour. \n\nThis tour goes beyond the typical distillery experience and takes you to the famous Warehouse 8, where the solera process for the Glenfiddich 15-year-old takes place. \n\nIn this case, they marry whiskies that have been aged for at least 15 years in ex-bourbon, ex-sherry, and new American oak casks, all coming together in a massive 35,000-liter vat tun. \n\nThe key to the solera process is that the vat is never emptied completely, ensuring that part of the older whisky is always carried forward into the new blends. Seeing the vat tun from a distance was impressive, but climbing the stairs to look inside was even more exciting. The aroma that hits you when you look inside that massive vat is unforgettable—intensely beautiful and rich. \n\nAfter this, we were taken to a lab-style room with flasks and test tubes, where we were given samples of the three main components that make up the Glenfiddich 15-year-old: \n\nRefill Bourbon Cask - 54.9% ABV \n\nNew Oak Cask - 55.9% ABV \n\nSherry Cask - 61.4% ABV \n\nEach of us had the chance to create our own blend. After a lot of testing and tweaking, these were the final proportions we chose: \n\nMy blend: 75% Bourbon Cask (150 ml) 10% Sherry Cask (20 ml) 15% New Oak (30 ml) Resulting ABV: 55.7% \n\nMy wife's blend: 80% Bourbon Cask (160 ml) 15% Sherry Cask (30 ml) 5% New Oak (10 ml) Resulting ABV: 55.92% \n\nInterestingly, both my wife and I ended up with blends that had less sherry influence than the standard Glenfiddich 15-year-old. I was tempted to fill my bottle entirely with New Oak since I loved that component, but in the end, I’m happy with the balanced blend I created. \n\nIt was an incredible experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in whisky. The chance to create your own blend, see the solera process up close, and fill your own bottle is truly unforgettable.\n\nSlàinte",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m not a die-hard one-bag traveler, but my wife and I do enjoy traveling and typically do one or two international trips a year. We’re not opposed to checked luggage, especially when visiting our home country where we like to bring back a few things. Plus, I have a bit of a habit of picking up bottles of liquor when we travel, so we’re not looking to go strictly carry-on only.\n\nThat said, I do want to reduce the amount of luggage we’re hauling around, especially when navigating the metro or those lovely cobblestone streets in Europe. Last year, I bought an Osprey Farpoint 40L for a trip to Scotland. It was helpful, but I found it challenging to fit everything I wanted in there, even with the help of compression packing cubes. Since then, I've used the Farpoint for shorter trips to Mexico and within the US, but I’m gearing up for another 2-week trip to Scotland and I’m hoping to make better use of it.\n\n**My Packing List:**\n\n* **(T-shirts):**\n   * 2 short sleeve 100% cotton (black, navy blue)\n   * 3 short sleeve 60% cotton, 40% polyester (black, dark gray, white/beige)\n   * 2 long sleeve BR (burgundy, brown)\n   * 1 long sleeve Eddie Bauer (mustard)\n* **Pants:**\n   * 1 pair khaki Weatherproof (95% nylon, 5% spandex)\n   * 1 pair Banana Republic black chinos (98% cotton, 2% spandex)\n   * 2 pairs of jeans (Izod and another pair)\n* **Footwear:**\n   * Merrell hiking boots (green with orange)\n   * Johnston &amp; Murphy XC4 shoes\n* **Outerwear:**\n   * Light waterproof jacket\n   * Lightweight cardigan (planning to buy)\n* **Formal Shirts:** Planning to take at least two.\n* **Sleepwear:** Sports shorts or flannel-type pants and a loose T-shirt.\n* **Accessories:**\n   * A light sweater\n   * A scarf (planning to buy in London or Edinburgh)\n\n**Question:** What tips do you have for maximizing space in the Osprey Farpoint 40L? I’m especially interested in clothing arrangement techniques or any other hacks you’ve found helpful. I’d love to hear how others manage to fit more into this bag without feeling like they’re sacrificing too much. Thanks in advance!\n\n  \n**EDIT:** My wife and I will start our trip in London, where we’ll attend a Taylor Swift concert and do some sightseeing. We also have a lunch reservation at a fancy restaurant. Then we’ll be taking the train to Edinburgh, where we have tickets for the Military Tattoo one night and plan to wander around the Fringe Festival the next day.\n\nThe rest of our trip will be spent in the Speyside whisky region, visiting distilleries. On our way to Speyside, we’ll stop at the Glenturret distillery for lunch at their Michelin-starred restaurant. One of the nights in Speyside, we’ll also dine at the Macallan distillery’s restaurant.\n\nSo, I probably should have clarified—by \"formal shirts,\" I meant dress shirts, maybe long sleeve button-up shirts, for the nicer restaurants and events. It’s definitely a mix of city activities and some fancier dinners.\n\nI know Speyside will likely be rainy, and I’m not sure what the terrain will be like, which is why I initially thought of bringing hiking shoes.",

I read like the popular stuff of the day, bestsellers and such, please don't judge me so hardly; I read the Harry Potter series, All the Dan Brown books and such.\n\nI never read classics, in top of my mind I read 100 years of solitude, brave new world, animal farm, a people story of the united states. Then again about classics, I thing I mostly knew what some of them 'were about', reading about the books in some blog, hearing about them from a friend that studied literature.\n\nNow in my 30's and with my technical formation, I feel the lack of humanism in my life, dunno maybe an early mid age crisis of sorts hehe.\n\nThere are a ton of famous book/authors I'd love to read, guess I always use the excuse of time, but also I kinda need/want a road-map. I'd like to read. I've been filling a wishlist that I never start to get in [amazon] (http://amzn.com/w/WJ40DVGPIE6G).\n\nSo I digress, what 30, or should it be 40 books, would you recommend to a 30 year old that doesn't read that much, is very curious but is not that focused, and is feeling lost at this point of his life, to read before turning 40?\n\nThanks!",

Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT, thanks to princedwi I&amp;#39;m going after a moto G, just need to decide between two moto G models, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Universal-Unlocked-White/dp/B00K0NS0P4\"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Universal-Unlocked-White/dp/B00K0NS0P4&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-2nd-generation-Unlocked/dp/B00MWI4IN8/ref=dp_ob_title_def\"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-2nd-generation-Unlocked/dp/B00MWI4IN8/ref=dp_ob_title_def&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She has lupus,  she was diagnosed a few years ago, she's 25 now, she's always been a party girl (sometimes that worries me), has the most upbeat personality . \n\nI know her since a year ago, we started dating and then got into a relationship a few months ago. I haven't seen any episode where the lupus gets active, so I don't know what to expect. We had this conversation the other day because she doesn't tell me anything about her lupus, but she did talk about it with a friend of mine, she said it is because she doesn't want to worry me. We agreed to be more open about that and everything else. I almost don't nothing about her lupus.\n\nWhat can I expect in the long run? I want to help her in everything I can, but I don't want to make her feel weak or dependant, she's one of the strongest more hardworking women I've ever met.

    "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started a relationship with a wonderful girl, and I do feel we can get pretty serious. She has lupus,  she was diagnosed a few years ago, she&amp;#39;s 25 now, she&amp;#39;s always been a party girl (sometimes that worries me), has the most upbeat personality . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know her since a year ago, we started dating and then got into a relationship a few months ago. I haven&amp;#39;t seen any episode where the lupus gets active, so I don&amp;#39;t know what to expect. We had this conversation the other day because she doesn&amp;#39;t tell me anything about her lupus, but she did talk about it with a friend of mine, she said it is because she doesn&amp;#39;t want to worry me. We agreed to be more open about that and everything else. I almost don&amp;#39;t nothing about her lupus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can I expect in the long run? I want to help her in everything I can, but I don&amp;#39;t want to make her feel weak or dependant, she&amp;#39;s one of the strongest more hardworking women I&amp;#39;ve ever met. How can I take care of myself to take care of her?
