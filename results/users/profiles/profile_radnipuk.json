I'm working with companies, and I continually think, \"This company isn't going to exist in 5 years, maybe less. All it will take is for that particular industry to realise they can do X and customers to see the value and pop\" (and that's just using simple AI use cases).\n\nI’m convinced that in three to five years, customers, patients, buyers, citizens will expect every serious provider to wield AI. They’ll choose the doctor who uses AI decision-support over the one who “goes by gut.” They’ll pick the insurer whose chatbot resolves a claim in minutes over the one who still pushes paper, it's going to turn into a tidal wave of change. Hey, my NHS dentist already uses AI.\n\nFor me, it's also the speed of innovation in AI. AI powers have repeatedly and spectacularly outrun predictions. This year alone, OpenAI and DeepMind got gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad 18 years sooner than experts predicted ... in 2021! By 2027, it should be possible to train a model using 1,000 times the computing resources that built GPT-4.\n\n**Francis, we know this... So what does this mean for Salesforce?**\n\nI think they have positioned themselves well(ish), technically exposing more of the underlying architecture, like the Python announcement this week, is going in the right direction. It's just been (IMO) bad marketing, showing a utopian goal without showing the stepping stones to get there. Also getting lost in the HOW of AI without understanding the WHY. But I realised at the World Tour London why 95% of the sessions were on AI, because they know for good or bad, it's only a matter of time.\n\nOn a side note, I was getting a bit frustrated with poor implementations of Agentforce and AI in general, as people rush into deployments. So, I created a [scorecard to measure AI readiness](https://score.admintoarchitect.com/aireadiness). It's still a work in progress and hasn't been announced anywhere except in this post, but if anyone has a spare 5 minutes, I would appreciate some feedback. \n\nWhat's your thoughts?",

You need to make sure you create the foundations so that your designs are going to achieve those goals of the organisation AND be able to convince different levels of the organisation that what you are proposing is the least bad solution (because you can never make it perfect), as well as of course the technical ability among many others...\n\n  \n**So... I wonder if you could help...**\n\nI've created a [Salesforce architect scorecard](https://score.admintoarchitect.com/), which tries to score people on what an Awesome Salesforce Architect may be measured against in five core areas. TBH I didn't realise how hard it would be to come up with only a few questions in each area to make it meaningful so that it would come up with something useful... Can you try it and let me know here or what you think? What questions do you think may be misleading? Are the results meaningful or too vague?  is it even worth releasing at all?\n\n  \nThe areas are:\n\n* **Customer:** Having good business acumen to understand an organizations challenges, problems and goals.\n* **Create:** Understanding the strong foundational architectural principles, practices &amp; governance while staying agile.\n* **Construct:** Understanding of the critical domains of Data, Security, System, Solution, Integration &amp; Development Lifecycle Architecture.\n* **Convince:** Your capacity to garner trust and convince diverse stakeholders effectively in your architectural options and decision-making processes.\n* **Capture:** Capture your corner of Salesforce, become influential to increase your income and have a fulfilling career. \n\nThe questions should measure someone in each of the areas and give relevant advice based on their score.\n\n**What I'll do in return...**\n\nFor everyone filling out the scorecard I'm going to be providing a Visually Impaired learner access to an Assistive Calculator for STEM.

This means that any application on the internet could impersonate Data Loader by using the same client ID. As a result, Salesforce would grant the same access permissions to this app as it does to Data Loader.
