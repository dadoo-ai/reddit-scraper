I have a house, hobbies, a loving partner, good friends. I have desires in life, but none of those include a job or the pursuit of wealth.\n\nI can appreciate the idea that work provides the means to achieve those desires, but the actual performance of work is soul destroying.\n\nI am certainly better off than alot of people, I have a well paying job and decent flexibility. I can appreciate that isn't something alot of people have. \n\nI believe I am good at my job, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it. Those aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nI vigilantly protect my private life and ensure I maintain my work life balance. I don't acknowledge corporate BS and the whole 'were a family' mentality. \n\nI work cause I have to, and I'd stop in a heartbeat if I didn't.\n\nBut what can I do? Work has become so central to the human experience, it's essential and we spend the majority of our life doing it with next to no alternative.\n\nSo here I am, consistently depressed and slogging through my only chance at life wasting it away working for company profits.\n\nHow do any of you deal with this depressing reality and existential dread?
