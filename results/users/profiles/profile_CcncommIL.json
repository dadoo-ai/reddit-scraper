Now, if the meds give me pain relief, I then have to deal with the constipation that takes four other meds to control the plug that the narcs create. The MS alone gives me brain fog and sleepiness that causes me to take stay awake meds each day. The stay awake makes my BP high so I have to take loppressor which adds to the constipation.\n\nIn short, I'm fkd coming and going. \n\nDo everything you can to stay away from narcotics. What it does to your body is terrible. I have not even touched what it does to your libido and brain activity.\nIt's a living hell",
