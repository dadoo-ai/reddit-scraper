And it keeps on getting better and better as long as the data is good. Now think about how much of our time we actually spend on social media. Our phones probably have more data about us than people who know us. Now consider that the government or even a non-government agency finds a backdoor to get all the data on the whole populations phones and keeps collecting that data. Now all they need to do is make neural networks to form connections between the type of activity and criminal records of people. Also they would have patterns on how usage changes just before a crime has been committed by people.\n\n  \nWhen you think about it this is prettt much the 1984 orvellian dystopian reality because though crime detection and prevention may be why they start doing this, you can be sure that is not all they are going to do with your data. \n\n  \nAnd an even bigger problem is you think the governnment will do it but what if it is not even the government that starts doing this.

These companies own every thing, they are the biggest shareholders of 88% of the companies on the S&amp;P 500 index. And what do they do with this sort of power? They start implementing these ESG ratings which are the major cause of the transgender movement in the USA which started around 2020 the same time blackrock decided they would know use ESG to decide which company they are going to invest in, they want to make every company adhere to their whims it is not even about money anymore.

I think that many people are unaware of the harms of this vice as i myself was just a month ago. and this ignorance is not accidental, it is designed by the powers that be. They want you to cement in your heads that masturbation is healthy and have been succesful considering my own experiences and that of others who have similarly been wronged.\n\nJust go on google right now and write a query for the harmful effects of masturbation, you will find each result either downplaying any possible risk or flat out denying that any such risk exists, \"it is completely healthy and normal\", they say, \"when it is not excessive or compulsive\" ,they say.\n\nI have also seen a lot of posts on reddit saying \"oh the problem is actually porn and not masturbation\" and that is a compete lie. its an excuse to justify their unwillingness to bring about a complete change in their life because its too drastic.\n\nDo you think not watching porn while abusing yourself makes it healthier for you? It does not, in my experience masturbation using the imagination is even more damaging because you are training yourself to get aroused with your imagination instead of a real woman. If porn is bad because you are watching woman on a screen that implies imagining those same scenarios should be worse. Not only is there no real woman in front of you, you are actually getting aroused by something that is entirely a figment of your imagination and has no grounding in real life.\n\nThey want to subdue you, make you effeminate and weak willed that is why they promote masturbation. Even on this post, on a subreddit called \"NOFAP\" mind you, you will get a stupid disclaimer by a bot saying \"we are not against masturbation\".\n\nHere are excerpts from a book from the 19th century called Sexual waste of vital energy : furnishing exhaustive information about the temptations and effect of excessive indulgence of the sexual appetite from childhood to old age, including celibacy, marriage, impotence, sterility, treatment, and remedies : compiled from twenty-seven eminent medical authorities, including Dr. William A. Hammond, Dr. Edward Martin, Dr. William Acton:-\n\n\"To fight the allurements of all vice, and of sexual vice in particular, the weapon most generally needed is not knowledge, for the majority of the victims of any vice, have a pretty clear conception and knowledge of what they ought not to do, as well as what they should do; but what they have not got, and the weapon they asia do need is,—the power of resistance.\"\n\nThis implies it was common knowledge in those times that masturbation is bad and the problem was people still were not able to restrain themselves. well the problem is worse now because people think what they are doing is actually healthy and harmless.\n\nHere's another excerpt:\n\n\"The local symptoms, in the period of boyhood at least, usually excite neither attention nor anxiety. It is commonly taught that the masturbator may be known by certain peculiarities. Thus, he is given a low, mean look, a hang-dog expression; a pallid face; hollow, watery eyes; cold, moist hands; lustreless hair; constrained, embarrassed manner; drooping shoulders: a tendency towards twitching the muscles; frequent repetitions of swallowing motions on being addressed ; weak knees; shrunken sexual organs; a timid, solitary, irritable disposition; often uncleanly in his habits; averse to all society, especially that of girls; and incapable of intellectual effort.”\n\nand this one :\n\n‘‘There is in the majority of these patients a mental perversion, a persistent dwelling on sexual subjects, which in itself is sufficient to produce local congestions. In such cases the patient must be urged to use all his strength of will to overcome this tendency, He should be advised to seek an occupation that will keep him actively employed, both mentally and physically. This part of the treatment, by far the most important, depends entirely upon the strength of purpose exhibited by the patient.”\n\nand here is one on the mental effects:\n\n\"When a child, who has once shown signs of a good memory and ' of considerable intelligence, is found to evince a greater difficulty in retaining or comprehending what he is taught, we may be sure that it does not depend upon indisposition, as he states, or idleness as is generally supposed. Moreover, the progressive derangement in his health, and falling off in his activity, and in his application, depend upon the same cause; his intellectual functions become enfeebled in the most marked manner.”Provided the vicious habit is left off, or is not long practiced, the recuperative power of nature in the boy soon repairs the mischief, which appears to act principally on the nervous system.\"\n\nhere is a link to the book if any one want to dive deeper : [https://dp.la/item/6cacacb87bbb3e94772625e0b99e4a52](https://dp.la/item/6cacacb87bbb3e94772625e0b99e4a52)\n\nBut the question we must ask ourselves is if there was a consensus among doctors on the wrongs of this habit 200 years ago, why has there been a change now? Has there been any scientific research refuting these claims. have there been any double blind studies on this topic? The answer is no. They say there is no scientific evidence to support the claims that masturbation is bad, I say there is no scientific evidence to support the claims that it is healthy either.\n\nSince there has not been any new groundbreaking discoveries on the subject it would make sense to rely on the first hand experiences of these numerous doctors who noted that masturbation has detrimental effects on men.\n\nI implore you to read this book if you still are not convinced. having a clear understanding of what is right and wrong is half the work done.

I think that many people are unaware of the harms of this vice as i myself was just a month ago. and this ignorance is not accidental, it is designed by the powers that be.

It does not, in my experience masturbation using the imagination is even more damaging because you are training yourself to get aroused with your imagination instead of a real woman. If porn is bad because you are watching woman on a screen that implies imagining those same scenarios should be worse. Not only is there no real woman in front of you, you are actually getting aroused by something that is entirely a figment of your imagination and has no grounding in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They want to subdue you, make you effeminate and weak willed that is why they promote masturbation.

First the energy is drained from the physical act but i dont think that can be that much, i think when you drain your semen the body works overtime and directs more resources towards making more of it which starves other major processes of the body making you lethargic, weak , dull or irritated and then there’s the loss of nutrients which is also not that significant probably. So in my opinion its the act of constantly creating more seed which drains masturbaters. Ofcourse i cannot prove this because there hasn’t been any research but that is my hypothesis atleast.",

And I admit I thought about sex too much. So i decided that lust would not consume my life from now on, I will not let it suck me dry and kill my motivation and dreams.

    "body": "After reading your post I have come to believe that bran is the 3 eyed crow. \n\nThink about it Coldhands says the 3 eyed crow is the last greenseer, and that he is ‘Your monster’ to Bran. \n\nWhen Bran asks Bloodraven if he is the 3EC he does not understand what Bran is talking about.\n\nLook at this passage “But,” said Bran, “he heard me.”\n“He heard a whisper on the wind, a rustling amongst the leaves. You cannot speak to him, try as you might. I know. \nThis illustrates that Bran may have a few powers that even the bloodraven does not have in that Bran can actually interact with the past instead of just watching it.\n\nThere is another passage where Bran thinks about how he imagines the Bloodraven as the 3 eyed crow when the cave is dark.\n\nSo my theory goes: Bran is the 3 eyed crow or the last greenseer. He has powers that overshadow those of the bloodraven. And I believe coldhands who is probably benjen stark is also controlled in some way by the future Bran and that Bran has had a part in a lot of big events of the past. \n\nThis was all based on actual book knowledge but if i think about the show ending and Bran becoming king. There is no way this was something the showrunners came up with on their own. This had to have come from George RR Martin so I assume Bran becomes king in the books too. But the problem with the show was that since they ran out of books to adapt they did not know how to get there and George himself might have felt that the ending he has in mind could not occur in the show due to the massive way they diverged from the books starting from the 5th season.",
