    "body": "Hoi Reddit, ik ben hier recent erg goed geholpen en wil advies inwinnen voor mijn buurvrouw. Ik 33M zij 29M. Ik woon hier nu zelf 2 jaar, en deze buurvrouw heeft mij altijd geholpen met de plantjes tijdens vakanties ect, ik zou voor haar hier graag wat terug doen, omdat dit haar enorm stress oplevert. Ze komt uit Aruba, hier gestudeerd en gebleven, en dreigt nu haar sociale woning te verliezen, zonder familie / vrienden / vangnet.\n\n# Tijdlijn:\n\n**26 augustus 2016**Betrekt woning in Rotterdam met haar vriend (ingeschreven BRP), vriend als hoofdbewoner, zij als mede bewoner (nooit over nagedacht.\n\n**07 juni 2021 - 30 augustus 2021**Ze hebben een breakup en gaat kort ergens anders wonen (helaas schrijft ze zich ook daar in in BRP).\n\n**30 augustus 2021 - tot heden**Terug in de woning (ingeschreven in BRP).\n\n**21 februari 2022**Doet aanvraag voor medehuurderschap, wordt afgewezen (niet 2 jaar 'aaneengesloten' samenwonend). Doet daarna een verzoek tot huisbewaring, waar de woningstichting niet met een reactie komt.\n\n**23 maart 2022**Definitieve breakup en haar vriend verlaat het land (uitgeschreven in BRP, maar niet bij de woning).\n\n**24 januari 2024**Mijn buurvrouw doet weer een verzoek tot 'medehuurderschap' om haar status als medebewoner te verhogen en meer rechten te ontvangen.\n\n**06 februari 2024**Ze heeft een thuiswerk dag en er wordt aangebeld, onaangekondigd bezoek van 2 mensen van de woning stichting. Ze vragen of ze mogen binnenkomen en mijn buurvrouw ontvang ze. Deze personen lieten de BRP van mijn buurvrouw en haar ex-vriend zien en zeiden dat ze geen recht had op medehuurderschap omdat haar vriend sinds maart 2022 uitgeschreven is.\n\nDeze personen hebben gevraagd of ze foto's mogen maken, en hebben het hele huis, inclusief alle lades van de kasten gefotografeerd. Ze hebben haar ook ondervraagt naar haar relatie, hierop heeft ze geantwoord 'het is aan en uit en hij is af en toe in NL'.\n\nZe was redelijk overrompeld / voelde druk door deze mensen. Deze personen hebben meerdere malen genoemd dat ze/hun fraudeurs waren, strafbaar bezig zijn en dat haar 'vriend' moet opzeggen en ze een maand heeft om eruit te gaan. Mijn buurvrouw werd nogal emotioneel door de situatie, en vervolgens heeft de woning consulent gezegd dat ze een per direct een samenvatting moet emailen.\n\nVervolgens heeft de woonconsulent (met toestemming) de telefoon van mijn buurvrouw genomen, via haar email een samenvatting voor haar getypt en verstuurd. Ik heb deze email gelezen en dat is natuurlijk typische gemaakt 'ik weet dat xxxx maar ik zou graag willen blabla' waarin die woonconsulent haar juridisch klem zet (neem ik aan).\n\nDe woonconsulente heeft aangegeven dat ze op donderdag (vandaag) met een reactie zou komen nadat ze overlegd zou hebben met een jurist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Bulletpoints:\n\n* \\- Het is een kleine appartement in Rotterdam, 1 slaap kamer, mini bijkamertje, badkamer en woonkamer. (zelfde als mijn woning) precies goed voor 1 persoon, 2 personen zou kunnen. 60 m2\n* \\- Deze buurvrouw betaald de huur via een gezamelijke en/of rekening, maar betaald zelf 100%. Nooit een betaling gemist.\n* \\- De woning stichting is vorig jaar overgenomen door een andere woningstichting.\n* \\- De 'nieuwe' woning stichting zegt niets van het huisbewaring verzoek te kunnen zien (mijn buurvrouw heeft wel bewijs van ingediend verzoek\n* \\- Er zijn vluchten van haar exvriend naar Nederand geweest sinds uitschrijven\n* \\- Er zijn/waren geen mannespullen/kleren op de foto's\n* \\- Praktisch gezien (met korte onderbreking) woont ze daar sinds 2016, heeft goede banden met de inwoners van het complex, doet wat extra voor een aantal ouderen hier.\n* \\- Ze verdient nu 700 euro boven het maximale bruto jaarinkomen voor sociale huur.\n* \\- Ze heeft in 2017/2018 in de bewonerscommissie gezeten\n\nOmdat ze oprecht geen plek heeft om te gaan wanneer ze uit huis gezet gaat worden wil ik haar graag helpen, ondersteunen hierin. Hetzij met advies, financieel voor juridisch en uiteindelijk opvangen als dat nodig blijkt te zijn.\n\n# Next steps:\n\n* \\- Heb haar aangegeven nu even geen vragen direct te beantwoorden en alles via de email te laten verlopen, gezien hoe de woning stichting dit aanpakt.\n* \\- Verder verzamelen van documenten\n* \\- Juridsich loket bellen voor advies (ik zie dat dat alleen voor 'laag' inkomen is, dus ben benieuwd)\n* \\- Wat informatie inwinnen via mijn netwerk waar een gepensioneerde woonconsulent inzit\n\n# Vragen:\n\n1. \\- Wat mag de woningstichting qua:\n   1. Op medehuurderschap geen reactie, direct huisbezoek.\n   2. Foto's maken (er is akkoord gegeven), en hoe moeten/mogen ze dit bewaren (GDPR)?\n   3. Een email schrijven via de telefoon van mijn buurvrouw en zo woorden in haar mond leggen? (moeten we hier een reply op sturen dat dit niet direct de text van mijn buurvrouw is?)\n2. \\- Ik heb me ingelezen in medebewoner, medehuurder, hoofdbewoner en het ziet er niet goed uit voor haar. Wat is de duratie van zo'n traject voordat ze er echt uit moet?\n3. Ze heeft geen 'laag inkomen' maar tegenwoordig met een auto om naar werk te gaan en alleenwonend blijft er niet veel over, de enige route die ze heeft is betaalde juridische hulp? Ik kom een hoop bedrijven tegen die 'hulp loketten' lijken maar een funnel zijn voor hun advocaten kantoor (wat prima is), maar zijn bepaalde keurmerken waar ik naar kan kijken voordat ik iemand inhuur? \n4. \\- Heeft 'in onderhandeling' gaan met de woningstichting zin? Kan ik hier met hun en een goed gesprek uitkomen of moeten hun ook policy volgens en gaat dat nooit lukken?\n5. \\- Wat is globaal het stappenplan / policy van de woningstichting? Wat zijn de uitzonderingen?\n6. \\- Wat voor verzoeken kunnen wij bij deze woningstichting indienen voor meer informatie? (als hun geen huisbewaring verzoek in systeem hebben staan, en wij bewijs, kan dat down the line ergens helpen?)\n7. \\- Wat verwacht de woningstichting waar ze gaat wonen als ze uit huis moet? De woningmarkt is (hier) bizar op het moment.\n\nIk heb geprobeerd om dit zo uitgebreid doch bondig op te schrijven en zal dit vandaag nog een aantal keren herzien/formatteren zodat het makkelijker gelezen kan worden. Voor de mensen die mijn advies hebben geven na een altercatie met een BOA op Utrecht CS, ik heb niets meer vernomen van mijn aangifte en/of klacht bij NS.\n\nVragen/opmerkingen/advies welkom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Na een paar minuten dat deze man buiten is met zijn fiets, waar 8 handhavers passief staan te kijken en niemand de man echt helpt, loop ik richting de deur en vraag ik de handhavers om de trein los te laten voor vertrek omdat we naar huis willen. Ik sprak net te vroeg, want de deuren sluiten terwijl ik het vraag.*\n\n*Ik neem weer plaats en ze houden opnieuw de trein tegen, 4 man komt naar binnen, de alfa van de groep eist dat ik naar buiten stap, ik vraag \"waarom, dit is de laatste trein, wat is de reden?\". Hij eist het opnieuw, zonder reden, en ik ben in de war, het gaat erg snel en het lijkt erg drastisch voor mijn eerder verzoek om te vertrekken. Bij de 3e keer voegt hij toe dat hij geweld gaat gebruiken,  ik sta op met de bak shoarma in mijn handen.*\n\n*Hier escaleert het en pakt hij mij vast, smijt mij door de trein, shoarma door de lucht op mensen. Ik beland tussen de treinstoelen aan de andere kant, een collega van hem ligt onder mij, houdt mijn armen vast, en hij zit met zijn knie in mijn buik en knijpt met 1 hand mijn strot dicht. Hij roept \"GA JE NU MEEWERKEN JA OF NEE, GEEF ANTWOORD!\". Ik wilde antwoorden, maar kon letterlijk geen lucht over mijn stembanden halen. Mijn mond zat nog vol shoarma, en na een halve minuut dump ik dat uit mijn mond omdat ik naar lucht wil gaan happen zodra hij mijn strot los laat, ik voel mijn hoofd rood worden en begin langzaam in paniek te raken. Dit interpreteert de agressor als \"eten spugen\" en geeft mij een pak rammel, een aantal ellebogen in het gezicht en knietjes in de zij.*\n\n*Ze gooien mij uit de trein het perron op en springen met een aantal op me, knietjes in de rug en worstelen wat met mijn armen om mij te boeien. Ik heb al die tijd niet tegengewerkt of gestribbeld, maar hun hebben mij alle kanten op getrokken en \"MEEWERKEN\" geroepen.*\n\n*Ik lig nu op het perron, de trein vertrekt en er zit 1 handhaver met zijn knie in mijn nek en de overige 7 staan om mij heen. Het is muis stil, ik ben op adem gekomen en vraag de mensen om mij heen wat er nu aan de hand is, of er iemand uitleg kan geven, of er een aanleiding is, en wat de next steps zijn. Niemand antwoord, de agressor zegt dat ik hun beledigde, ik vraag om de belediging, geen antwoord.., maar ik heb wel hun werk belemmerd. Hoe? Geen antwoord.., maar omdat ik erop door vraag heb ik nu ook \"geweld tegen NS personeel\" erbij gekregen, alsof hij een menu samenstelt.*\n\n*Ik raak gefrustreerd, en begin nu te mopperen en ik zeg dat hij een mietje is en dat hij moet leren de-escaleren. Ik vertel hem dat zijn vader trots op hem zal zijn. Deze laatste opmerking triggert een emotie in hem, hij komt op mij af stormen (ik nog geboeid op de grond met een BOA op mij). Hij ziet wit voor zijn ogen, zijn collega's houden hem tegen, en een goede minuut is hij aan het worstelen met collega's om erlangs te komen om mij aan te vallen.*\n\n*Hij schreeuwt \"Ik kan in de systemen je adres zoeken, ik kom bij je langs en ga je dood maken!\"*\n\n*De politie arriveert eindelijk en neemt mij mee naar het bureau. Ze luisteren naar mijn verhaal, beloven naar de camera beelden te kijken en de betreffende handhaver naar het bureau te halen voor overleg.*\n\n*Een uur later haalt de agent mij uit de cel, en zegt \"Je hebt gelijk, je verhaal klopt, we hebben de perron beelden gezien\". Ik vraag hem wat de handhaver heeft verteld. Hij antwoordt \"Dat je gelijk hebt\".*\n\n*De politie vertelde eerder dat ik mogelijk de nacht zou moeten blijven, dat ze me nu naar buiten laten maakt mij erg blij, en ik krijg mijn spullen terug en loop met de agent naar buiten. Onderweg biedt hij 100x zijn excuses aan en dat hun de situatie niet weten voordat ze me oppikten. Ik vertelde dat ze netjes hun werk gedaan hebben en bedank ze.*\n\n*Ik kon niet meer thuis komen, dus moest een collega bellen of ik daar kon slapen, en de volgende ochtend naar huis gereisd.*\n\n*- Horloge kapot*\n\n*- Tand door mijn lip (hele lip is dik)*\n\n*- Nek pijn*\n\n*- Rib waarschijnlijk gebroken (morgen foto op verzoek dokter)*\n\n*- Enorme rugpijn*\n\n*- Kaak voelt 'ontzet'*\n\n*- Strottenhoofd doet zeer, grote blauwe plekken op mijn hals en nagel krassen (dokter adviseer tetanus prik)*\n\n*- Overhemd is gesloopt*\n\n*- Op werk is het redelijk mis gelopen met 2 belangrijke meetings en zal ik nog moeten zien wat voor impact dit heeft op deze projecten, de deadlines en mijn performance in november. (werd wakker in Utrecht met dikke lip, kapot overhemd, geen andere kleren, kon niet de meetings attenderen).*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Bovenstaande is ook vastgesteld door de dokter en gearchiveerd, en ik heb er foto's van gemaakt.*\n\n\\-------------\n\nIk ben hier redelijk van geschrokken. Altijd vechtsport gedaan, dus de 'schade' maakt mij niet zoveel uit, ik heb mij  gelukkig in kunnen houden en niets terug gedaan. Toen ik jonger was zou ik in deze gevallen wel terug vechten, omdat je echt in zo'n survivalmode komt. Daar ben ik trots op. Ik maak mij meer zorgen dat zoiets ook zou gebeuren met een ander zwakker persoon, en dan zijn de gevolgen misschien heel anders.\n\nAangifte lijkt mij ook redelijk gepast, maar twijfel nog wel een beetje. Ik verliet niet direct de trein na de eerste of tweede sommering van de handhaver. En had ik ze wel degelijk aangesproken om dingen af te ronden zodat we konden vertrekken.\n\nIk ben wel benieuwd naar de body cam footage, omdat ze 8 handhavers waren zal er vast wel iets aangestaan moeten hebben? Ik merk dat het ook een beetje een stigma in mijn kringen van \"Je zal het wel verdiend hebben\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ik heb de volgende vragen:**\n\n\\- Zouden jullie aangifte doen?\n\n\\- Heb ik recht om die body cam footage te zien/krijgen?\n\n\\- Zou hij mijn horloge / overhemd moeten kunnen gaan betalen?\n\n\\- Moet ik direct de trein verlaten bij een sommering handhaver zonder vermelding van een reden?\n\n\\- Kan de opmerking \"Kunnen jullie het afronden, zodat we kunnen gaan\" worden gezien als een belediging en/of aanleiding?\n\n\\- Hoe wordt zo'n bedreiging gezien? Dat hij mijn adres gaat opzoeken, en mij dood komt maken? Ik ben niet bang aangelegd, maar hij kan waarschijnlijk wel echt mijn adres op zoeken?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:Wow, ik ben oprecht een beetje overrompeld van de reacties, de post was eerst niet goedgekeurd door een autospam filter, dus de avond weggegaan denkende dat ik deze post niet online zou komen en ik het daarbij zou laten. Zoals eerder gezegd, twijfelde ik een beetje omdat ik mij niet wil 'aanstellen' als je iets 'verdiend' heb. Maar ik denk bijvoorbeeld ook aan die jongen die de helft van die bak shoarma over hem heen kreeg. Misschien was die beste gast wel onderweg naar zijn eerste date? Wat een ellende.\n\nIk heb besloten dat alle adviezen hier op te volgen en dus alle lijntjes uit te zetten en zoveel mogelijk impact te maken op dit persoon, niet zozeer voor mijzelf maar voor alle reizigers (ook de soms eigenwijze!).\n\nIk ben het met jullie eens dat mijn acties ook zeker niet handig waren!\n\nIk ben vandaag terug gegaan naar datzelfde politie bureau om aangifte te doen, dat kon daar niet op locatie en ze hebben mij naar huis gestuurd omdat ik daarvoor online een afspraak voor moest maken, en dit bij een bureau in Rotterdam kon gaan doen. Thuis gebeld, en zit nu te wachten op een terugbelactie (geen idee wanneer?), ik zou anoniem gebeld worden en dan een afspraak in kunnen plannen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\n22-08-2023\n\nVoicemail gekregen van Politie Rotterdam afgelopen zaterdag, dat ze het toch fijner zouden vinden als ik aangifte zou doen in Utecht omdat het daar gebeurd is en er handhaving mee speelt. Ik moet wachten tot ik door Utrecht gebeld wordt voor een afspraak om langs te komen om aangifte te doen. Het is nu Dinsdag en ik heb nog niet de mogelijkheid gehad om aangifte te doen. Ik ben ook door NS klachten service nog niet teruggebeld met terugkoppeling. Ik ben bang dat zodra de instanties gaan bewegen dat de camera beelden al verdwenen zijn.\n\nOok kwam ik vanochtend de vrouwelijke handhaver tegen die mijn verzoek een vrouw te helpen negeerde en erbij was toen dit gebeurde. Ik heb haar aangesproken met de vraag hoe dingen normaal werken, en of ze alle 8 een rapport moeten schrijven van afgelopen donderdag (ze herkende me direct), ze deed een beetje vaag en zei dat alleen degene die mij arresteert een rapport moet schrijven (de agressor dus in dit geval).\n\nGrote kans dus dat ik de Turkse man die mij belaagde dus weer tegen ga komen op Utrecht CS, ik ben niet bang voor hem, alleen vraag ik me af of ik me kan inhouden hem aan te spreken en op een fatsoenlijke manier vragen te stellen, ik denk dat het me niet veel zal helpen, maar ik ben gewoon benieuwd wat hij er zelf van vindt.

Now I arrived in Australia and trying to land a sales job here to up my English game and get some diversification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a phone interview on Monday for the following job offer:&lt;a href=\"https://www.seek.com.au/job/37671154?tracking=TMC-SAU-eDM-SharedJob-13246\"&gt;https://www.seek.com.au/job/37671154?tracking=TMC-SAU-eDM-SharedJob-13246&lt;/a&gt; I am not sure if it is an awesome sales job but I am willing to take it cause it is hard as a backpacker to find a decent job around here (employer is restricted to work with me for 6 months only).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spoke to them about my WHV (working holiday visum) and they weren&amp;#39;t interested because of the 6 months rule. She just called back and said they maybe want to move forward anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phone interview on Monday, what can I expect? Any quick tips to prepare? Does this Job looks like timeshare selling?Never have been in a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am reading this sub for years, love the support you guys give each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
