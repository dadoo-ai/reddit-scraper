    "body": "This past weekend, I took the International Coaching Federation's credentialing exam for the Associate Coaching Certificate and passed. It was challenging because there is no memorizing. It's all frameworks and concepts based.\n\nIf anybody has questions reg the preparation process (except the actual questions coz they are a blur now lol), happy to answer.\n\n  \nI realize a common question (obviously) is how i prepared. So updating my OP to include this:\n\nWhat I did to prepare:\n\n1. Watched lot of coaching demonstration videos online. For example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrt4siWCsFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrt4siWCsFI)\n\n2. Memorized and internalized the 8 ICF core competencies, and did the free 8 question practice exam from ICF. There are many YouTube videos that go over these. I also watched the 8 part series from ICF itself: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxYhGVI2h0&amp;list=PLMBtOVpaN5DjRt-VAJIa0Xe0MLuA-LZNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxYhGVI2h0&amp;list=PLMBtOVpaN5DjRt-VAJIa0Xe0MLuA-LZNk)\n\n3. Found these frameworks as well - ACCAT and TRAPS, and how to use look at coaching situations through their lens [https://www.facebook.com/groups/ICFCredentialJourneys/posts/2627582100755516/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ICFCredentialJourneys/posts/2627582100755516/)\n\n4.
