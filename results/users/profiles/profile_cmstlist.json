At very few points did any notable songs jump out at me. S2 is not dropping on Crave until later this month so I decided to jump the gun and grab it from the high seas. The episodes were clearly sourced from the BBC as per watermark. The soundtrack immediately jumped out at me in episode 1, like the whole process of each boy walking to meet up and then kiss and then the aftermath had a good 4-5 songs played per pair. And I thought, \"wow they must have really upped their music budget for Season 2\". I rewatched the first meet-kiss scene from S1E1 on Crave and, yeah, just generic music.\n\nThen I thought, wait a moment, is this another case of syndication breaking the music licensing? So I went looking for S1E1 from other sources. One copy from Paramount+ (Australia?) sounded just like the Crave version. Then I tried using a VPN to watch S1E1 direct from iPlayer. Boom! Totally different soundtrack, music all over the place. Wow, what a difference it makes.\n\nSo anyway just wanted to let you know, if you are watching this show from a non-UK source, you are experiencing a \"copyright-censored\" soundtrack with mostly generic music.",

    "body": "In the past month or so I've been finding my Fibe TV box getting more and more frustrating. Main points I'm noticing:\n\n* **Random large skips.** For example:\n   * I am watching a 30-minute show where the commercial breaks are about 2.5 minutes. I press the 30s seek ahead button five times, one at a time. The first 4 seeks correctly skip 30s each. But the fifth skip, the UI freezes up for a few seconds, and then suddenly lurches ahead 10 minutes or so.\n   * I seek through the commercial break and overshoot slightly. So I press the 7s seek back button a few times. Then I notice that instead it sent me way way back, like several minutes or even into the prior commercial break before this one.\n* **Periodically unresponsive to the remote.** Sometimes I am watching a show or in the midst of trying to skip back/ahead, and it suddenly stops responding to all remote presses for anywhere from 5-30 seconds. This is even worse in combination with the random large skips, cause I might get sent to a portion of the show that spoils me about a part I haven't watched yet, and then the unresponsiveness means I can't pause or rewind away from it.\n* **Closed captions randomly drop out.** This is often after seeking through commercials. The CC button still appears to be highlighted but no captions show up. Unselecting and reselecting CC does not always work. Often it requires backing out of the playback and then resuming the show again.\n\nEDIT for one more: **Disappearing timers**. I set something up to record more than a week in advance. In the days leading up to it I check and I see it is still a scheduled recording. And then on the day of... what the heck, where did it go? I think this may be related to situations where the program listing gets updated in the hours or days before it airs. But Bell is not handling it in any graceful sort of way so I get this nasty surprise where my recording simply doesn't happen despite my best efforts.\n\nAnyone else finding it getting worse and worse?",

This is even worse in combination with the random large skips, cause I might get sent to a portion of the show that spoils me about a part I haven&amp;#39;t watched yet, and then the unresponsiveness means I can&amp;#39;t pause or rewind away from it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closed captions randomly drop out.&lt;/strong&gt; This is often after seeking through commercials. The CC button still appears to be highlighted but no captions show up. Unselecting and reselecting CC does not always work. Often it requires backing out of the playback and then resuming the show again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT for one more: &lt;strong&gt;Disappearing timers&lt;/strong&gt;. I set something up to record more than a week in advance. In the days leading up to it I check and I see it is still a scheduled recording. And then on the day of... what the heck, where did it go? I think this may be related to situations where the program listing gets updated in the hours or days before it airs. But Bell is not handling it in any graceful sort of way so I get this nasty surprise where my recording simply doesn&amp;#39;t happen despite my best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else finding it getting worse and worse?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This is in northern NB, across Chaleur Bay from the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec.\n\nNow, this leads me to some nitpicks... and to be sure I'm just saying this for fun, but I enjoy thinking about these kinds of details:\n\n* Bathurst is a very bilingual town, about evenly split between francophone and anglophone. You would think if Port Haven is near Bathurst, then you'd hear a bit more French in town rather than none at all.\n* Landry is a reasonably common **francophone** surname in NB and Québec. In particular it is more of an **Acadian** name. Both NB and Québec have had many politicians named Landry. Québec had a premier Bernard Landry 2001-2003 from a region of PQ that has a lot of Acadians. There are of course anglophone Landry families too, but their ancestry typically goes back to francophone Acadians at some point. In fact 1814 is only 1-2 generations after Acadians were formally allowed to return to Acadia after their expulsion between 1755-1764. So you'd think that you'd have heard some Landrys in 1814 Port Haven speaking French, right?\n* February 17, 2000... what do you think the weather would have been like in northern New Brunswick? We actually don't have to guess, we can look it up [here](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html). According to the Bathurst A monitoring station, the warmest recorded temperature was at 7AM, -7.6 Celsius. And then it actually got **colder** during the day, reaching -14.5C at high noon and -17.7C by 7PM. Brrr! \n   * Would the pond be totally frozen over? I guess we should check how many days it's been below zero. Turns out the last high above 0 was 8 days ago on February 9. Damn, that ice is bound to be frozen solid.\n   * And even if it wasn't (does the pond produce magic geothermal heat to keep time travel alive?), almost certainly anyone stepping out of a pond soaking wet on that day would have noticed the water on their skin and clothing starting to freeze solid. Colton's sweater looks warm but it's certainly not enough.\n   * Wow, apparently 3 days earlier there was 29 cm of snowfall. Considering it's been freezing outside since then, you'd think we'd have even the tiniest hint of snow in this scene!\n\nOK I'm done. I'm that kind of nerd who had the Nitpicker's Guide to Star Trek on my bedside shelves as a kid, so I'm bound to do this kind of thing 🤣\n\n",

I saw Coast Capital had a 5% bonus interest promo through end of April so I set up an account with them.\n\nDuring the period where my account was already activated but the debit card was still in the mail, I looked into methods of linking the account to other banks. Similar to with Wealthsimple, Coast mainly uses Flinks for this.\n\nI'm aware that a \"push\" is better than a \"pull\" because there won't be a hold period, but I was unable to quickly set up a \"push\" link from Simplii to Coast. So I did a push from Simplii to Wealthsimple. From Wealthsimple I set up via Flinks a connection to the Coast Savings account, and after testing successfully with a small amount I sent a significant sum to the Coast Savings account. (I have plenty more in another account, but this is definitely a non-negligible amount.)\n\nAnyway later in Feb my Coast card &amp; PIN finally arrived. This is when I discovered that although I could activate my card, the accounts are totally frozen, both chequing &amp; savings. Any attempt to move money out of either account (ATM, bill payment, transfer) results in an error, on every platform (ATM, mobile, desktop). In fact, the **customer support agents themselves** are also getting this error when they try to move any of my funds.\n\nI've been in contact with their team every single day since last Wednesday. I have so far started a complaint with their internal process and been escalated to a supervisor contact. However the only answer I'm getting back day after day is that it's an IT issue, and that they still have no further updates. They have told me some automatic lock may have triggered when I first funded the account, but it's already been taken off, and now they don't know why they can't unfreeze my account.\n\nAt this point I'm starting to get worried that this could become more than a one-week problem. What if it's a six-week problem? What if at the end of April I still can't get my money out and I'm not even earning an interest bonus? What if I want to put this money towards a down payment in April?\n\nAny thoughts on what I should be doing other than constantly hammering the bank's support process? Should I be going up to the OBSI? Is there a point where I should be considering legal action? Cause at some point \"it's an IT issue\" is just not an acceptable answer... what do I do when a bank tells me they literally don't know how to get my money back to me?",

    "body": "For anyone who's watched *Doctor Who*, the recurring character River Song is notable for appearing \"out of order\". The sequence in which the main cast experiences meeting her is totally different from the order in which she experiences it. This includes occasions where we meet her at an earlier point in her life after already having seen how she dies. It occurred to me that Colton is very much like that with respect to both his time travels and the travellers he meets.\n\nUntil now, all our modern-era Landrys have mostly been experiencing the time periods they visit in a unidirectional way... if any of them jump back to a time period it is almost always after the last time any of them jumped to that period. (Only exceptions I can think of include Alice's visit to mail Del's letter, and Elliot jumping in with Alice to see Colton.) But Colton himself is untethered from this sequence. Here's what I believe we know so far:\n\nIn 1965, as a child he first ~~meets~~ encounters Katherine when she saves him from the pond, which she experiences at the end of S3E6. (EDIT: This was an encounter but Colton did not see her. Evie did.)\n\nIn 1974 as a teenager, presumably before Rick's death, he jumps in the pond and meets Elijah, Susanna and Jacob, from a point in Jacob's timeline prior to Katherine's first S2 visit. He has no reason to know at this point that Jacob is a time traveller or his own son; he probably takes Elijah at his word that Jacob is his son.\n\nNext, he meets Alice on her first S3E2 visit. After this visit Rick dies.\n\nOn the day of Rick's funeral, Colton jumps into the pond hoping to do something about it but lands in 1816 instead. This is the second time he crosses paths with each of Katherine and Jacob, but this is the visit they made in S3E8. He saves Jacob from the house fire. Then he jumps back to 1974 and meets Alice again on her second visit that spans from the end of S3E2 into E3.\n\nFrom this point onwards Colton crosses paths with Alice (and coexists with Kat's visits but I think doesn't meet her) throughout the remainder of their S3 visits to 1974.\n\nWe don't know anything else from here to 1999, other than the fact that Colton &amp; Del get married and have the kids. So he proceeds to \"meet\" Kat at her birth, and Jacob at his birth, and raises them with Del.\n\nIn 1999, Alice and Elliot visit from S2E10 but Colton doesn't see her, and a wet Elliot shows up at the farm. (I'm unsure if this visit is before Alice's first S1 visit or not?) He does not seem surprised in the least to have a sopping wet grown man show up on the farm looking emotional. It's quite likely he already knows this is Elliot.\n\nIn 1999 he meets Alice *again*, but younger, from her S1 visits. He surely also recognizes that the young woman who shows up wet must be a time traveller, because she hasn't aged in 25 years. He also meets Katherine a handful of times. We are not sure if he recognizes her from 1816 or *My Katherine* at any point from here until his death.\n\nSomewhere in this final chapter of his life we also have the yet-unexplained scene where he goes back in time and watches his slightly younger self with Jacob. It is not entirely out of the question that the Colton who died was actually visiting from further in the future.\n\nAfter Colton's death, Alice continues to visit throughout S1 &amp; S2.",

But once it has been brought to their proper attention, the effects of the filter fade out.\n\nThis is what I'm thinking could be the easiest explanation to \"why did **character** not notice later in their life that they'd seen **traveller** before\"? For example, both Del and Kat see and interact with Alice repeatedly during Kat's teenage years, yet neither of them notice when Alice grows up to look exactly like that girl they used to know. They don't clue in until they explicitly learn that time travel was happening. Even adult Nick, who sees teenage Alice and remarks that she looks so much like \"his\" Alice, can only let it get that far.\n\nSo what we have here is a retroactive perception filter, that acts to try and prevent paradoxes that could occur from people recognizing a traveller before they should. The pond's power is not just to send people where they need to be, but also to protect people when they don't need to be recognized. E.g. in the years between the last time young Kat saw Alice, and the day that Kat learns about time travel, Kat's memories memories of young Alice are misdirected by the pond's perception filter.

So maybe there&amp;#39;s some sort of a routing issue that depends also on what phone system the destination number is using.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else run into this before?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I did that, entered the new numbers in my spreadsheet, and... **now I was $2000 underweight** in US equities.\n\nWhat the... ?\n\nAfter much head-scratching and re-checking my spreadsheet I finally figured out what was wrong. When I checked my new cash &amp; shares balances after the first sell, I must have caught the app at a bad moment in the refresh cycle. It was not showing the final balance after all shares were sold, rather it seems to have sold in two slices and I was seeing the share balance **after only some of the shares had been sold**, and then typed the wrong number in my spreadsheet.\n\nSo in the end I had to turn around and buy those 23 shares back.

I checked my new balance of cash and shares in the app, entered them into my spreadsheet and... was baffled to find out that my US equities still appeared to be $2000 overweight in my portfolio. Huh?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I ran a new calculation and said, OK, I guess I need to sell 23 more shares. I did that, entered the new numbers in my spreadsheet, and... &lt;strong&gt;now I was $2000 underweight&lt;/strong&gt; in US equities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the... ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After much head-scratching and re-checking my spreadsheet I finally figured out what was wrong. When I checked my new cash &amp;amp; shares balances after the first sell, I must have caught the app at a bad moment in the refresh cycle. It was not showing the final balance after all shares were sold, rather it seems to have sold in two slices and I was seeing the share balance &lt;strong&gt;after only some of the shares had been sold&lt;/strong&gt;, and then typed the wrong number in my spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the end I had to turn around and buy those 23 shares back. Except I had to pay 13¢/share more than I sold them for. I guess I should consider the $2.99 &amp;quot;tuition&amp;quot;... &lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to purposely refresh the app after an order fills, or you might get wrong/partial numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "body": "**EDIT, later in the day Oct 1:** After a 32-day odyssey, Simplii \"finallii\" activated my savings account 😅\n\nSome reflections on my experience with Simplii so far:\n\n* Signing up for their credit card was actually relatively smooth. This was the first business I did with them.\n* Once I had the credit card, in late August I followed a link from my account to register for the 6.25% savings account promo. Little did I know, their website has a bug in which it has **no idea how to link an application to your existing customer profile**. The result was that my application got fully ignored because it was treated as a duplicate application.\n* I didn't discover the above until several weeks later when I phoned in to ask why I hadn't heard back on my application. The agent had no other option but to do the application as a phone interview. This phone call took **35 dull minutes of my time** slowly answering the same questions I had already filled out online 3 weeks earlier.\n* The agent did a **hard credit pull** for opening a savings account ?!??\n* My 5-month promo started on a day on which I had no actual way to access the account yet or move any money into it. CSR says there is no way to advance the start date to the actual activation date of the account.\n* I had to wait for 3 separate pieces of snail mail: the card, the PIN and a signature panel.\n* I snail-mailed in the signature panel and nothing happened in a week. I phoned in and was told I sent in a blank. I have no idea if this is true or not, but I swear I remember signing it. I am told another signature panel has been snail-mailed to me. It has yet to arrive.\n* The agent I spoke to on a call sent me a secure message with a new electronic copy of the signature panel. I signed it electronically.\n* I called back a few days later and was told I had to print it and sign it. So now I have printed and signed it and sent the photo in electronically.\n* Simplii's policy is that if you say **anything negative about Simplii** during a call, they **must log it as a complaint**. No exceptions. So far 3 complaints have been logged on my behalf even though two of them were not ones I asked them to log. This process slows down any phone call you are on.

This was the first business I did with them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once I had the credit card, in late August I followed a link from my account to register for the 6.25% savings account promo. Little did I know, their website has a bug in which it has &lt;strong&gt;no idea how to link an application to your existing customer profile&lt;/strong&gt;. The result was that my application got fully ignored because it was treated as a duplicate application.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t discover the above until several weeks later when I phoned in to ask why I hadn&amp;#39;t heard back on my application. The agent had no other option but to do the application as a phone interview. This phone call took &lt;strong&gt;35 dull minutes of my time&lt;/strong&gt; slowly answering the same questions I had already filled out online 3 weeks earlier.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The agent did a &lt;strong&gt;hard credit pull&lt;/strong&gt; for opening a savings account ?!??&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My 5-month promo started on a day on which I had no actual way to access the account yet or move any money into it. CSR says there is no way to advance the start date to the actual activation date of the account.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I had to wait for 3 separate pieces of snail mail: the card, the PIN and a signature panel.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I snail-mailed in the signature panel and nothing happened in a week. I phoned in and was told I sent in a blank. I have no idea if this is true or not, but I swear I remember signing it. I am told another signature panel has been snail-mailed to me. It has yet to arrive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The agent I spoke to on a call sent me a secure message with a new electronic copy of the signature panel. I signed it electronically.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I called back a few days later and was told I had to print it and sign it. So now I have printed and signed it and sent the photo in electronically.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Simplii&amp;#39;s policy is that if you say &lt;strong&gt;anything negative about Simplii&lt;/strong&gt; during a call, they &lt;strong&gt;must log it as a complaint&lt;/strong&gt;. No exceptions. So far 3 complaints have been logged on my behalf even though two of them were not ones I asked them to log. This process slows down any phone call you are on. In other words if you say anything negative you are punished by having to endure a longer phone call.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyway, it&amp;#39;s been 32 days since I applied for this savings account and it&amp;#39;s still not activated.

The end result is that I placed all 5 orders and did not get the final coupon as promised. This was false advertising - I would not have placed some of those orders if it were not for this promotion, so they induced me to order on false pretenses.\n\nI don't think posting here will accomplish much but I figured I may as well vent, and if anyone else is experiencing this too they will find this in a search and know it's not just them.\n\nDetails:\n\nI made my way through the first 3 orders and got the 30% off coupon. Used the coupon on order number 4. Then I placed my 5th order... and that's when something went wrong.\n\nFeb 3 I got an email \"You’re 1 order away from 40% off.\"\n\nFeb 7 I placed that 5th order and assumed this would have unlocked my 40% off, but it didn't happen.\n\nFeb 8 I got yet again an email \"40% off is just 1 order away!\" but at the time I didn't notice it was out of line with the promotion.\n\nFeb 10 I opened up the app to find all trace of the promotion gone. I opened up a chat with support and all they would tell me is I am not eligible for this promotion, despite me sending them all the screenshots of the emails about it. I asked to be escalated and the chat agent told me a supervisor would call me back. Nobody did.\n\nToday Feb 11 I phoned in and spent a full hour on the phone. I kept getting different shifty answers. At one point the agent tried to claim the promotion is still on my account but I just can't see it, and that when the email says \"Order by 2/13/24\" he claimed that means I have to place one more order **on Feb 13**. Yes the agent actually started disputing the meaning of \"by\" in the English language. I went and sent the fine print, was placed on hold for another long period, and eventually was just told that there will be no credit for this. The final response I got in writing was simply *\"This email is to confirm that we have escalated this case and determined that promotion you have is not valid/eligible anymore.

Promo code will be given to qualifying customers within 24 hours of qualifying. Qualifying customers will have until 2/27/24 to redeem the promo.

So actually the math works now: Even if he were scheduled to come in immediately again for episode 10, still episodes 10-14 (5 episodes) would have taken about 10 days to record if each episode took 2 days. \n\n\\---\n\nI read this article about Carson's S15 disappearance due to COVID:\n\n[https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/04/14/drag-race-carson-kressley-judge-season-15/](https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/04/14/drag-race-carson-kressley-judge-season-15/)\n\nI'm just trying to do the math here. He was last seen in episode 4. So when this happened:\n\n&gt;“In this world that we live in, we get tested for COVID every day on set, and one day I showed up and they’re “knock knock knock” on my trailer, like, “Can we talk to you?” And I was like “Oh my God, I’m getting fired”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“They’re like “You have COVID”, and I was like “What?!”\n\nLet's assume that was during the last filming day of episode 5, when he would have been going on the judges' panel but had to be replaced. But then he also says:\n\n&gt;“They said, “You cannot come back to work for 10 days” – it’s like a California Department of Health rule”, recalled Kressley.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“The last episode was going to be in 11 days and I was like, “Well at least I’ll get to make one final appearance and see how everybody did”. And they’re like “No, we need to move the schedule up, we’re finishing in 10 days”.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kressley added: “So I missed the entire season. I didn’t even have a closed circuit camera in the building to spy on \\[them\\].”\n\nSo what this tells me about the filming schedule is, all the remaining pre-reunion episodes (episodes 6-14, which is 9 episodes) were filmed in a 10-day block? So almost all of them were done in only one day. That seems particularly rushed. I thought normally one \"week\" of Drag Race is filmed in two days?",

I supplied the same evidence I do every year: Details and screenshots showing that I contributed the max to my RRSP, info on what my latest RRSP contribution limit is, and a request to reduce deductions at source by that much in the coming year.\n\nThis year the CRA was very slow in responding. They finally mailed the letter out February 15 2023 and I was denied. Here is what they wrote:\n\n&gt;*We have reviewed your request that we allow your employer or payer to reduce your income tax deductions at source for the year indicated above. The amount you requested will likely qualify as a deduction when you file your tax return. Unfortunately, our review of your tax situation prevents us from approving a reduction to your income tax deductions at source.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Based on the information we have available, and the information you included with your request, you have insufficient RRSP deduction room.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*In reviewing your account, we noticed you have $\\[redacted\\] in unused RRSP contributions. These are amounts you contributed to your RRSP but did not deduct on line 20800 (RRSP deduction) of your tax return or, if applicable, designate as a repayment to a Home Buyer's Plan or Lifelong Learning Plan. When you have unused RRSP contributions, it is important to limit new contributions to your RRSP for the current year to avoid making an excess contribution.* \n\nOK so what is that $\\[redacted\\] amount? Well in 2021 I contributed the max to my RRSP and did so before the year was over. In 2022 I started contributing again and in Jan &amp; Feb I contributed $\\[redacted\\] with the intent to use it on my 2022 taxes (because it was beyond my 2021 limit and unavailable to deduct in 2021). Of course those amounts still get reported to CRA so they see it as $\\[redacted\\] not deducted.\n\nI don't see what I did wrong here. My 2022 income is much higher than my 2021 income but I still conservatively made a request that my 2023 income have a reduction in taxes at source based on what was my 2022 limit (that was based on a % of my 2021 income). I included evidence that in 2022 I contributed enough to max out the 2022 limit including the $\\[redacted\\] above.\n\nDid I need to spell out in the letter that the Jan/Feb amounts were intended to deduct in 2022, in order for them to do the math correctly? I've never had to do that before.\n\nAnyway they are now telling me they will not accept a new request until after I have filed my 2022 return. Which I can't do until I get all my tax forms in late March. And if I send in another T1213 in April/May after my taxes are done, who the heck knows how long it'll take them to process it, I might not be seeing a response until the summer at this point.

For example hold down the assistant button and \"skip ahead 5 minutes\", \"skip back 2 minutes\", \"skip to 45 minutes and 30 seconds\".\n\nThis helps to counterbalance the fact that different apps have a wide variety of ways to skip around with the remote. Unfortunately not all apps support it (e.g. Crave in Canada doesn't). But it was nice using it on Twitch when I was playing an 11-hour past music stream in the background and wanted to skip a few minutes at a time without using the app's awkward rewind/FF controls.",

Often it will suggest you shows you can get on Crave but suggest you pay to get it from Google instead. I don't want my aunt to accidentally pay extra for content she already has access to. \n\n- The remote control interface is inconsistent between apps. \"How do I pause it?\" has a different answer in every app because there's no dedicated pause button.

She'll probably be using some shared accounts so this would just confuse her. \n\n- Apps only mode is too limited and not much easier to use.\n\n- Although in theory one can customize the device, remap buttons and home screens etc... I don't want this to be part of the \"setup for my aunt\" procedure because when it breaks she'll be lost. \n\nSo anyway - I'm considering Apple TV, but if we don't want to spend that much, it probably comes down to either a Fire or Roku device.",

But the one that jumps out at me the most is Charlotte and Elizabeth being each other's mothers, each other's daughters and their own grandmothers.\n\nIf I try to imagine the genetics of this, I arrive at the conclusion that their mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) is truly the piece of information with no discernible origin. In a self-consistent loop, we'd expect Elisabeth's DNA to be 2/3rds Peter and 1/3rd Noah, except neither of them possesses any mtDNA to pass into the loop. Their X chromosomes could plausibly come from a combination of Noah and Peter but not mtDNA.\n\nHowever we also hear from Adam that it is possible on each iteration of the time loop for small changes to happen and evolve. He implied that the design of the advanced technology took place iteratively.\n\nSo perhaps in an earlier/original timeline, all time travel was accidental. Something inexplicable happened at the nuclear plant and created a time travel cave. Charlotte didn't exist. Nobody had a time machine yet, which means Noah did not have such freedom to pop back and forth between time periods (or maybe Noah didn't exist yet if he's part of another parentage loop). Tannhaus had no book, or his book didn't have all the answers yet. Peter Doppler married someone else who was the origin of the mysterious mtDNA (let's call her Mother 1) and had a daughter. Let's call her (and any versions of her with the same DNA) Elizabeth 1. \n\nThen in some timeline, Noah gained the ability to travel at will and fathered a Charlotte 1 with Elizabeth 1. Charlotte 1 is not quite the same as the one we've seen on TV, but her presence in Winden changed the course of Peter's life and he married her instead. Their daughter was Elizabeth 2, whose daughter was Charlotte 2. With each successive loop the genetic influence of Mother 1 waned, with the exception of her mtDNA.\n\nThis also kind of leads to an interesting conclusion. Everyone whose parentage contains a loop had at least one \"original parent\" who was washed out of the loop. With each iteration of the time loop, every such person became slightly genetically different as the influence of the \"original parents\" waned.\n\nAnd perhaps it also means, that in the earliest iterations, time travel was not self-consistent. The first time a Mikkel entered the cave and emerged 33 years earlier, he would have come from a timeline that had no Michael, and anyone who came to check on him would also come back to a timeline that still had no Michael. But what we are watching has been iterating for so long that it has converged to be self-consistent.\n\n !&lt;",

    "body": "I've been active in all 3 of NA, EU, Asia Hearthstone servers completing daily quests. I am based in the Eastern Daylight Time zone, but I did not notice until I took a vacation to the Pacific Time Zone that there is an unusual time zone dependency on what time of the day you get the \"X\" to refresh quests.\n\n**TL;DR:** The time of day when a new quest arrives is always the same per server, i.e. everyone around the world gets a new quest at the same time. But the time of day when you get to refresh a quest (at least in EU/Asia) is always **midnight local time** in the time zone set on the device you used to log in. This is an odd inconsistency and leads to sometimes not getting an \"X\" every day if you access from a time zone significantly west of where the server lives.\n\n-----\nFull explanation:\n\nFirst off, I'm only going to speak about EU &amp; Asia here, because either NA works via different rules, or I'm just not usually awake at the important times when things kick in.\n\n**From the perspective of Eastern Time** (which is currently GMT -0400) during summer months I observe the following:\n\n*Asia*\nAt 12 PM (GMT 16:00) a new quest appears every day.\n\n*EU*\nAt 6 PM (GMT 20:00) a new quest appears every day. \n\n*Both*\nAt 12 AM (GMT 04:00) a new \"X\" usually appears on my quest log allowing me to refresh a quest.\n\nIf I refresh the quest after the new \"X\" appears at 12AM *but before the new quest appears*, I am guaranteed to get another \"X\" at the same time the next day. But if I wait until the new quest and then click the \"X\", then a new \"X\" **will not appear** at 12AM and it waits another full day. So if my habit is to wait for the new quest and then refresh one, I only seem to get a new \"X\" every other day. If my habit is to use the \"X\" before the new quest arrives, I get an \"X\" daily.\n\nSo that's been my understanding of how this works for quite some time. Therefore when I took a trip three time zones west (GMT -0700) I fully expected to get everything at the same GMT (3 hours earlier on the local clock than when I see them in my usual time zone). \n\n**Actual result:**\nYes I do get the new Asia quest at 9AM and new EU quest at 3PM.\n\nBut I fully expected the new \"X\" to appear at 9 PM... and it doesn't. It still doesn't show up until 12 AM. So then I tried something. At 9:30 PM local time I changed my tablet's time zone setting back to Eastern so it would be 12:30 AM the next day. Boom. My \"X\" appears.\n\nSo the next day, at 9AM local when my Asia account got a new quest and I didn't have an \"X\", I tried pushing my time zone all the way to GMT+0800 so the date would be tomorrow, and indeed I got a new \"X\" to use.\n\nAnyway kind of bizarre that it relies on client-side settings. I guess I'm only really noticing it because my time zone is so far west of where these servers usually operate.",

In either direction?\n\nIn the past the transfer rules were always just enforced by humans... it's not entirely clear to me how the machines are deciding it.
