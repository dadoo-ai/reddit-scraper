Default value of checkbox field to be true. Keep the field hidden from business users if you think it clutters the UI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a record triggered flow which runs on creation/updation of a Payment Result record with status as Accepted. In this record triggered flow, fetch all the Payment Result records related to the master object and update the value of this checkbox field to false.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then in your rollup summary the criteria will be COUNT of all Payment Result records where Status = Declined and Used for Counter? = TRUE.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

    "body": "Recently made the switch from Android and I love iOS’s native support for creating shortcuts. I usually find myself needing to switch between mono and stereo audio on my headphones and so I created a simple shortcut to toggle mono audio and added the shortcut to my Home Screen. It works as intended, but I’m trying to improve it.\n\nRight now, when the shortcut runs, a banner notification shows up with a tick mark indicating that the toggle is done. However, I would like it to actually display what is the current state of mono audio, whether it has been switched on or switched off.\n\nI know you can create two separate shortcuts, one to toggle on and another to toggle off, but that seems inelegant and a waste of space on the Home Screen. Is there a way to script the shortcut to get the current value of the Mono Audio toggle and display it in the pop up banner?",

The format I am using is website.com, androidapp://package.name.\n\nI thought maybe it was an issue with the changes made on the Web Vault not syncing with the Vault on my phone even with a manual sync, so I waited a few hours and tried it again, and it still doesn't detech. It says There are no items in your vault for package.name.\n\nAnother bug is that in case I hit back on Android after opening the vault, the Auto-fill with Bitwarden dialog box remains open and sits on top of the app, and it only goes away until I go to the home screen and then switch back to the app.\n\nIs there any fix for this?

Loving Gwent so far, and the mechanics, the variety and F2P friendliness are all super appealing. One thing that annoys me to no end however is the lack of any online resource/wiki that can answer seemingly simple questions about mechanics.\n\nIn one of my games, I seized a Kerack Frigate using Sweers, but I was unable to use the Order ability.

I proceeded to Lacerate, he used Order on Frigate again, and then next turn I seized Kerack Frigate with Sweers, hoping to use the Order and then use the Sweers + Volunteer Crew combination to keep spawning tokens.

Plugged the HDD back in, booted again, and it loaded from SSD again - perfect!

Plugged HDD back in, booted up again and it booted from SSD again. Then, I formatted the HDD (which at this point was showing up as D:) using the diskpart utility. Clean, format, assign, all ran fine. Then I closed the cmd window, ensured that the HDD was still showing in Explorer as an empty drive, and restarted.\n\nAnd from that point on, I have not been able to boot into Windows at all. The expectation was that with the HDD being formatted, the system would boot up from the SSD, which it was doing just fine when the HDD was unplugged. However, it went straight to a blue screen error with error code: 0xc000000e. I cannot access recovery environment, I cannot access safe boot, only option is to go into the BIOS. Over there, the options are the usual - Windows Boot Manager (clicking it shows the only option as the SSD), USB Flash/Disk Drive, etc. etc. the usual stuff.\n\nAs an additional test, I removed the SSD and put it back in my laptop (which is now running on that new SSD I bought) and tried to at least boot into Windows and see if I could access the data on the OEM SSD's drive.

Context: I got an M.2 512 GB drive and formatted and cloned my HDD (which had my entire Windows installation) onto it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I know the cloning process worked properly because when you go to Advanced Startup (the thing where you Shift + click restart and it gives you options to boot from other devices) and you select this drive, Windows boots from the SSD and it runs fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, when I go into UEFI BIOS through this method and go to Boot Options, the only options are Windows Boot Manager (clicking this gives an option to select the installed HDD), USB Flash Drive/USB Memory Drive and something else irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do I need to do to make my laptop boot from SSD consistently and ignore the hard disk? Would prefer not to have to remove HDD and boot, since removing the backplate of this laptop is a bit of a tricky business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
