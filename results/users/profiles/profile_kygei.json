About an hour into a 3 hour drive home yesterday, the Jeep just shut down at a red light and would not start back up. When attempting to start up, all I got was that typical \"dead battery clicking\" sound. The battery Voltage gauge was only reading 11V. The weird part is that the Jeep wouldn't even take a jump start, it only minimally \"clicked\" a little harder when attempting to start (also, the voltage actually moved down to 10 or 10.5V when hooked up to cables).\n\nI was able to replace the main/larger battery and the Jeep started, but only for a few second before dying off again. It was able to start the jeep 2-3 times before I checked the gauge and it read between 6-8V (auto parts battery gauge read 14V) and at that point all my electronics were just flickering and flashing (it wouldn't let me move from \"Run\" because the \"Jeep is not in park\". I pulled the terminal from the battery but the jeep continued to click below the fuse box (second battery) until it all stopped entirely and the Jeeps electronics were completely dead.\n\nI haven't changed the second battery yet, and I plan to... but I wanted to see who here might have more experience or insight into what I might have to deal with if the second battery replacement doesn't do the trick. Batteries and alternators both shouldn't have this issue after only 2 years, but here we are.\n\nThanks for your help.",
