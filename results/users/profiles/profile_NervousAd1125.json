Odoo, on the other hand, shines with built-in ERP, CRM, inventory, and pricing flexibility, especially for managing both retail and wholesale operations under one system. It does require more setup and technical know-how. If you're torn, there’s also a middle path—tools like the Odoo-Shopify Connector let you sync products, orders, and customers between platforms. That way, you can use Shopify as your storefront and Odoo as your backend system. It adds some complexity but gives you the best of both.
