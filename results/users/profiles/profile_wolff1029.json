I've also implemented the delete call within the destroy() method.   \n\nMy rational is as follows -   \n1.  When the testExTree.cpp file is executed, the constructor for the myExpressionTree instance for t2 is called which sets root to NULL.     \n2. Later when the build() method is called on t2, the simple tree is constructed and I explicitly set root to point to the \"the root\" newNode variable.   \n3. When the end of the main method is reached, the destructor for t2 (~myExpressionTree()) would be called which then calls destroyTree() and then destroy(root).   \n4. Since we explicitly initialized newNode, rightNode, and leftNode in build() with the new keyword, I was expecting to have to delete these nodes to deallocate the memory from the heap.   \n5. When delete on the newNode is called, I was expecting the ~ExpressionNode destructor to run which would delete the left and right nodes.   \n\nThat said I am getting a Segmentation Fault when deleting root, so clearly I'm misunderstanding how the logic is executing.

I thought it would be interesting to look into the United Center and see if it the Bulls ownership was guilty of any of the criticisms that John Oliver makes in general of sports team owners.  After a short search, I realized the answer was yes.  \n\nThe good news is that the construction of the United Center was 100% funded privately.  The ownership of the stadium is a clean 50% Bulls - 50% Blackhawks split. However, since the 1990's the Bulls/Blackhawks ownership have received significant property tax breaks.  These are detailed in this report (http://www.scribd.com/doc/119324703/1-4-13-NothingButNetReportFull).  The property tax paid for the United Center from 2002-2007 was $8.5 million.  These tax breaks saved the United Center ownership between $30 -$70 million for this six year time period.  This information is only available for this time period as it had to be disclosed as part of an appeal to lower their property tax burden.   These tax breaks are set to expire in 2016, so I imagine we will hear more about them in the coming months.  A Chicago Tribune piece from this past January (http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-rahm-new-united-center-office-complex-met-20150122-story.html) states the extension of them was off the table.  Despite this, I imagine they will be used as some form of bargaining chip in the construction of the office building/training center for the Blackhawks that has been proposed (discussed in the Tribune article above) .  \n\nJerry Reinsdorf is guilty of more than simply questionable tax breaks that are associated with the United Center though.  In the 1980's, he used the threat of moving his other franchise, the Chicago White Sox, down to Florida to convince Chicago foot the bill completely for what is now US Cellular field.  That stadium is now valued at close to $125 million according to the Nothing But Net article above.  I don't want to ramble too much about Reinsdorf's affairs with the White Sox, so I will end it here.   \n\ntl;dr  Not publicly funded construction , but large property tax breaks since the early 90's expiring in 2016\n",
