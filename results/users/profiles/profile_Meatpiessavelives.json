    "body": "Similar thing happened to me when I took acid the first time. I had a profound realization that the person I was with (4 years at that point and at the end of my 20’s) wasn’t someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I cared about her and loved her, but I think I knew deep down there was something missing - an inconvenient truth. The acid made me face that. I came back from the weekend away and battled internally thinking maybe I was just tripping. Part of me knew it was true but part of me felt maybe I was expecting too much from someone. I ended up breaking up with her which was hard…I felt terrible. We’re still on good terms, but in short - not long after I met the love of my life. We’ve been married for 3 years now and expecting our first child. I really feel like it was the universe giving me the push in the right direction that I needed.",
