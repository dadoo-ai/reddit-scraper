I work for a company that specializes in admin-for-hire and consultation for companies using Salesforce, and we have a good few clients that do not want to give us our own dedicated license to do work in their org once every 2-3 months so we share login credentials with one of their internal users with a sys admin Profile (yes, I know this isn't best practice and technically goes against TOS, but I know we're also definitely not the only company like us that does this). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, what I need to know is if anyone is aware of a good workaround to allow us to continue sharing a license with another internal user for login and meet the new MFA requirements? I've seen the MFA FAQ document that Salesforce released back in March and it clearly says that Salesforce prohibits the sharing of licenses, but we would need to make some major changes to accomodate this. We've had a handful of companies in the past that set up MFA for a shared licensed user and it was a heck of a hassle getting ahold of the internal user every time we needed to log in and I suspect there is a better way to handle this that I haven't considered. Any help here is greatly appreciated.",
