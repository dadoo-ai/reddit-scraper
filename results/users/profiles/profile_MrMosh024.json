I think if you care about fake internet points, then understanding your audience and shaping your discussion to your audience will lead to a more positive interaction with the community.\n\nI'll use your recent discussion regarding Petrucci as my example. \n\nFirst, the subject matter is divisive, you're talking about a flaw in a man that many people view as an icon. People don't like to see their hero's attacked or shit talked on - that's just human nature.  So, suggesting he has 'flaws' is the first oversight. \n\nSecond,  you're talking about a subject matter (live improvisation) that requires a.) people to have seen the band live b.) recognized that he was improvising and c.) have the understanding or background to discuss it intelligently. People that don't understand things, will react negatively. All they see are the words \"Petrucci\", \"Flaw\" and a big lengthy post and it's an instant downvote.  \n\nThird, Dream Theater is not an improv band. You don't get that tight without practicing over and over and over. Their playing and sets are so meticulously planned and rehearsed that their isn't much ACTUAL improv.   Yes, they are each virtuosos at their respective instruments, but they've never been an 'improv' band. \n\nFinally, you're always going to encounter people that don't have the same opinion. As much as you may disagree with it, that's what the 'downvote' button is for. Some will engage in meaningful discussion and some just downvote and move on (and sometimes people do both) and that's OK.  I think it's unfair to label a community or its members as 'TOXIC' because people don't share the same opinion.  Unless you're looking for confirmation bias and/or want to live in an echo chamber.\n\nThis my $.02. Feel free to downvote me.\n\nCheers!",
