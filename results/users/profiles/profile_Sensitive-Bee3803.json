    "body": "I have been (and continue to be) directly impacted by this program. It's very depressing and stressful. \n\nI did contract work for a FAANG. I was supporting a team that played a technical role at the company. Maybe 80-90% of the FTEs on the team I supported were H-1B workers. Many of them were great at their jobs, but I'm sure most could have been replaced by someone who didn't require sponsorship. The H-1B workers, however, work like they are indentured servants. I'm not sure how the visa holding FTEs' pay compares to US worker FTEs' pay, but I'm confident the foreign workers were working more hours. \n\nAlong side this, I think all of us US-based contract employees did not require sponsorship. We worked \\*very\\* closely with the FTEs so in many instances the work overlapped with what the FTEs were doing, but we didn't get the high pay and benefits. Some of the contract workers I worked with had been doing contract work there for over 8 years. Then about a year and half ago the company decided to get rid of all of the contract workers and replace us with a WITCH company. WITCH companies are a handful of companies (Wipro, Infosys, Tata, Cognizant, HCL) that are primary based out of India and are known for long hours and low pay. And surprise, surprise most of the people in this WITCH company were not US workers. \n\nSo in the end most of the FTEs and contract workers were foreign workers. \n\nIt's been more than a year since my contract ended and myself and some of the other contractors still struggle to find work. You can't tell me that the H-1B program doesn't negatively impact US workers. I have over a decade in my field. Pretty much the only roles I'm contacted about are contract roles that have crappy benefits or no benefits at all. The pay for the work I do is going down more and more while the expectations for the roles are going up. \n\nLook at Meta. It has a history of preferring foreign workers over US workers. Below are a couple of articles related to this. \n\nI also linked to a video where Bernie Sanders talks about the negative impact of this program. \n\n  \n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-doj-immigration-lawsuit/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-doj-immigration-lawsuit/)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/legal/meta-must-face-lawsuit-claiming-it-prefers-cheaper-foreign-workers-2025-02-25/](https://www.reuters.com/legal/meta-must-face-lawsuit-claiming-it-prefers-cheaper-foreign-workers-2025-02-25/)\n\nBernie Sanders talks about H-1B workers  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxn-tyuKBus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxn-tyuKBus)",

Some of the contract workers I worked with had been doing contract work there for over 8 years. Then about a year and half ago the company decided to get rid of all of the contract workers and replace us with a WITCH company. WITCH companies are a handful of companies (Wipro, Infosys, Tata, Cognizant, HCL) that are primary based out of India and are known for long hours and low pay. And surprise, surprise most of the people in this WITCH company were not US workers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the end most of the FTEs and contract workers were foreign workers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been more than a year since my contract ended and myself and some of the other contractors still struggle to find work. You can&amp;#39;t tell me that the H-1B program doesn&amp;#39;t negatively impact US workers. I have over a decade in my field. Pretty much the only roles I&amp;#39;m contacted about are contract roles that have crappy benefits or no benefits at all. The pay for the work I do is going down more and more while the expectations for the roles are going up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at Meta. It has a history of preferring foreign workers over US workers. Below are a couple of articles related to this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also linked to a video where Bernie Sanders talks about the negative impact of this program. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-doj-immigration-lawsuit/\"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-doj-immigration-lawsuit/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/meta-must-face-lawsuit-claiming-it-prefers-cheaper-foreign-workers-2025-02-25/\"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/legal/meta-must-face-lawsuit-claiming-it-prefers-cheaper-foreign-workers-2025-02-25/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bernie Sanders talks about H-1B workers&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxn-tyuKBus\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxn-tyuKBus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I stopped filling out the application. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there was another job that not only wanted supervisor contact info (email AND phone) for employers, it also required me to provide references at the time of submission. Yeah I stopped filling that out too. The amount of time and effort it takes to dig up this information when I probably won&amp;#39;t even get any emails from a human just isn&amp;#39;t worth it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s 3 out of 5 roles. I suppose someone will be more desperate than I am and actually provide this info. What are your thoughts on providing all of this with your application?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have never lived in an area where it snows. I grew up in the South and have been in the Bay Area for 20+ years. I do prefer cold over the heat, but I am not sure about the harsh winters. Aside from the weather, Minneapolis/St. Paul sounds great&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;hybrid on site 1-2 days/week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;pay would be lower than market, but if I were to compare this with job 1 for FTE the pay for this role would likely be better when considering location. Benefits look good&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;appears to align perfectly with what I would like to do, the type of people I want to work with, and the pace and style of the way I work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;company is an operations company that is a leader in the space they&amp;#39;re in&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;based on glassdoor reviews they are quite good for both the company and CEO&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The people I would work with have been there for 6-7 years&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear others&amp;#39; thoughts. I&amp;#39;m not sure how to evaluate this since all of the good things are mostly on par with each other but the drawbacks are different and significant. I created a matrix chart, but I still have a very unclear answer. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

There are so many people looking right now I don't think I could get $72/hr for most of the contract roles I'm looking at.

I'm not sure how to figure out what would be appropriate. \n\n  \nHow do you determine your rate?
