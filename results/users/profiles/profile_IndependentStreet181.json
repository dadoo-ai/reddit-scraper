Agentforce sounds like a game-changer in AI-driven customer engagement! I'm curious about the pricing model— how does Salesforce balance affordability for businesses of varying sizes while ensuring the platform's advanced capabilities? Is it designed to scale better for smaller businesses, or is it more focused on enterprise-level adoption? Would love to hear how you see this playing out in terms of accessibility and ROI for different types of customers!",
