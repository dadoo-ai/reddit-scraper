This is long overdue and we need more of it!!! It‚Äôs occurred to me when listening to republicans whine and pout and call us hypocrites for the mid-decade gerrymandering act in California that there is a very firm and clear distinction between what Texas did (soon to be followed by other red states) and what California is doing. We‚Äôre not just fighting fire with fire. We‚Äôre fighting an out of control raging wildfire with a thoughtfully planned controlled burn. The response to republican corruption that we‚Äôve seen from California couldn‚Äôt be further from the hypothetical cheating republicans and MAGA media personalities want to paint it to be. The difference is that California and other blue states that hopefully will follow are putting the final decision in the hands of the voters. That is the very essence of democracy. The shady redistricting in Texas carried out solely within the confines of the congressional session should terrify EVERYONE, not just democrats and progressives. Having the politicians choose their constituents, making them far less accountable to them in the long run because they‚Äôre only beholden to the financial backers and corrupt leaders that helped them get to where they are goes against everything this country is supposed to stand for. We are patriots, not hypocrites. Just because MAGA has co-opted the term, real patriots fight for democracy and rage against tyranny, *especially* in the highest levels of government, and anywhere else it shows its face. We won‚Äôt be portrayed in history as the turncoats MAGA republicans try to make us out to be, and we can‚Äôt let them shame us for finally fighting back.",Conversation,post,profile_-AdequatelyMediocre-.json
