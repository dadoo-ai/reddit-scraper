    "postMessage": "Scenario: Projects have up to 15 roles. The roles are defined on a related list. ( Project Team Member ) The people in the roles want to be able to see their projects in reports. Managers want to see a report of all the projects and the people working on them. I have been able to manage individual reports for people using cross filters. However the report never displays the peoples names in the rows/columns. How can I build a manager report to show all the projects with the project team member names? A Project with Project Team Member report is repeating rows like crazy. A joined report is border line unreadable. Cross filters gets me a report for a Manager with 5 people but I can't show in the report who is on what projects. All I can show is that the project has 1 of the 5 people.",
