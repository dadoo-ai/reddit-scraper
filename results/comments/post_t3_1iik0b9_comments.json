    "postMessage": "I'm experimenting with using AI agents to query data and surface items for data quality resolution based on user requests. The thinking is that this would help save time associated with data quality requests or issues. I've been building using Azure functions and OpenAI's Azure Tool calling, but I'm starting to think that the most recent agentforce workflows could handle this in a similar way. Has anyone used agentforce to help with data quality at scale? How was it?",

      "commentBody": "We get a lot of ad hoc user queries or legacy data that has been shoehorned in. We are constantly updating/changing the system which has resulted in data quality updates being needed. We are relatively mature and have several inbound data sources, but still find changing data or operations impact the quality of our Salesforce data. Sounds more like a delivery/freshness/governance/process/tech debt salad of issues. I donâ€™t think the agent is going to save you with something like this. Maybe a new question: Am I the only one spending 50+% of my time analyzing data and how we use, clean, and maintain it? no - 1. most of analysts spend half of time on data curation. 2. the another half is try to explain why the data is right or not right. Thank you! To your second point, if the people who are using the data don't think it's right, then I'm not sure that the data is providing value. What processes and documentation exist to track data provenance and lineage? What is the state of data governance? These are usually at the very root of the problem you are describing. As painful as it is to address, trying to throw a quick short-term solution at this is a lot like providing Tums for Appendicitis. Itâ€™s not going to solve the problem, and your stakeholders are going to be back complaining of pain. Do you see stakeholders reading data lineage and governance documentation?
