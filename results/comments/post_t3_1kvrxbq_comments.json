    "postMessage": "We’re exploring AI solutions for customer service and AgentForce looks promising, but it also seems early and not exactly out-of-the-box. Curious to hear from anyone who’s worked with a Salesforce consulting firm to implement it — did it actually streamline workflows and improve support, or did it feel like just another chatbot with extra steps?",

      "commentBody": "I run a firm. For what it’s worth, it’s great once it’s trained but don’t expect it to just “run” - i think thats where most people fall flat. Also, if you want immediate value, look into incorporating AI to your processes. Like natural language driven case distribution, having AI drive priority and severity of cases.. heck, one of the coolest, yet simple functions is sentiment analysis of your customers.. just take snapshots then now you can get sentiment as a metric that you can tie to individual reps and benchmark across the whole org. Chatbots are cool and effective but require training and setting up a proper RAG. But there’s so much other ways to do more value lol. Hey, appreciate your insight. What is RAG in this context? Retrieval Augmented Generation.  Simply put it is adding data to the prompt for the Llm to give grounded (with facts) responses.   Proper RAG means it is optimized so you are sending the right data at the right time. you mean instructions / scope we put in Topics and Actions for Agentforce ? Appreciate the suggestions around AI applications beyond just chatbots. The idea of natural language-driven case distribution and using sentiment as a metric tied to reps is especially interesting—never thought about benchmarking that way across the org. If you don’t mind me asking, did you build most of that internally or partner with someone to get it stood up? You shouldn’t call it training, because that’s misleading. The whole philosophy in the way Salesforce has deployed generative AI is that the underlying LLM is a commodity. So far they’re kinda right.",

      "commentBody": "Most consulting firms would be desperate to do this for you for free and with a case study out of it THIS is spot on!! I was at TDX and they had two top early adopter AgentForce partners get up there and provide guidance for the consultants and partners... Choose the right use case, start simple and iterate, etc. That was the ground breaking advice... On my phone, I booked my plane trip home before lunch was served... That was only 3 months ago. The energy and excitement was at a level 9/10 but the depth I saw among partners and Salesforce folks was a 2/10 and I was okay with that. It was a mixture of pros learning the tech in search of a problem and folks like me that showed up with real problems and customers trying to de-mystify the collection of tools, services, and what is supported / not supported. Push aside the hype and griping about packaging and price... There is a very solid foundation and platform for building and transformation here. Back to your point on partners wanting experience and case studies... I agree 100%. If there is big $$$ at stake, my take is choose a partner where Salesforce is not their only competency. Find a partner that has been doing Salesforce / data cloud (not to be confused with Salesforce DataCloud) work for years, has a long history and library of real-world use cases for AI projects. I am not an integrator selling these services. I have been on other end jumping in as a data leader vetting some partners selling the dream but poised to deliver a nightmare for everyone! Salesforce didn't invent AI and we (collective technology / software) have had least 18 months to produce real-world LLM powered applications and case studies. To your point, it is a buyer's market. I recommend folks don't let Salesforce squeeze you for AgentForce credits if you don't need them.. If companies want to go for it or kick the tires, it's simple enough to make sure everyone on the implementation team has completed the trailheads (even product leaders). Technical implementors are at minimum certified. Review resumes and hold your integrator accountable. If a project goes sideways, you may have found yourself in the same spot I have been... an early adaptor finding the limits of a maturing product. Your point about finding a partner who actually has real AI and data chops (not just Salesforce certs) is spot on. We’re trying to avoid the “selling the dream, delivering a mess” scenario too. Also love the idea of keeping things grounded—start simple, pick the right use case, iterate. And yeah, holding partners accountable with trailhead completions and solid resumes is such a good call. Easy to skip when the sales pitch is shiny. did you bring in a partner or build it out internally? Would be great to hear how you approached it. In my case we did bring in another partner with great track record. I would have loved to have cut my teeth on the project and taken the glory or helped them fail fast… too much at stake for client. I will learn by proxy and if successful I can endorse the partner... As we all know, AI just like BI/analytics is a fruitless endeavor with some form of data management and governance. Those are things that don’t exist for small and medium enterprises so I am cautiously optimistic. Cheap or free yeah. I know a few friends still working at SIs if anyone needs a contact. I don’t make a dollar from it",

It's just that many are comparing it to just hiring someone full-time overseas vs AI agent, and the cost is not that different.",

I mean many consultants have the certifications but do they really have up-to-date knowledge of Agentforce and first hand experience? I don't think so. Salesforce offers a ton of resources to learn. Especially for partners. But your right. Consultants probably have little project experience. Since Agentforce is so green, I think to be successful you have to keep your project idea simple and do incremental updates. Completely agree—this isn’t the kind of rollout where you can afford to cut corners on talent. We’re making certification a baseline, especially for technical leads and architects.",

      "commentBody": "Full transparency I’m completely biased here as a Salesforce partner, but we’ve seen strong results from the majority of our clients leveraging Agentforce. It’s all about identifying the right use cases that will promote business value and work within the bounds of the technology. Not every pilot works out though, so there are some lessons to be learned from those that didn’t move forward. We have other clients leveraging external AI solutions that we’re integrating into core platform as well - so it all depends on what you need. I’ll say that as the leading Agentforce partner, we get access to extra product team support, partner advisory board perspective, and funding towards pilots that give us an advantage, which may be why our customers see success with an emerging technology. Happy to provide more perspective if you have additional questions. I'd be curious to learn more about your perspective on the bounds of the technology and good use cases. We're about to start on our second attempt to implement Agentforce. The first was during the 1.0 days (middle of last year). While we were able to deliver something, it was very underwhelming. Much of the output was the AI parroting our own data points back at us (something we could have done faster and cheaper with a tearsheet or procedurally generated summary). Even when prompted, the level of insight and analysis was just too low. One of our devs said it was like asking a 3rd grader to work our key metrics into a paragraph or bullet point. My concern is that we're expecting too much of the system. Maybe providing too much or too little data. Maybe under prompting it, or being too strict with the output. So I would love any ideas you have around getting Agentforce to ingest data and actually be insightful rather than robotic. Although we’ve seen results with FAQ based agents, the outcome does vary if you’re only grounded in knowledge (although there are lots of ways to fine tune these types of agents to get beyond 3rd grade level). You absolutely can create a “smarter chat bot” that just talks a little more like a human and doesn’t add value to justify the cost. Our clients seeing success are getting into action based outcomes. Leveraging Agentforce to update internal and external systems autonomously. The use cases are basic in nature given where the technology is, but so many of their tier 1 support cases are just that, very basic. I guess my question is, why even have AI do these small little logic steps, when a simple if/then program could handle it? Totally fair question. If/then logic can handle the simple stuff - but the moment you need that logic to branch based on real-time data, customer history, or multi-system workflows, it starts to fall apart or get super brittle. Agentforce gives us more flexibility as agents can reason across systems and respond dynamically without hardcoding every edge case. We're replacing traditional einstein bots that had 12 potential outcomes with an Agent that's far better at categorizing and taking action on those 12 predefined actions. Ever asked a chat bot a fairly simple question only for it to go down a totally different path unrelated to your question? We're seeing significantly better reasoning with Agentforce than chatbots. Well now I need to know who you are. The leading Salesforce partner?? Do I know you? Haha. Also at an SF Partner. I will say, getting a dedicated Agentforce AE has been super helpful. Also. That weekly partner call is my bread and butter. Probably Rosetree Solutions Appreciate the transparency — and honestly, it's helpful to hear from someone with hands-on experience, even if it's from the partner side. What you said about identifying the right use cases really resonates. That’s kind of what we’re trying to figure out right now — where AgentForce could actually make a tangible impact versus just adding another layer of tech to manage. It’s good to know not every pilot works out; that kind of honesty is rare and valuable. Too many companies rush to find the fastest use case. This could be due to corporate pressure to quickly showcase wins leveraging AI or pressure from Salesforce to get a pilot up as faster/cheaper is always better in their sales culture. Pilots fail when there isn’t buy in from the entire leadership. Don’t build cool things just because they’re cool. We’ve heard of other’s pilots dying because executives say “we could answer ‘where’s my order’ 10 years ago at a fraction of the price. We don’t need an agent to do that”. You have to get your organization to agree on success before trying a pilot. The field of digital labor and agents is only going to improve over the next 12 months. If you have a real use case, you can absolutely see value, but don’t feel pressured to be an early adopter just for the sake of it.",

I’m not saying that there aren’t use cases where this is beneficial, but you need to take a step back and look at how you can re-engineer your business processes to take full advantage of the capabilities of Agentforce. For this, a consulting firm might be useful as long as they can demonstrate to you that it’s something that they do. I beleive engaging with a consulting partner who understands both the technology and business context can be a smart move, provided they bring practical, proven experience to the table. Curious to hear if you’ve seen specific process transformations where Agentforce made a significant difference? Well, I want to be careful that I don’t provide any detail that might identify the client, of course. We built an agent that addressed a problem that spanned multiple people and functions and took a process that consumed hours down to a couple of minutes. That’s the good news. The not so good news is that three different departments were involved and they weren’t motivated to re-engineer their processes to work with the agent because it would’ve reduced headcount and budgets.",

Well, I want to be careful that I don’t provide any detail that might identify the client, of course. We built an agent that addressed a problem that spanned multiple people and functions and took a process that consumed hours down to a couple of minutes. That’s the good news. The not so good news is that three different departments were involved and they weren’t motivated to re-engineer their processes to work with the agent because it would’ve reduced headcount and budgets.",

      "commentBody": "We’ve explored AgentForce recently as part of our AI support stack, and you're right — it shows a lot of promise, but it’s not quite an out-of-the-box solution. It definitely benefits from a thoughtful implementation, especially if you're aiming to streamline workflows rather than just add another chatbot layer. From what I’ve seen, having some hands-on Salesforce experience (or expert guidance) helps in configuring AgentForce to actually enhance support operations — like: Automating routine interactions Improving case triage Syncing properly with CRM data It's not magic on its own, but with the right setup, it can genuinely improve efficiency. Would love to hear how others are approaching it too.",

      "commentBody": "I agree with some of what is said above. I personally think it is more important for the admins and dev teams who run the instance to enable Agentforce on their own in a sandbox and find where there are gaps and decide on the buy it or build it side. The biggest issue admins and developers will have is Data Cloud and data in general. Garbage in is garbage out. Paying a company to just click some toggles buttons and then to assign some permission sets just isn’t worth the higher price tag.",
