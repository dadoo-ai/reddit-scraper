Maybe expand its capabilities to our other apps, maybe even answer basic hr questions. Could be a huge time saver for pretty much everyone.",

So they invest as little as possible.   Outcomes are customers HATE customer service, the service agents cannot win, they're hated by both parties. If agentForce can allow a business to have a robust call center, without the massive overhead of people, space etc, they'll love it. Customers will be happy to speak to an agent, and get a faster outcome. Both parties win. Losers are people that work in call centers. To be fair...they've always been on the losing end If",

We have knowledge articles with pricing, promo and product details but the complexity of these is high. Reps are challenged to search for, and find, the correct knowledge article that answers their questions. (eg. Can this product do xyz? Does this promotion.... Whatever). We're looking at giving them an Agent that had access to the knowledge base and hopefully will be able to answer these questions faster and more accurately than letting the reps comb through all the text in the Articles themselves. Will it work? I don't know. But seems like it's worth trying. Make some account planning topics/actions too Sounds like a bad company who can’t get their shit together. In multiple directions.",

I'll give you a hint, we were looking at using Claude, the cost to just staff up the new team is less than the cost of AgentForce.  It's not a rinky dinky thing, unless you work at a rinky dinky company.   I don't.  We're big, massive.  AI resources (good ones) are prime. Good luck with maintenance, security compliance, QA, etc on that Good luck with that on agentforce lol Its already done and in one spot. Go have fun with Hubspot or Zoho or whatever you actually use. Confirmed that you haven’t used it yet huh? You should probably do some research and you might be a bit more successful in your role. Oh trust me I've used it. Your ignorance is showing",

I’m definitely skeptical when evaluating SFDC products/3rd party solutions (it’s my job) but holy cow would it be a gamble to invest in this from what I’ve seen. Normally I agree with you, but this time it’s a fully functional working product. I’ve used it and it works quite well. Both for internal and customer facing applications. I second this. Ive already built agents (source: I’m a SF SE) Well that actually means a lot. lol SFDC’s track record had me prejudice. Maybe just maybe I wont be a grumpy old man this time ;) We get so used to their marketing vaporware… or close to it anyway that when something real comes we are skeptical.
