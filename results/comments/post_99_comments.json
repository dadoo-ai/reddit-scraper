    "postMessage": "Hey, I'm pretty new to Salesforce, so sorry if there's an obvious solution to this. But I need to create a partial sandbox, in which there are only data from 2025. I have a partial sandbox, where I already hit the limit, but most of the data are from before 2025. Is there a way, to import just data from 2025?",
