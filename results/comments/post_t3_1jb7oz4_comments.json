Here it is, in this video I look at how to : - Enable Einstein and Agentforce. - Assign relevant permissions and licenses. - Create custom topics and actions specifically for Revenue Cloud. - Utilize standard and custom actions, including Query Records, Submit Order (Dynamic Revenue Orchestrator), and a custom Apex action to Suspend Billing. https://preview.redd.it/e8qfb5l1kooe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce83cbd4cb9285e7643673559369010ac45e412 Thanks for watching, let me know if you have any questions.",

      "commentBody": "Thanks for the video, it's great to see concrete use cases of Agenforce. Still not convinced of the added value of Agentforce vs. buttons that trigger specific actions other than the \"natural language\" part. That seems to be what is holding me back the most from being fully onboard My 2 cents for what it's worth I use these as examples and it's a good way to learn. The better use cases will be when you start building complex examples, multi-step processes that have more agency. Take this data point and act on it based on XYZ + Business Rules. But for the simple examples, there might be value when you start calling them on mobile or from slack, so avoiding logging into Salesforce entirely.",
