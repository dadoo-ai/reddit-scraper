    "postMessage": "Salesforce promised our client an Agent capable of dynamically querying records, generating reports, and running flows. However, after weeks of setup, we're still struggling to make the query records feature work consistently. We're using the standard \"General CRM\" topic and actions, which are supposed to leverage Einstein AI to retrieve records dynamically based on natural language and CRM data schema. Unfortunately, the outputs are either inconsistent or irrelevant, even with the same inputs. Several things may are contributing to this issue: Our client's data model is poorly structured, making it difficult for the agent to interpret and retrieve the correct records. The primary language used is not English, which may affect the agent's ability to understand and respond accurately to queries. The same inputs often yield different outputs, indicating underlying issues with the agent's processing logic. Is it realistic to expect this level of functionality from the Salesforce Agent, especially with a complex data model and non-English language? Did Salesforce consider the possibility of clients having messy or non-standard data models when designing this feature? How can the agent operate dynamically and consistently based on user input if even the standard methods are unreliable? Can anyone provide assistance or point us to relevant documentation to help us understand this hot pile of glorified garbage? EDIT: Also, is it possible to have multiple Employee type of agent? Maybe one for each business profile?",

      "commentBody": "AI in general doesn't work well with poor data. Your other points are valid, but asking \"Did Salesforce consider the possibility of clients having messy or non-standard data models when designing this feature?\" isn't really a Salesforce issue. Salesforce (and most software vendors in general) aren't going to design for a poor foundation. AI in general doesn't work well with poor data. I don't disagree but that is if you are trying to build on rails experiences; i.e. querying for specific records will only ever be as good as the query can get data. AI is actually very good at making sense of unstructured data if you feed it the data and let it train on it.  This is simply not the Agentforce model though. Atleast make the agent read the damn field description so that you can help him understand the org context. As for now if you dont have a 100% perfect data model with perfect naming you will always get incosistent results. Unless you create x custom actions for y scenarios and instructing him when to use them like a smarter chatbot. create x actions for y scenarios This is the entire purpose of agentforce. It isn’t an LLM. It has LLM capabilities to determine what you’re asking for, then the custom actions do what you want them to do. The whole point of it is to be a “smarter chatbot”. Your expectations of the product seem wildly misaligned These are not my expectations, they are our client expectations based on what Salesforce sold them.",

      "commentBody": "First of all, a bad data model is always going to give you all kinds of problems now and in the future - that's why companies that hace clean data models are seing more success. The same applies to things like Knowledge, customers who piled on a ton of crap without ever reviewing their articles are having a hard time with RAG and blaming it on the product. There's a few things you could try to get it to work better, and that is mainly writing better and more constrained instructions into the Agent Topic. If you notice that unrelated objects are queried, try writing instructions specifically asking the Agent to only query objects defined in the instructions (use API names). If your use case isn't extremely broad (e.g. you want your users only to query 3-4 obj and not 50+), it may make sense to create a custom action for that by leveraging Flow/Apex + a well defined Prompt Template to translate request to query. To your last Q: Currently, Employee Agents are restricted to just that single Default one. You create different topics for each broader set of use cases and you should make sure you're writing proper Titles & Descriptions for each topic because those are evaluated by the \"reasoning engine\" when selecting the appropriate topic. If they aren't distinctive enough, you'll end up with wrong topics being selected by the agent. I think you can further restrict topics by filters, but I am not 100% sure on that Knowledge, customers who piled on a ton of crap without ever reviewing their articles are having a hard time with RAG and blaming it on the product. First question I am asking when an AI idea comes up: how reliable is your documentation and process?  If its not good then most of the low hanging AI fruit is not going to be easily attainable. 100% Guys this thing is getting sold as something that can understand the context of ANY org and make magical thing. If I have to write an instruction for every single boarderline scenario for every entity in my org then what is the point? Im just vibe codig a chatbot. It'll only get better in the future but I get your frustration. I see this as a big opportunity to support customers to get there though And im absolutely fine with agentforce getting better in the future but do not market it as an already all capable tool…",

We do have data cloud but what should I for? And how can I leverage it to fix a bad data model? Its like a rewiring of the existing data in a new, better structured data model? The semantic layer is what gives context to the data.  Its the \"instructions\" for how to query Data Cloud.  Lets just say for example that you want to ask agentforce \"what is the current employee churn rate in the southern region?\"  How on earth would it know how to calculate \"employee churn rate\"?  You have to define that as a CI or a calculated field in the SDM.   You can also have multiple SDMs created that all might be related to specific context.  There could be an SDM that is configured to answer HR questions, another to answer sales questions.  Maybe a massive one that you hope can answer every question?  But at the end of the day, pretend the agent is an intern....you cant ask an intern a question without giving them any context and expecting them to return accurate results.",

      "commentBody": "I partly disagree with some of the above. When we did our Agentforce implementation, we had a lot of learning for the employees to get to the data. Mastering a prompt isn't just for the Prompt Engineer, it is also for the user. \"show me all the accounts with a red flag\" This is about the worst thing you could ask any LLM. The LLM doesn't understand colors, the LLM doesn't know what a flag field is. \"Get all Accounts with a Churn Risk of High\" This is so much clearer. The Agent Actions that Salesforce built out-of-the-box know you need an Account, the field name is Churn Risk and as it is a picklist, look for values set to High. If you need some help, hit me up on Serviceblazers or Agentblazers. [removed] You are technically correct, however the field was a Formula field that looked like this... IMAGE(\nCASE(Risk_Type__c ,\n\"No Risk\", \"/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=<ID>\",\n\"Challenged\", \"/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=<ID>\",\n\"Pre-Churn\", \"/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=<ID>\",\n\"Identified Churn\", \"/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=<ID>\",\n\"Unknown\", \"/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=<ID>\",\n\"/s.gif\"),\n\"Customer Health Flag\") And this was a random thing our older Salesforce admin found that made a pretty flag with a pretty color show up. I want to rip this out and make this a conditional formatted field on the lightning page. Needless to say, Einstein has no idea how to deal with the above code. The internal wiki said they used this page as inspiration... https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/320559/im-trying-to-implement-a-case-flagging-formula-but-sometimes-the-flags-work-som You should be able to solve a lot of that common language vs specific language via the prompt builder.  Yes, it will do better if you give it on rails instructions but then you are missing so much of the benefit of AI/LLMs. In your example you should be able to define that when a user says \"red flag\" they mean \"Churn Risk of High\". You seem to have a solid knowledge of what is going on under the hood with agentforce. Looks like the prompt builder uses other models to process the request. Im curious to know what exactly is doing the work in the agentforce chat, another user told me that its not an LLM, what is it then?",

I would recommend using flows to get data as opposed to the agent. The primary language used is not English, which may affect the agent's ability to understand and respond accurately to queries. Salesforce is using OpenAI APIs, but non-English languages are still WIP. Some of the European languages are in beta https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000372976&type=3 The same inputs often yield different outputs, indicating underlying issues with the agent's processing logic. This depends on the instructions you provided. I have not seen this issue and I think you should look at the instructions again. This needs to be specific, just like code. The only difference is that you are writing in plain english as opposed to code Im using the standard CRM General topic and action with standard instructions, description etc. without touching anything you get incosistent outputs",

Mind you, this was in an org SF provisioned. So, this wasn't about incorrect/sub-optimal data model etc. Worryingly, I could also break the instructions to get answers about other clients that the one I 'authorized' as. This was a use case involving data cloud and a chatbot. So, I decided to wait until things settled down. \nI wasn't surprised by the indeterminate results as I hands-down expect this with anything to do with LLMs. I just cannot fathom pushing the agentic-actions on a set of instructions. Product owners and BAs will likely be held liable for a lot of things. Time for us all to learn the law and protect ourselves if we are likely to be held liable since Salesforce (sure as s#$t) won't be.",

Currently working with custom AI, Microsoft AI, and some various AI providers.  All of them have this problem; you cannot reliably yield the same outputs without a lot of time and effort to refien the prompting/personas and then it all needs to be re-evaluated the moment a new model gets rolled out. One thing we found very helpful though was always giving examples in our prompts so it can compare its output to the example.  In an example; we have a custom AI integrated with Salesforce evaluating customer emails.  We give it example emails in the prompt to compare to when it does its thing and it was night and day difference in the output.",

      "commentBody": "I totally understand you, and this is happening to me as well. Salesforce sold Agentforce to our Client like it can magically produce relevant insights from the data that is in Salesforce with low code like actions, flows and prompt builder. The thing is Agentforce is good at a very granular level like producing a summary or asking questions on top of a single record and probably it's related list. It won't work if you want it to do that at a more aggregated level like Region, Country or Org.",
