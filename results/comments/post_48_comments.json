      "commentBody": "No this is basically the best solution that is out there. There are some other vendors but they arenâ€™t as scalable and they integrate horribly with salesforce. You need to authenticate the partner and provide them secure access to customer and pricing data, so partner communities is the best overall platform. You can get login based pricing which works in your favor though.",
