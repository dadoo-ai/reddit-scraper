    "postMessage": "Our team is looking to have the ability to target Accounts that haven't had a specific Opportunity type in a certain amount of time (eg. No Customer Opportunity in the last year, No Vendor Opportunity in the last 6 months, etc.). I'm trying to think of the best approach to this because I'd really like to avoid creating roll up fields because I can see the use case growing and would like it to be dynamic. Anyone have a good scalable approach to a request like this that worked for you?",

You can OOB filter on these as you wish in reports and list views.\n\nOr perhaps a compromise - two fields: last_opportunity_close_date__c and last_opportunity_type__c. Obviously you'd only be able to report on whichever the most recent opp type is.",
