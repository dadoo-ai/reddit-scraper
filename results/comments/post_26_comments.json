    "postTitle": "How to Practice for a Salesforce Developer Interview",
    "postMessage": "Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people prepping for Salesforce developer interviews by just reading question lists or memorizing Apex answers. I used to do the same thing. But honestly, that kind of prep doesnâ€™t help much when youâ€™re in a real interview and someone gives you broken code or asks you to explain your thinking. So I put together a post about how to practice in a way that actually makes you better. Itâ€™s for anyone trying to become a Salesforce devâ€”whether youâ€™re coming from an admin role, starting out, or trying to move into a more senior position. The post covers: What kinds of things interviewers look for (debugging, tradeoffs, Flow vs code) Why itâ€™s important to talk through your logic Some common mistakes people make when prepping A few ways to use Forcecode to practice hands-on If youâ€™re prepping for interviews right now, I hope this helps you feel more confident and focused. ðŸ‘‰ Hereâ€™s the full post Would love to hear how others are practicing too.",
