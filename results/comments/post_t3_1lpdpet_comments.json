    "postTitle": "Using Agentforce for client facing chatbot",
    "postMessage": "So my firm has a customer facing chatbot (Einstein). Our metrics are good (deflection higher than  45%, customer satisfaction> 50% and other metrics are quite good as well) My firm wants to explore Agentforce for the next stage of chatbot (next 6 months). Idea is to take our Deflection rate >60% , reduce maintenance effort and add more topic handling in chatbot Me and my team have done some testing and fooled around with AF and in our honest assessment although we can get the same #s with Agentforce, the risks and costs far outweigh the benefits. For our internal chatbot (to be created net new) providing product info and troubleshooting support using Agentforce is a no brainier for us. But for external chatbot - we don’t feel confident taking the leap. Has anyone undertaken any similar assessment - what were your findings? What were the challenges you observed? Do you feel confident in making AF customer facing? If anyone has gone live - how did you mitigate the risks for am external facing chatbot, what controls did you have in place? Thanks a bunch!",

      "commentBody": "You’ll want to start by putting strong guardrails in place. Use intent classification only where needed, batch test aggressively, and set up monitoring on agent logs to catch anything weird early. I’d also recommend digging into your current escalations - which topics are still routed to agents? That gives you a focused roadmap for what to automate first with Agentforce. Prioritize the low-risk, high-volume use cases first. It can deliver strong results, but only if you approach it like a proper product - not a quick plugin. As with most projects, the discovery and solution design phases are where success or failure is decided. Skipping that groundwork is what usually makes Agentforce underdeliver. As per my understanding intent classification will be required all the time- we have more than 100 intents on our traditional chatbot. So in order to get user to correct answer - we will need it switched on everywhere AFAIK. For the guardrails - as per my understanding we are solely dependent on “prompt setup” and while in our limited testing  it is giving us no major red flags re blatantly wrong and off topic answers - we believe having more than 100 topics is gonna mess it up and we will see a lot more Inaccuracies. And on having those low risk - high volume topics - those topics are already doing reasonably well in Einstein. To get more deflection we believe we should build more integrations for self - serve with data in CRM. AF is going to give us more or less the same product albeit with less control and less monitoring power over what our bot is uttering. You can’t have 100 topics in a single agent regardless, so I’d really challenge the architecture that you’d need 100+ topics for an agent. AF is going to give us more or less the same product This statement just highlights that you aren’t really understanding how much more advanced of a tool that Agentforce (and Agentic AI in general - forget about Salesforce native products) is over an Einstein Bot I think the limit is about 15 topics last I checked Correct, I’d really challenge OP’s use case and frankly, agentforce knowledge if they’re attempting to put 100 topics in there, just fundamentally a really messy approach and not possible with the product Clear. As I mentioned, we had limited scope for our first round of testing. We did have less than 15 topics. \nSo the limit of 15 topics/intents is actually news to me. I will have to take this info back to see what it means for us. I am assuming we would need multiple agents to handle all our topics and we will have to figure out a way to bundle similar intents within an agent to cover the full ambit. Making assumptions here clearly, but it really feels like you are making this way too complex. I know Salesforce has a tendency to market and present their products better than they actually are, but their agent on help.salesforce.com has 7 topics, and that handles practically every sort of question someone would be searching Salesforce documentation / support for I’d challenge your build if you are starting with 15+ topics, especially as you’re mentioning a limited scope. I’d be really curious what these topics are, as I feel like you’re not leveraging the power of the product / not understanding how the atlas reasoning engine works if you’re truly expecting to need 100 topics for a finished solution Similar intents should be a single topic, that you can then granularity control outputs via instructions and actions within that topic, along with sample utterances to help with classification. You shouldn’t approach an agent like a 1 to 1 mapping of an Einstein bot, that’s the purpose of leveraging AI as opposed to a very structured, if-then chatbot where you needed to configure a TON of options for whatever a user mentions The more complexity you add, the worse your results will be, especially for a customer facing agent Makes Sense. Our classification of a topic might also be different than yours. For us “how to reset a password” is a separate topic than “how to resend a setup email”.  For you both of them might be under a topic like “account support” Reasons they are also setup as separate topics are because depending upon the purchase/details of the user - the answer and handling is quite different. Totally understand that we need to leverage the existing OOTB functionalities as much as we can and avoid cramming way too much in terms of content and  adding complexities. I think we did definitely go down the rabbit hole of “what ifs” and customising for it. Thanks so much for your response though. It was helpful. However you want to approach it, but FWIW - this isn’t “my” approach, this is how Salesforce (the company that developed the product) approaches it (I.e account management, case management, etc). Good luck! What are your bot use cases? You wouldn’t have 100 separate dialogs, you would structure your topics as jobs to be done. So each topic would accomplish multiple things. You might have a topic for order management that can respond with order information, handle cancellations, or order modifications and answer order related questions. Another topic for answering general/product related questions, etc using knowledge. Another topic for account management and password resets, etc… And so on.",

          "commentBody": "Makes Sense. Our classification of a topic might also be different than yours. For us “how to reset a password” is a separate topic than “how to resend a setup email”.  For you both of them might be under a topic like “account support” Reasons they are also setup as separate topics are because depending upon the purchase/details of the user - the answer and handling is quite different. Totally understand that we need to leverage the existing OOTB functionalities as much as we can and avoid cramming way too much in terms of content and  adding complexities. I think we did definitely go down the rabbit hole of “what ifs” and customising for it. Thanks so much for your response though. It was helpful. However you want to approach it, but FWIW - this isn’t “my” approach, this is how Salesforce (the company that developed the product) approaches it (I.e account management, case management, etc). Good luck!",

We did tons of testing, added explicit guardrails, added more guardrails. We also had external firms do penetration testing. All of that, and we didn’t really expose any issues. I’m talking months and months of testing. For reference, the agent was using public APIs - meaning the blast radius would’ve been at least somewhat limited. Do your due diligence, like someone else said - it’s not a plugin. You don’t need to do months and months of testing, the scrutiny is a little higher when shipping a product out of the core monolith.",

Only advice is have heavy lifting done in the prompt builder and use the instructions to further refine the information returned. You only get 50 instructions per topic. \nSo I use a prompt-triggered flow to grab and filter what information I want sent to the prompt builder. I think use instructions in the prompt builder to refine and transform that data. The I create an auto launch flow as the basis for the agent action in the flow. I would also add a success/fail variable yhay the agent can use.",

      "commentBody": "u/Suspicious-Nerve-487 has given you great insights so I +1 those. The whole point of an agent is that you do not have to identify all the intents and paths like you do with bots. You need to understand what the Atlas Reasoning Engine is doing - that is part of the power of Agentforce. Read this: https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-is-a-reasoning-engine/atlas/ Yes you need to give it instructions and guardrails but you don't need to outline every path for it. You may only need a few \"Topics\" - General CRM, FAQ if you are leveraging a Salesforce knowledge base and/or RAG through Data Cloud. Your success will depend on how the KB is structured (certain structures and breakdowns work better for Agents) and how rigorously you test it in order to refine it. It is going to understand the difference between resetting a password and sending a reset email - especially if both are outlined in your knowledge base. From there, you'll need to monitor and refine it with refined instructions as you see how it responds. Use the inquiries from the bot to run it through and see how the responses compare. The benefit here is you already know what people are asking. Maybe you need some custom Actions to do more deterministic things but you can have multiple Actions on a Topic. Check out the Agentforce Guide https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/guide/ and the Agentforce Champion and Innovator trails on Trailhead. It might not hurt to get a Salesforce Partner with Agentforce experience to help you - even if just to consult with you in the beginning.",

After some trial and error, we found Chat Data to be a game-changer. It let us boost deflection rates while actually reducing maintenance headaches. The customization options and high-accuracy training tools were key for us. We could fine-tune responses and add new topics way easier than before. Plus, the analytics helped us stay on top of performance. Maybe worth checking out if you're looking for alternatives? Hope you find a solution that works for your team! we found chat data to be a game changer You quite literally are the founder of this.
