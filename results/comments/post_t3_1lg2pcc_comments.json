I use focus on force and I notice that there are no multiple choice questions as I had when prepared to the admin exam. So will the real exam look like this?\nAlso, could you please share your experience with this exam? How hard was it?",

They are free, include hands-on practice, and the Superbadge from the relevant trail really helps with both passing the exam and gaining practical skills. For practice tests, I suggest checking out the ones on Udemy. They are very helpful!",

      "commentBody": "I took the certification exam last month, and all the questions had multiple choice answers - 3 choices and only 1 was correct. I did use the FoF study guide and practice tests. I also completed every trailhead module/trailmix that I could find including both Agentblazer levels that are currently available. Have you signed up for any Agentforce Now workshops?  Those helped solidify my knowledge.  And, I did both Guided/Scheduled and Self-Study workshops available thru the Salesforce Developers site. A lot of the questions on the test are scenario-based.  It helped having all that hands-on practice to decipher what the question is really asking for.  Don't rush through.  Carefully read those scenario questions. Good luck! Thank you!",

I mean all questions in this practice exam on FoF have just three options to choose and only one is correct. When I was training to the different exam, the questions could have 3-5 options with 1-3 correct answers. That’s the difference \nBut if the real exam has multiple choice questions, I’ll be mentally prepared for it:)",
