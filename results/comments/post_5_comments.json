Accounts without files attached I've tried custom reports with Accounts and content documents (since I can't find \"files\" anywhere) and the standard reports do not allow me to display Account information. Is there any solution for this? Thanks beforehand!",

Associated to target Account id set ( use IN operator to allow checking wide array of target record ids). Can use ContentDocument id to grab ContenVersion info if need to further filter or pull in relevant info (file name, type, size, etc)",
