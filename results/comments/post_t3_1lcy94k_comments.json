Especially in Canada where the job market is the worst I've seen. Is the entry free? I can attend if it is. World Tours are free. Dreamforce, DX, and Connections are not. The \"Dreamin's\" are not free either, but those are community-led and only have contributions for Salesforce, not run by them. Yeah it's free Cool, I will sign up. I am curious ...has anybody found any kind of job by going to those places ? That's what I am going to explore. Never been to any other events. Are you trying to get your first job in Salesforce in Canada ? Nah. Already have one. But seeing the layoffs there is no sense of job security here. I can't say I have directly gotten a job from being at a specific World Tour, but it is more part of a networking slow burn and I have done in-person interviews @ Dreamforce.",
