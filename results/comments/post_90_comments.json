    "postMessage": "This recent (hilarious) post https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/s/J687hX4Gfk made me wonder‚Ä¶ What do you do to prevent scope creep during a project? Obviously the best answer is to not take on clients like that üòÖ but for those of you who aren‚Äôt solo/don‚Äôt get to choose your clients‚Ä¶ what are your strategies for minimizing scope creep and/or keeping your sanity? When I was a consultant I used the ‚Äúspreadsheet of truth‚Äù that tracked requirements but that was like ten years ago and also it didn‚Äôt always work. What are yall doing instead?",

      "commentBody": "You did say what happens after it is signed if you have no control so I will tackle that first.\n\nIf you are the lead consultant on a project, or have a weak project manager, then you need to compartmentalize everything. Phasing is key.\n\nIn the initial phase of the engagement work as hard as you can to have mutual agreement on what is IN SCOPE. In even more depth than the statement of work that was signed.\n\nWhen they try to go outside of it, refer back to the agreement.\n\nIf the client is still pushing past those boundaries then there is not much else you can do but charge them more and delay the project.\n\nBUT the reality is that this is all controlled by a clear SOW - without that it's never going to be easy.\n\nIf you are able to affect the signing, then do this: every engagement I sign has a page dedicated to this - see the exact verbiage below.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ih40qx3ndjf1.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f2ef1073fb83b8f2613a2cd4cfa189f4187cddb\n\nThe funny part? In 5 years I have never had to rely on this to push a client into being fair.\n\nI only work with people I know are going to be good partners.\n\nIt's not easy, it means you need to say no sometimes - but the reality is it's better for their success.\n\nGreat topic :)",
