    "postMessage": "What is the smartest solution for creating a scheduled flow on a set of calculated insights ? Note this is for a custom quote object, so i would like to schedule a flow to send reminders based on due date of said quotes. The calculated insight calculates days until due date on the quote DMO. The issue is that there are only Data cloud record triggered flows . Does a refresh of the CIO which in turn updates the days until due calculation count as an update to trigger the flow? What is the best way to go about this?",

This option would mean that we would have to create an activation towards SF , create the corresponding records there right?\n\nHowever maybe this is the best option if there are no other ways?",
