      "commentBody": "Assuming your are talking about a per quote line setting:\n\nIn drawers, yes. If you use the isFieldVisibleForObject method in the QCP you can control whether drawer fields are displayed or not given line level criteria. It’s not a field set but it works in a similar way.\n\nIn the main tabular view, you can’t change the displayed fields for each line. If you use the QCP you can make a field appear to be blank or locked but the “cell” itself does not go away. In fact I’m not sure how that would work even conceptually considering the column headers are on the top spanning all rows.",
