    "postMessage": "Has anyone been able to successfully opt out of the “Ask Agentforce” functionality on Trailhead? I really want to opt out of the functionality (I have a huge problem with the rapid rise of AI and LLMs and how they use data), but I’m not even sure if Salesforce will honor that request. Any advice (besides ignoring the button)?",

Edit: If you mean remove the button/widget for Agentforce from the website for you, no.. I doubt SF will do that. Yeah, I want to opt out of all AForce functionalities on Trailhead, and I’m sure others might want to as well. I don’t trust AForce and I don’t really trust any AI/LLM feature (until GDPR-related laws are passed around data used in the features) Sorry the double reply, but you may not want be using Reddit either: https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/n Well shit! The more you know! Thanks, fellow Redditor! Good luck... it's a crazy time in the world. I guess I don't quite follow what, besides, the \"ask agentforce\" button -- which is really opt in for you to choose to engage with it. I suppose you have to engage w/some level of AI for Trailhead - that's basically how they check if you did X or Y right in hands on building. Can't see that going to a human to sign off on...  If you want to opt out of that, then you just can't use the site. I'm not much of a fan of AI either, but... like you said, there aren't GDPR related laws yet, so whatever SF Is doing is compliant w/current laws/regulations... why would they, a company who makes money off AI, want to proactively show others how to limit it's use? Yeah, I don’t do much of the projects/superbadges (never really have done much of ‘em, especially since the way my company uses Salesforce is a bit…odd…to say the least). I sometimes wish that Salesforce at least thought its AForce processes through instead of releasing a half-baked product at DF, but an architect can dream Will you stop using your smartphone? I have the Siri features and other data tracking features turned off for the most part. I would, but alas, I have to use it for work as well if you go to your photo gallery and start searching for a key word and see what comes up..",
