    "postMessage": "We have several fully licensed users who only login to salesforce to access files that are attached to records like agreement PDFs on opportunities, etc. Our org's leadership is asking me to explore options to have these files exported and be accessible via sharepoint so we can reduce our license usage. Power Automate in MS365 seems like it's up to the task, but it would require a complicated PA flow that we lack the in-house expertise to do (mainly because of the number of dynamic elements involved to create a navigable folder structure because you can't just dump all attachments into a flat folder and expect anyone to find what they're looking for).  In theory the flow would have to create nested subfolders with top level folders for each Account record, then subfolders for opportunities and any other desired salesforce data objects, and then subfolders of those for each individual opportunity, etc. A recent project that involved a comparably less complicated PA flow required an outside consultant to implement. The one-time cost of a consultant would be outweighed by the license savings in a year, most likely. I'm pushing for having these users just reach out to my team, tell us what they're looking for, and then we send them a copy of the relevant file attachment(s), but leadership is hoping for a more scalable solution. Has anyone done anything similar in terms of exporting file attachments to external storage in a useful way?  Appreciate any advice anyone has to offer.  We're just trying to examine possible options at the moment. Thanks!",

It is a nested folder structure.\n\nSo people who are not in salesforce would see all the same things the Salesforce team sees.\n\nKnow what I mean?",
