    "postMessage": "Salesforce had that Superbowl ad with Matthew McConaughey running around the airport and they list Heathrow as a big customer on their website, but I can't find anyone reviewing or talking about the new AI features that are supposedly available at Heathrow thanks to Salesforce. Heathrow still gets some of the worst reviews of any airport in the world. Has anyone here recently flown out of there or know anything about how good the touted AI features are IRL?",

One of their org is a shitshow in terms of development, best practices, pipelines. I am seeing it very close but I am not part of it so can't go put my nose in and teach people about version controls, best practices, naming conventions. I just help around the peers who are working there when they are stuck or have questions. Treat the ad as just an ad, maybe even a misleading one, but yeah, things haven't been implemented yet. If anything, it might start about 6-8 months down the line. tldr: No Agentforce yet. Agentforce work starts towards the end of the year. Heathrow is a customer of Salesforce.",

They do say AI pulls a ton of power from the grid. You... Know that everything happens in the data center, unrelated to the location of use, right? You know that some businesses use more compute from some datacenters than other companies, right? You know some companies have more hardware dedicated to their compute, right? It's not unheard of for a particular customer to draw more energy and processing time from a datacenter to the point that it becomes a hog on the system.",
