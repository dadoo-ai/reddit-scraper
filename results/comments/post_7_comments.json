Spread across all the different teams who might use it. We do a fair amount of project/lifecycle management in SF, so it’s not *just* a CRM for us. We even manage some implementations there! \n\nEveryone works at least a part of their job in Salesforce where we track so much about our customer and their various products and statuses. It has taken a lot of work but across our approx. 1000 customers I can tell you from Salesforce at a glance where they are in their lifecycle, what they have, what we’re actively working on, and what’s next! \n\nBy setting Salesforce as our system of record for Customer, it means we committed to a lot of data quality work - AND integration with various systems/tools so that they all feed updates back into Salesforce.",
