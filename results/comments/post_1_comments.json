So to save you some time, if you’re in the same boat, here’s what I found super helpful: Trailheads (obviously): Here Free YouTube Course: Here Paid Udemy Course: Salesforce Certified Administrator Training (Jan 2025) by Francis Pindar Practice Exams: Focus on Force (prepares you well, aim to score 80% min. on these) Here Salesforce Official Practice Questions: Here I have also created a discord server for networking/help/studying, if anyone wants to join, you are more than welcome: https://discord.gg/trjdwSCG5R",

If you read through 100% of that text twice you will very likely pass, though once is enough for many.",

On top of that, some of the modules are basically garbage but the resources linked at the bottom is where the good stuff is stored - and also where most of these paid courses are based on.  Essentially thats what the paid courses are, a collection of re written documentation, often with a voice over or some palatable way of teaching.",
