      "commentBody": "Nice work getting your Agentforce chatbot up and running! Once the basics are in place, the real value comes from continuous improvement and aligning it with how your users actually work. A few suggestions: Analyze Usage & Feedback Review transcripts and usage analytics to see where users drop off, rephrase questions, or get stuck. That will highlight gaps in intent coverage. Expand Knowledge Coverage Add FAQs, process guides, and quick links to the most common internal requests (password reset, policy lookups, troubleshooting steps, etc.). Integrate with your Salesforce data where possible so the bot can surface real-time answers instead of just static responses. Add Escalation Paths Ensure a smooth handoff to a live agent or support channel if the chatbot canâ€™t resolve an issue. A seamless transition builds user trust. Personalize the Experience Use user context (role, department, or profile) to tailor answers. For example, HR-related queries for HR staff vs. Sales queries for Sales teams. Automate Routine Actions Go beyond Q&A by connecting to flows: updating a record, creating a ticket, or checking status. This moves the chatbot from an info source to a productivity tool. Regular Iteration Treat it as a product: gather monthly feedback, review logs, and continuously add new intents or flows.",
