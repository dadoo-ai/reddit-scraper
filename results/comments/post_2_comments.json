    "postMessage": "You know how Salesforce has a slight habit of renaming products every other year (or quarter üòÖ)? I put together Renameforce, a site that: Lets you search old names to see what they‚Äôre called today Check out the rapidly changing Leaderboard A few fun things (quiz, name generator) üëâ Check it out: renameforce.com I‚Äôd love your help: Did I miss any infamous renames? I tried to find a good list, and put together what I could...I'm sure I'm missing stuff Features you‚Äôd want to see? Was this the worst spend of my Saturday time? This is meant to be both helpful (because consultants/admins need this) and a little hilarious (because‚Ä¶ c‚Äômon, it‚Äôs Salesforce). I'd love your input!",

From my understanding the goal of 2gp, is to pull from source control so we can get a folder structure that will be ignored when uploading to Salesforce. 1gp is using a developer org as source control. Now in both cases Managed packages can only be deployed from a dev org which has unique name space / prefix add to each component. Also the VS code has a feature called package which tells VS code what meta data to pull &amp; by default only pulls code without objects from salesforce. Now we may wonder why anyone would do this &amp; the answer is large apps like Veeva &amp;  I think Industry cloud, are Un-managed, so they don't have a name space / prefix &amp; therefor can use source control &amp; tools like auto rabbit &amp; other tools to deploy VS code Packages (NOT sf packages or change sets) to hundreds of orgs. However, the majority of apps &amp; and customer admins don't need something this complex, but try explaining this SF &amp; its biggest vendors.",
