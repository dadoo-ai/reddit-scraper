    "postMessage": "Hi, I am working as a Salesforce Developer/BA for an Indian MNC. Currently, I have 7 years of experience in IT, out of which 3.5 years are in Salesforce development. I want to ask you how I can upskill myself to be equipped to work as or transition into an architect role in the incoming 2–3 years. I want to plan, learn, and get relevant opportunities. That being said, here is my experience so far: Initially, I worked in Sales Cloud for a couple of years, mostly developing LWC components and Apex triggers. I then got the opportunity to switch to more challenging projects, which involved Service Cloud, but my role was as a BA/Developer. However, I did get a chance to work on service features like assignment rules, Omni-Channel, and integrations with other systems. One thing I consider a mistake during my initial years, and even now, is that instead of upskilling, I would always dwell on issues my teammates were facing, even outside office hours. It did help me to debug better, but I didn’t upskill much through Trailhead. Thanks in advance for all the answers! :D",

      "commentBody": "You’re already on a solid path. To move toward an architect role in the next 2–3 years, focus on architect-track certifications like Integration, Data, Identity, and Sharing &amp; Visibility, since they build toward the System/Application Architect credentials. At the same time, broaden your exposure by working on integrations and cross-cloud implementations such as Experience Cloud, Marketing Cloud, or MuleSoft. Most importantly, start shifting your mindset from pure coding to designing scalable, secure, and business-oriented solutions. This combination of certifications, cross-cloud experience, and solution design will position you well for the architect journey.",
