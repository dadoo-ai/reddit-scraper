    "postMessage": "Hi everyone, how are you? I've been a Salesforce Marketing Cloud Consultant for 6 years, but I've never touched the Personalization module because it's not widely used in my country (Brazil). An opportunity to work with this came up, and they're offering a lot of money. I have 1 month to prepare as much as possible about Personalization for the client. What do you recommend? I have basic knowledge of Javascript and Node.js, and I need to understand Personalization as much as possible to be interviewed. What do you recommend?",

You'll have hands-on exercises there for your demo MC org. \n\nSalesforce Personalization, aka Einstein Personalization is the new product - it's now part of Data Cloud feature set.",
