    "postMessage": "Hey everyone, I’m doing some research for a blog post about the new Agentforce pricing model and would love to hear from folks who have actually used it. To me, it seems really convoluted and if I were given the option to use it, I might opt out. Anyway, I’d love to include some real input from the community. I feel like the Salesforce world could use some honest feedback on this topic. Salesforce is offering both: Pay-Per-Conversation ($2 flat rate), and Flex Credits , where each “action” like summarizing, updating records, or suggesting next steps costs credits From the outside, it feels confusing, especially when trying to estimate usage or justify cost to a manager. If you’ve used Agentforce: What kind of use cases are you running it for? Are you using the Flex model or per-conversation pricing? Have you run into unexpected credit burn? What would you tell someone budgeting for this tool? I'd love to use some direct quotes for use case scenario examples. Happy to share the blog when it’s live too, if that’s helpful. Thanks in advance!",

      "commentBody": "We ran a POC that was cost prohibitive. Easiest way to describe it is putting together a supporting report as part of our execution efforts There were alot of pros though:\n- Building didn't need anyone with any AI experience\n- Seamlessly fits into the UI\n- Time to market was 3 weeks\n- Decent results Cons were heavy though\n- Data Science team was able to build a tool a week behind the SF team that cost $.03/run with higher quality output\n- Hallucinations were higher with SF\n- Outputs weren't as tunable with SF The Data Science team would still have needed to do some integration work to put it all within a single screen - but they were already building an approach that supported multiple use cases. Now that SFDC is being flexible with pricing we are giving it another look as we work to build agents and agentic automation further across the business - so far, no joy. You need to factor in The cost of the data science team and everything that supports them... Not saying it's a SF win but.... We did as part of the POC. Break-even was 3 months then cost-wise the win goes to the DS team. We are re-evaluating in the new cost structure and within two other tools because we want more people to be able to create these abilities. We only have so many Data Scientists. Data science team isn’t going away by purchasing Agentforce, and they are creating solutions that work with multiple applications and integrations, not just one.  Economies of scale. It's not that complicated as long as you don't need the \"Einstein Trust Layer\". It definitely does not require a data scientist At my company the data science team occasionally works on salesforce stuff, but mainly does other stuff. No one’s bringing on DS just for salesforce. Yes and... They still have a cost Have you talked with Salesforce about implementing the model that your data science team is using? I know that SF has bring your own model capabilities, but they don't seem to have adjusted pricing based on that, which doesn't make sense to me. Not really. This is far from the first time we've incorporated our own into Salesforce. If we leverage SFDCs agentic world, it'll increase costs again so we're continuing to roll our own. From a non tech-savy person I am curious, I always tought that using AI Agents made from a specific vendor within a SaaS that they are selling (in this specific case Agentforce on Salesforce) was always cheaper compared to a \"build your own agent\" approach. Without going into too much details, but how did your DS team been able to create a RAG Agent that is able to perform actions (let's say, update a record) in a Salesforce environment and that it's even cheaper than AF current pricing? We have a few advantages\n- Data Science team with a lot of cross company agents and agentic capabilities\n- Supporting infrastructure for managing and allowing them to interact\n- Extensive data lakehouse with lots of metadata (key) Our solution is still a POC. Its a button for a purpose locatwd where it's needed. When you press the button the POC\n- launches a new browser menu\n- Pulls in those resources from the SFDC record (associated to it)\n- Creates the artifact then iterates with the user to get it right (leverages other agents to apply style guides and check for accuracy, prevent hallucinations etc)\n- Writes back to Salesforce Cost is easy to explain. Every three months the cost to run foundational models is cut in half as the context windows and capabilities expand. OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, Meta etc are all in a race to commoditization. Writing to Salesforce is also incredibly easy. They've been on a huge integration push for a decade so interacting with the platform has alot of mechanisms. What we don't have is as nice of an interface that'll support any purpose. For our purposes, we can leverage our specializations and existing architecture to knock it out. Agentforce assumes you don't have any other abilities for LLMs and gives you basic capabilities native to the platform. It's also ridiculously expensive compared to all our other options for direct or platform based LLMs. As the cost comes down, we'll likely explore it again. Einstein took alot off our plate in the first few years and uplifted alot of teams. Eventually agentforce will get there. Currently its more than an order of magnitude more expensive. thanks for the answer! so you are not using any vector DB in order to exploit RAG? We use vector stores, knowledge graphs, llm indexing and more. The individual solutions are use case specific.",

      "commentBody": "Salesforce doesn’t lower pricing for funsies. There must be low adoption for them to have changed to the flex credit model. I heard they got feedback from partners and customers that the pricing was too expensive without anybody figuring how to estimate usage…even SFDC wouldn’t know how to estimate potential “conversations”…this new flex pricing will hopefully lift one more barrier to adoption Apparently in the summer release you can have that granularity of reporting. To me this will be the point where we can use it seriously. It's not lower pricing at all. It's a more predictable model based on usage. Previously, if you had a conversation (e.g., a user engages with a support agent at least once within a 24 hour period), it didn't matter how much the Agent did - if it was a single question and response, or twenty - you were charged the same price on that conversation. Now, every action the AI takes incurs a cost. Longer conversations with the AI doing more = higher cost, shorter conversations = lower cost. It helps SF be more predictable with their margins, and is closer to, though not fully in line with, how the rest of the industry bills. We are making progress after having no traction with it but it seems with the latest update you need Data Cloud enabled no matter what so maybe that is where they are making the money back? Data Cloud is enabled on the backend to store the audit logs and support some of the reasoning engine’s functionality - that’s it. Oh that makes much more sense. For some reason I thought AF was able to run locally (as in on the org with only that org’s data) without DC. Thanks for the correction. It definitely can! You don’t need to use external data with Data Cloud for Agentforce. But Data Cloud gets automatically provisioned when turning Agentforce on for the reasons above.",

          "commentBody": "It's not lower pricing at all. It's a more predictable model based on usage. Previously, if you had a conversation (e.g., a user engages with a support agent at least once within a 24 hour period), it didn't matter how much the Agent did - if it was a single question and response, or twenty - you were charged the same price on that conversation. Now, every action the AI takes incurs a cost. Longer conversations with the AI doing more = higher cost, shorter conversations = lower cost. It helps SF be more predictable with their margins, and is closer to, though not fully in line with, how the rest of the industry bills.",

Would be intrigued to see other people’s use cases and best wins so far. Quick question: how large of a Salesforce customer are you? We've been asking for this, but seem to be too small to be interesting.... Unless they're still doing it, a lot of the 1yr free implementations were arranged in December and had to be completed by Jan 31 and live in production. My company got this offer too. Marc wanted to be able to say \"We had 1000 customers live in January 2025!\" for all the marketing this year so they basically bought the implementations to get there - 1yr free (it's actually a limit on credits to cover what they think 1yr would be for that customer) + free third party consultant implementation. It's interesting to capture some stats with without spending our own dime. Ours is mostly just a knowledge bot right now - the time to do anything more complex just didn't work in the tight implementation timeline we were given, and we were finding that other tasks took a lot more effort to build and would have varying results as SF was pushing updates to Agentforce and the LLM. We may try some more things later this year before the credits expire to determine if we continue with it next year or not. We are about 500 users + marketing cloud. We are a company that Salesforce Ventures invests in though which gives us an advantage. How the hell did you get a free year of Agentforce lol",
