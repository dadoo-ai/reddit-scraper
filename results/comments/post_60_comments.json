    "postMessage": "This is weird. I work in Pardot for my company, and when composing a new email I went to upload a gif that used the .gif file extension. I have done this numerous times before, no issue. But the upload fails every time. I've tried as many things as I can think of: reducing the file size, changing the file names, creating a new file from scratch from the same video, using different browsers, I've even tried uploading a gif file that had already been successfully uploaded before and that fails now too. The specific error message is: \"[File name]\" Upload Failed - undefined. Images and PDFs still load fine, it's just .gif files. Any ideas what the issue could be? I already have the IT administrators of our company looking into the account settings, but want to know if there's anything else including something stupid I may have been doing wrong or something simple that I've overlooked.",

      "commentBody": "Hi! Pardot user since 2011 here.\n\nIt's an odd error that makes me think something is wrong either \n\nOne: with the file itself (wrong file type, like a jpg saved as a gif). Try re-saving it from scratch.\n\nTwo: maybe you are trying to update a file that already exists with the wrong file type. Like you already have a file in place and you are trying to overwrite it? If it's an existing file like a PNG you are trying to overwrite as a GIF? (That doesn't work, unfortunately. You'll need to match the first file type in order to overwrite it.)\n\nThree: issue with browser cookies. This can happen when doing a bunch of random stuff and it just happens randomly. You'll need to try logging out entirely, clearing your browser cache, and logging in again. Also try a different web browser. And, to see if it's limited to you, ask a colleague to try, and see if they get the same error. \n\nFour: eh Pardot is having a bad day. Open a ticket and see if they can help you.\n\nHonestly based on what you said I doubt it's a file type thing. It sounds like you did the most common troubleshooting.\n\nI think it's either a browser cookie/cache thing or Pardot is having an outage.",

I've made sure the file name wasn't the same as an older one, I've cleared my cache and tried again and tried on multiple browsers and had a coworker try it, and I've waited a day to see if it was a temporary Pardot problem.\n\nI've submitted a support ticket as well, just waiting to hear back and hoping someone else would know something I could try in the meantime.",
