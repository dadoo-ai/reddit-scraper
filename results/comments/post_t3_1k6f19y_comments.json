      "commentBody": "$2 per conversation has got to change if they want large scale adoption. I've had a lot of conversations with various agentforce engineers and management lately, as we've been setting up a few different use cases for Agentforce. The pricing model is changing very shortly, to be token based. Within a month. This is directly confirmed by several Salesforce employees. They moved away from tokens as a pay structure initially because nobody on their sales or AE teams knew or could explain how any of it worked. I hope they get better documentation this time around. They still can't Yep, eta is 5/13/25 for this Safe Harbor! uau, vamos conversar?

Parent commenter can delete this message to hide from others. Info Custom Your Reminders Feedback Could you explain what token-based pricing means in this context? To me it sounds like they are still paying for every convo, i.e what’s the difference between $2 per convo versus say 0.5 token per convo? Thx The short version is: If you have a very brief, simple conversation, it will be considerably cheaper than it is now. If you have a really long, complex conversation, it will be considerably more expensive than it is now (though, without being an expert on this, depending on how it is scaled versus standard rates of e.g. ChatGPT usage, you'd have to have a really long, really complex conversation for it to reach $2) how will the token based model work? I haven't gotten specifics but I guess similar to how ChatGPT handles it. A request and a response gets a token value, based on length and complexity and based on that, you pay. Nobody paying list price dude What's the point of list prices then? Deter customers who sees the list prices and go 'Fuck no' I think that depends on the definition of conversation. If it is an end-to-end customer service standpoint, it's not too bad. Think about how many calls a customer service rep based in the United States can handle in an hour? 10 Max? Even then that's only 20 bucks an hour and I'm probably overestimating at that 10 number. I don't actually know the answer to this, but that is something to think about when you hear $2 per conversation. The problem is that the same conversation using Gemini would probably cost less than a penny. I went through and asked gemini 5 in depth qualitative questions about 30k accounts to try to automate account research for my reps. It cost me less than $15. $2 per conversation is hundreds of times higher than the competition for something that still requires copious amounts of setup and development. Call/voice based AI assistants are not even available yet nor any pricing for them.  Voice agents will be much more expensive. EDIT: And the main risk most of us have is that the AI voice assistant just replaces current state call deflection at a much higher price point than current call deflection technology.  You still end up with as many calls going to humans as you did before.  In my experience calls that end up with humans are almost always going to end up with humans because those callers do not want any other result than a human (we are also seeing more and more sales where the only way we win the deal is if the customer is guaranteed a human support experience so eliminates even thinking about AI for them). I disagree bc that logic would only work if a company was about to immediately fire all their customer service reps after adoption which would be incredibly stupid. In practice they're gonna adopt it, wait a year, see how it works, then decide then after the guy who first proposed it is fired for driving up costs so much. Further the obvious question that arises is, why spend $2 / convo when you could just not? You gotta roll your own agent & write your own prompts anyway, and Agentforce is a bare-minimum chat gpt wrapper. Just make your own chatgpt wrapper and call it a day. $2 is the list price and not what anyone is paying as of now. $2 will make sense if a company is able to drive up any sense of automation with it. It makes sense for a business to reduce customer wait times and that's where something like this comes in. Exactly this - nobody’s paying $2. Why pay $2 a conversation when you could just not, I means it’s pretty simple, because every business that has a call centre has the headache of scale, calls don’t just nicely come in one after the other in a nice line so no one waits, and staffing can’t be adjusted at the drop of a second in order to handle surges If you can get a deflection rate reasonable enough that the agents can fully handle the customer interaction and they can be the 1 agent you need for the one call you get from 10pm - 4am but can also be the 50 concurrent calls you get between 2pm and 4pm without having to have rota’s, sickness, training people to manage those people and so on and so on it’s such and easy use case as to why you would implement and people just going “oh salesforce ai fad” and instantly dismissing it are clearly not understanding how business could use them You misunderstood the point I was making. Why pay $2 / convo for AI when you could use something else and pay like a fraction of a cent per convo. E.g. why use Agentforce when you can use Bedrock or OpenAI directly. I don't disagree with the last part, I was mostly just playing devil's advocate. Obviously the tool still has a long way to go, but that is the mindset that I think a lot of people are failing to look at when they hear that $2 per conversation thing. Time will tell and I think SFDC is probably putting the cart ahead of the horse, but ultimately that is the premise of all of this imo. i mean.  there's 60 minutes in an hour.   you're premise is  every service call takes a min of 5-6 minutes? in my exp the time you actually spend on the phone with someone is fairly short for most cust svc calls.     ...user exp  of waiting on hold,  navigating robo menus   ...may be a lot longer.    but it's why \"talking to someone\" is so valuable,   the time sink to get there is the fastest way to get something answered/resolved. if the average \"long\" call is 2 min,  and a fast call is sub 1 min.    that may push the average call volume for non-escalated issues to 30-40.   or give or take 50cents per incident. and that a per use AI  model is justified over a cost.  because people just love talking to an AI  vs  a crappy chat bot.     VS an AI service interaction that still has to be escalated to a human.  so now you're paying dbl??? Those numbers you're working with assume you have a perfect employee that is working at optimum efficiency. We all know that is not the case, so sure the call might average 1 to 3 minutes, but you know they're not immediately hopping back on to the next call. it's all info pulled out of our rears. i'm just questioning A.  this idea every customer svc person is making $20 an hour.  and B   every time on call is 5+ min.  such that 10 calls is a realistic expectation. when a simple demonstration that more than 10 calls isn't that hard numerically.    if that avg call time is less. Again, you are thinking of the number of calls purely by the length of the time that the person is on the phone. They're going to be follow-up tasks after a majority of cases that get opened/closed. People will work through those and then make themselves available again for the queue to send them another person to talk to. That is assuming they don't hop on their phone for a sec or run to the bathroom, grab a snack, etc. That $20 an hour cost is probably actually an underestimate. Sure, the rep typically isn't making that much as an hourly wage, but you have to factor in benefits, facility overhead, etc It's not quite as simple an equation as I think you're looking to make it. I will be the first to admit that AgentForce isn't currently where it needs to be, but this is the line of thinking that a lot of the reps are going to close deals using. Yes this high cost was a big problem. But just came to know from one of my friend working in Salesforce that very soon the pricing will be more flexible. Where if the agentforce will use hardly use llm rather call the api to get the answer (like for the question is there any product with name XX and answer is yes/no), the cost will be around 50 cents whereas if llm will be used to answer some complex queries, cost will be $3 Implemented it and after some major negotiations the agentforce usage price was converted to a flat fee. Major customer and estimated conversations monthly was around 100 000 - 200 000 so a flat fee of 10 000€ is way less what? they are charging by conversation? that's unseen",

EDIT: And the main risk most of us have is that the AI voice assistant just replaces current state call deflection at a much higher price point than current call deflection technology.  You still end up with as many calls going to humans as you did before.  In my experience calls that end up with humans are almost always going to end up with humans because those callers do not want any other result than a human (we are also seeing more and more sales where the only way we win the deal is if the customer is guaranteed a human support experience so eliminates even thinking about AI for them). I disagree bc that logic would only work if a company was about to immediately fire all their customer service reps after adoption which would be incredibly stupid. In practice they're gonna adopt it, wait a year, see how it works, then decide then after the guy who first proposed it is fired for driving up costs so much. Further the obvious question that arises is, why spend $2 / convo when you could just not? You gotta roll your own agent & write your own prompts anyway, and Agentforce is a bare-minimum chat gpt wrapper. Just make your own chatgpt wrapper and call it a day. $2 is the list price and not what anyone is paying as of now. $2 will make sense if a company is able to drive up any sense of automation with it. It makes sense for a business to reduce customer wait times and that's where something like this comes in. Exactly this - nobody’s paying $2. Why pay $2 a conversation when you could just not, I means it’s pretty simple, because every business that has a call centre has the headache of scale, calls don’t just nicely come in one after the other in a nice line so no one waits, and staffing can’t be adjusted at the drop of a second in order to handle surges If you can get a deflection rate reasonable enough that the agents can fully handle the customer interaction and they can be the 1 agent you need for the one call you get from 10pm - 4am but can also be the 50 concurrent calls you get between 2pm and 4pm without having to have rota’s, sickness, training people to manage those people and so on and so on it’s such and easy use case as to why you would implement and people just going “oh salesforce ai fad” and instantly dismissing it are clearly not understanding how business could use them You misunderstood the point I was making. Why pay $2 / convo for AI when you could use something else and pay like a fraction of a cent per convo. E.g. why use Agentforce when you can use Bedrock or OpenAI directly. I don't disagree with the last part, I was mostly just playing devil's advocate. Obviously the tool still has a long way to go, but that is the mindset that I think a lot of people are failing to look at when they hear that $2 per conversation thing. Time will tell and I think SFDC is probably putting the cart ahead of the horse, but ultimately that is the premise of all of this imo. i mean.  there's 60 minutes in an hour.   you're premise is  every service call takes a min of 5-6 minutes? in my exp the time you actually spend on the phone with someone is fairly short for most cust svc calls.     ...user exp  of waiting on hold,  navigating robo menus   ...may be a lot longer.    but it's why \"talking to someone\" is so valuable,   the time sink to get there is the fastest way to get something answered/resolved. if the average \"long\" call is 2 min,  and a fast call is sub 1 min.    that may push the average call volume for non-escalated issues to 30-40.   or give or take 50cents per incident. and that a per use AI  model is justified over a cost.  because people just love talking to an AI  vs  a crappy chat bot.

Again, you are thinking of the number of calls purely by the length of the time that the person is on the phone. They're going to be follow-up tasks after a majority of cases that get opened/closed. People will work through those and then make themselves available again for the queue to send them another person to talk to. That is assuming they don't hop on their phone for a sec or run to the bathroom, grab a snack, etc. That $20 an hour cost is probably actually an underestimate. Sure, the rep typically isn't making that much as an hourly wage, but you have to factor in benefits, facility overhead, etc It's not quite as simple an equation as I think you're looking to make it.

      "commentBody": "Yes. Implemented for a few customers. It works mostly as intended. Takes a little more configuration than they make it seem, but it works. In six months it will be great. May I ask about your use cases? I’m starting to think there’s just too many requirements for mine and so it’s not working well. I’ve made many flows, custom actions and input variables but am not quite getting the expected results. Also super frustrating that it can’t produce a hyperlink. also super frustrating that it can’t produce a hyperlink Not sure what your use case is or where you’re struggling, but the functionality definitely exists to render hyperlinks. https://youtu.be/h91NcTNQFYY?si=fZjVfPCpGujvuWru Yes I followed those instructions and it does not work. Leads me to think that is some special Salesforce org. This wasn’t in any documentation but to allow hyperlinks you need to add ‘#AllowMarkdown#’ in the agent description What!? Not in the documentation? That can't be! It's a premium solution. It has to be there. Oh... It's salesforce. Wonder if there are org level settings that would conflict with this such as clickjack or other settings.  We have issues with links in our environment because of click jack settings.  Not familiar enough with the details though. You asked the question that nobody will answer.  Frustrating. Yes. We've done sales coach, out of the box with a few changes to the instructions.\nWe've done a sales SDR agent that is pretty simple.\nWe've done several service agents with a few embellishments.\nWe've done order status (no changes).\nWe've got a couple of demos that do real-world use cases pretty well. I've got one that sends a URL on a demo org if you want to try it. Go to www.thunderwatch.co and tell it you want to reset your password. Give it any email address. It's weird if you watch it because sometimes it will have the words \"password reset\" as a hyperlink and then it will re-render with the whole URL displayed. In fact, it does the same every time with any html the agent produces.",

I’m creating so many flows and actions to make it do what they want and they’re still expecting more. Have you got anything remotely working? We saw some demos but the rates were just not realistic for us to even entertain the idea. I have a service agent kind of working but it’s very sensitive and inconsistent. After about 4 instructions it becomes overloaded and performance becomes impacted. My biggest concern has been during testing it provides inconsistent responses, some expected and accurate and others completely wrong when there has been no change to setup. I’m hoping to meet with a solutions engineer this week to get more information. Combine all your instructions into a single instruction for better results Also something we've had a lot of success with is giving examples on why 123 would mean XYZ, and 456 would be ABC.  Then including instructions to consider the examples before making a final verdict. Helped a lot in our effort to categorize emails. Aren't we then just back to writing an sql that handles shit? Or some kind of power shell program? I interviewed to sell Agent Force and turned it down ultimately bc nobody could fucking explain it to me. My biggest concern has been during testing it provides inconsistent responses This is a problem in every AI solution and something I've found impossible to explain to people that think of AI in the context of past linear solutions.  We have a pretty reliable email processing external integration but I've multiple times had to answer \"why X and not Y\" and then we run it again and we get Y as we'd of thought.  But run it another 20 times and you eventually get X again one time. That will be an ongoing challenge for AI; Agentforce or not. Yeah it’s way too expensive for what it “could” do. Hard pass over here too. Yeah the rates are wayyyy too high to make it worth it. To be fair we have an internal team that manages our own AI. Our calls for the internal bot cost about 0.11 From experience you are probably moving faster and delivering more than you would with other AI solutions where you have to think out how to build every feature that Agentforce has already thought out for you.  We have pretty robust AI internally but waiting months for those to be built out so we can use them in an integrated model.  I'd take Agentforce over it honestly but no one wants to have a Salesforce contract conversation about AI when you are investing in your own AI. Might be a good idea to try out clientell.ai to auto create these flows ;)",

      "commentBody": "I’m going to follow this post. Happy to potentially help make sure you’re each getting the help you need regarding Agents. I work at SF Where's the best practice prompt libraries? Would love that What is the most valuable use case you are seeing? While this is tough to answer because customers are finding value in it for multiple departments/use cases, I am seeing a general consensus on customers loving it for the customer support /CS agent. All things ticketing, case deflection and routing, and knowledge article suggestion and creation. I don’t see why people would spend a ton of money implementing when you can build a CS bot in zendesk for cheap. And again-this is a total non answer. Just want to make sure I’m answering your question, are you saying my previous response wasn’t an answer? Define “a ton of money implementing” … there are certain partners in the ecosystem right now that are implementing agents for free. If you get with your account team from SF they can probably help bridge that gap. Getting some of these agents off the ground are a lighter lift than you might think, and more specifically to the Zendesk comment I’m sure theirs makes sense specially to said use case, but as you know a lot of companies are looking for a broader agent ecosystem than spans their entire company (marketing sales etc) so that’s a clear differentiator of SF. All I’m asking is for a specific use case Plenty of use cases out there. To expand further on my CS/Support side. You can prompt Agentforce to write a draft knowledge article for you based on what was solved in the case rather than having someone write a knowledge article from scratch. Doesn’t sound like anything that’s a game changer. And again even when I interviewed to sell agent force nobody could tell me how currently clients were using it. I hear you, it’s literally 1 of many so hard to make a blanket statement one way or another. I’d say stay close to the ecosystem and you’ll continue to see stories.

The agent has full access of knowledge and handles 2/3 of the requests, other either create a case via the agent or are handed over to a live agent. Can I ask how you structured your Knowledge Base to do this effectively? Im afraid I can’t. I work as an SE not in the delivery. But some of them I did the demo. I honestly did not have any big structure in my knowledge articles. I just created them and use the the standard topic and actions which queries the knowledge base. I can’t tell if it it’s technical required to have a structure knowledge base. But I’d say it’s not bad to have it .",

It all depends on the use case and if it is a good fit for it or not. The main problem I have seen is when people try to implement an agent for the sake of it not because it makes sense from a functional and practical perspective So which agents work well? Could you provide high level use cases? Unfortunately, that seems to be what most C-level people seem to want to do with it. And a lot of that is driven by Salesforce’s own marketing Name one good/powerful one. Just one.",

      "commentBody": "I've been trying a few POCs in one of the new Agentforce-enable dev orgs. Some use cases are simply better suited than others and it's a matter of recognizing when the thing you're working on might not be one of them. I was impressed when I opened my org in the Salesforce app on my phone and typed just the name of a Contact into the Agentforce chat. Without any customization, just OOB config, it responded with an excellent summary of the record and links to related items. Just that capability alone would improve the experience for my mobile users who work in the field - but probably not justify the additional cost of an Agentforce license (whatever it's called lately.) We are a nonprofit that provides services to homebound seniors. Summarizing records, drafting emails, suggesting next actions - Agentforce does a great job without too much hefty configuration. But our pain point is data entry. Closing a case is as an easy action. But guiding a user through completing data entry for a task that has a lot of possible outcomes is a different matter. A lot of fine-tuned instructions are needed to provide the correct context. I still haven't found a way to get an agent to pass the recordId into a flow reliably. It often passes the record name, despite numerous instructions to use the recordId. So I had to build something into the flow to handle that. I finally built out a topic with actions to open a work order, add items to a work order, close a work order, or cancel a work order. But honestly - a collection of Action buttons on the record page is much easier to configure, does the job more reliably, AND is more user friendly. At the end of the day, generative AI is not deterministic. The same prompt does NOT generate the exact same response every time. This is actually one of its strengths for brainstorming and creative work because you can quickly generate a bunch of alternatives. But it's something that needs to be closely directed if you're going to harness it for data entry with lots of inputs. You probably need to train it with a broad range of sample inputs and expected outputs, which you could do in instructions, and the agent builder might add something like this in due course. But right now, I find myself writing multiple flows to support an agent to replace a single screen flow. I'm sure Agentforce will get better. And I hope I will get better at building for it. I'm really to have a dev org to work in. But in production, it's still flows and actions.",

      "commentBody": "$2 is an option but most clients will opt out for flex credits. Flex credits will typically be cheaper based on actions. For example, if you ask “I need towels” the agent will respond accordingly and cost you like .25 cents. The more actions you have in your agent response the more costly. Rag 2.0 is coming out shortly which will help a lot of the  mixed results people are seeing. A lot of companies are loading the instructions with a ton of business rules. Don’t do this especially if the question can be answered every time. No need for an agent.",

      "commentBody": "It doesn’t work. We are rolling our own LLM out against the CRM schema and finding much better results. Agentforce is just dumb as rocks and has zero awareness of where the user is in the CRM. You can open agentforce on an account detail, opportunity detail or any detail page and it has zero context for the logged in user. Training agentforce to know what it should know out of the box is an embarrassment. The fact you can’t bring your own model and have to use OpenAI is not acceptable for enterprise customers. If you have a single hard-coded use case, better off writing a flow  to listen for the conditions to take action on records. It will be over a year before Salesforce figures out we can’t be forced to purchase data cloud and Einstein credits to leverage a LLM that is dumb as rocks. You will get better results pulling the CRM data into an EDW like Snowflake and leveraging the LLM there and just send API calls back to LWC.. Don’t early adopt this product, hire a few engineers instead. How can you write that? That is simply not true. You can either choose Open AI or Antropic or bring you own LLM. Link : \nOn top of that if you use Agentforce like a Copilot for internal Usecase, it has awareness about where the is. \nIf you are in an account and ask for a list of Opportunities, you get a list of Opportunities from that account. You can even spin it further: if you use Maps Agentforce can do actions based on the real world location of the user. (Eg check-ins, meeting notes etc…) Not accurate. Completely hallucinates and has zero context of the page it’s on. Tested against 5 LLMs and it’s the worst performing against CRM data. You shouldn’t have to write prompts to help it understand the schema and you shouldn’t need data cloud at all. Agentforce Models All Agentforce reasoning engine calls use OpenAI GPT-4o, and in some cases Azure OpenAI GPT-4o. You can’t select a different model for AI agents. However, a custom action that uses a prompt template, Apex, or the Models API can reference any Salesforce-managed or BYO model. I’m referring to the fact you cannot select a different model for AI Agents..straight from the link you shared. If you already have a stack of AWS Bedrock + external data.. you have way more flexibility for pennies on the dollar. Doesn’t work natively with multi-org even via data cloud. No ability to cache data, no memory of previous conversations without writing records. This is just incorrect. Page context has been there for months and I’ve used it actively - you are really out of date here Have it running in a sandbox.. how is it setting context? If you want to ado anything that’s not an out of the box use case you are writing code or flows. Salesforce employee here, I agree with the others that replied to your comment that what you’re saying isn’t accurate. Have you worked with your AE to better understand capabilities? We have additional resources they can bring in to help make sure you’re getting what you need and that you’re also following best practices. I appreciate that. I visited the offices in San Fran and it didn’t perform well in love demos unless the responses were canned. Open a oppty detail page. Ask agentforce what’s the average sales cycle for opportunities on this account. Please report back your honest results.",
