    "postTitle": "Should I continue in CRM after my multinational internship?",
    "postMessage": "Hi everyone, I’m currently completing a Master’s in International Strategic Marketing  and did my internship at multinational in Data & CRM Marketing. During my time there, I:\n    • Worked on Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Adobe Campaign, and Mailchimp for CRM campaigns.\n    • Built data-driven segmentations and analyzed performance with Power BI & Looker Studio.\n    • Helped re-engage unsubscribed customers through retargeting flows.\n    • Created automated journeys, newsletters, and optimized campaigns using Einstein AI. Now I’m wondering:\n    • Do you think it’s a good idea to continue my career path in CRM & Marketing Automation?\n    • Which certifications would you recommend (Salesforce, Adobe, or others)?\n    • Should I focus more on email marketing & automation or broaden into other CRM-related areas? I’d love to hear your thoughts from people already working in CRM/Salesforce/Marketing Automation. Thanks a lot!",

However, that's usually because people are transitioning out of a different industry and trying to get into Salesforce with zero experience and just a cert. Given that you have experience with the platform, it will still be tough landing a first job but you already have a leg up. I'd recommend getting your admin cert but you should still apply to jobs to see what kind of traction you get",
