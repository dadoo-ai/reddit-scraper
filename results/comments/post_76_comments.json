    "postMessage": "Hello! I just completed my admin exam, upon submission a page flashed up saying ‘pass’ and listed percentages - I was excited so didn’t really read it but I’ve gone to see my certificate on the trailhead academy website and it is saying pending score. Now I’m questioning if I just saw a page that explains what you need to pass and got excited for no reason. Please can someone confirm their experience if it told them straight away if they passed or failed when they submitted the exam?",

I’m going to guess the delay is due to review of the recordings to make sure nothing raises a flag. That’s just my guess but the delay is the new normal \n\nAnd congrats on passing the test!",
