      "commentBody": "To disable OAuth Device Flow you need to uncheck \"Enable OAuth Login from browser\" in your Data Loader settings. Once unchecked, data loader will default to oauth web server flow when using OAuth to login. Or, you can update to the new version of Data Loader once it is released by Salesforce. The new version will not allow Oauth device flow. \n\n[https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005132367&amp;type=1](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005132367&amp;type=1)",

      "commentBody": "Salesforce is deprecating Device Flow, so you’ll need to switch to OAuth (Web Server Flow) with a connected app. In Data Loader, pick OAuth, hit Advanced, and point it to your custom domain (so it routes through SSO). Make sure your admin has a connected app set up with the callback URL sfdc://success and that it’s allowed in your IdP. Once that’s in place and you’re on the latest Data Loader version, it should redirect you to your SSO login instead of using Device Flow.",
