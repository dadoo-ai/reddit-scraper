    "postMessage": "I attended a hands-on Agentforce training today. I didn't really know much about Co-Pilot/Agentforce beforehand. It seems nice, but I didn't know you have to get Data Cloud in order to get Agentforce. I don't work at a company that's looking to buy this and I can't imagine most companies would want to buy it. Organizations already spend so much money on Salesforce. Would it actually be worth it...even 5-8 years from now after it's more developed.",

      "commentBody": "I've been on the platform for 14+ years at this point. Web 3.0, Chatter, Salesforce1, Salesforce + FB = Like, IoT, Google Glass integrations, Salesforce Offline, Salesforce Mobile...err Heroku integrations, Einstein EVERYTHING. Salesforce is really really big on promoting novel concepts that rarely if ever significantly impact the pipeline or builds. A part of that is putting them behind paywalls, a part is market does not need developments in the area. It's good to know about current and future initiatives, but Salesforce makes an acquisition or development and tries to push it hard. These concepts are often under developed when they hit general public. A better way to build customer facing bots and LLM integration to salesforce sounds like a no brainer currently, but I'm assuming will only be released to higher end customers, where security becomes stifling issue. 16 year vet here and im still spending most of my days building on core and bashing heads to use screensflows to enter data! probably will have some currency and use but at the same time it all feels very flavour of the week in true Salesforce style Don’t forget Wave Analytics! Wave Analytics became CRM Analytics which I guess is now becoming Tableau Einstein, so I don’t really think I would categorize it as a flash-in-the-pan. Fair enough. Wave became Einstein Analytics, which became CRM Analytics but now they're pushing Tableau, which is a different platform. They've sold it to many companies so they're all looking for experienced Tableau people. I'm just not interested in that. I love focusing on the platform itself. Salesforce wants everything and for us Admins trying to keep up with all of them while in the job market (14 years here and foolishly went to startups) is painful. Yeah, I attended Dreamforce and heard the messaging about Tableau Einstein. We’ve built out a lot in CRM Analytics, so it will be interesting to see the path forward. Yeah, no one uses it. They can't sell it. I see them like a car manufacturer, who when any new technology comes out, they put it in the car. \nMicrowave? Put it in the car and charge $1000/month...someone will pay. Don't forget blockchainforce and NFTforce...or whatever they called that. Oh man I forgot all about NFT Cloud...as did everyone else. I still can't believe they have the guts to say they have a Marketing Cloud integration. Last I checked it was literally able to pick up a csv from an ftp. Zero direct two way integration with salesforce. I can't believe I'm saying something positive about Marketing Cloud, but it does have a built in integration w/ Salesforce.  And if you send emails in a particular way, it will write back to SF, so it can be 2 way. Very possible, my information at this point is...5 years old, I do recall constant log outs, that it could only write to...the activity record I think and to pull in data from a report it HAD to be a Contact based report. In all honesty I cant think of anything less creative then using AI for some chat bot. This tech is billion years old already and when people have problems they tend to want to speak to people. Working through 5 minutes to get to a person is a horrible customer experience It's basically the only aspect a company can cut without looking at management at this point. Steam, google, facebook. There's no phone numbers to call. They want to like the plague avoid interact with you directly. Salesforce phone support was always a 20-30 minute wait on a looping single song. I think enterprise support phone team at one point was something like 7 people. Yeah SF support hella shit experience. Just posting a case for their support is clunky. Whatever happened to IoT? Contrary to Marc's story, most people don't want their toothbrush reporting to the dentist how often they actually brush, and the dentist doesn't really care. 22 years in a row... putting the \"dream\" in Dreamforce. :-) There's always some consumer tech trend happening that gets projected onto enterprise software. Except this time the threat is very real. AI isn't just a passing fad. When Ex-Co-CEOs are launching AI companies to build better customer relationship agents, the stakes are high. CRM is forever changed. I don't think anyone is doubting the advancement of AIs...but the integration patterns are still the same, the hardware is still the same. People are still trying to find market share by reducing overheads and automating customer interaction. That Data Cloud is still what...150k a year, rules it out to majority of mid level businesses. I have not looked into Agent Force at all, but I'm guessing there was another random acquisition with non-existent integration. Data cloud credits are included in Einstein for service",

Except this time the threat is very real. AI isn't just a passing fad. When Ex-Co-CEOs are launching AI companies to build better customer relationship agents, the stakes are high. CRM is forever changed. I don't think anyone is doubting the advancement of AIs...but the integration patterns are still the same, the hardware is still the same. People are still trying to find market share by reducing overheads and automating customer interaction. That Data Cloud is still what...150k a year, rules it out to majority of mid level businesses. I have not looked into Agent Force at all, but I'm guessing there was another random acquisition with non-existent integration. Data cloud credits are included in Einstein for service",

      "commentBody": "Data Cloud provisioning is probably required but it's free on EE+. You don't have to go 100% all in if you don't want to. Data Cloud is literally free to start with. Data Cloud is only required in a big way if you want to include RAG cases. Otherwise it's essentially just there to dump the audit trail into from the LLM responses. What could RAG cases be? Specifically for Data Cloud, RAG is working on unstructured data; think PDFs of knowledge articles, or policy documents, or call transcripts. Once this is consumed into DC's vector database, you can run semantic search against it - ie. Searching for meaning, not keywords. This can then be rolled into the prompts that Agentforce uses to take action/reason. I’m looking at the cost of the integration consultant we’re using and the Data Cloud consumption rate card and thinking otherwise. Sure, you can manage the cost but go into this with your eyes open. Don’t integrate everything just because you can. Focus on your actual use cases and build from there. I’ve been wanting to learn data cloud and get certified. Besides the trailhead is there anything that’s really helpful from ground 0?",

      "commentBody": "The same place that still allows for a ‘switch to Classic’? lol In reality, it may be the future, but it will be slow and likely behind the curve of other AI innovations. For right now, it’s mostly good marketing material. I’d be happy to be wrong though as the SF space could use a bit of a spark. Never mind switch to classic, you can still disable classic in the UI settings and go back to the pre-2010 UI! Can you really?? I have users that fight use Lightning and only use Classic. Could be a good prank to force them to use an ever older interface. Be careful, they might like it more. For me, I fought the \"Classic\" crowd by only implementing features in Lightning. \"Oh that new screen flow? Yeah, that's a Lightning only feature\". That’s the approach I’m taking in this org. Forcing them little by little. I miss classic, I move faster in that UI 🤣 I'm with you. Lightning is such a clusterfuck and often sooooo slow. Agreed, the top reason I delayed moving my org over was how much more I enjoy the Classic Admin UI. Classic was/is so fast... but any new features like Data Cloud or Agent Force are not even available in classic... this makes me sad... You could easily screenscrape Classic UI to get things done which never have API implemented. It is nightmare to try to screenscrape Lightning UI to enable Data Cloud or anything like that... I actually didn’t realize that. Gotta love it. This further establishes my point. Salesforce has to support a user base still using functionality from 15+ years ago which makes it tough to drive the newer items such as AI, which means they will always be a bit slower than other companies despite what the marketing materials say. A part of that is they do not match past material. Documents were a great functionality to publically host images, that's unmatched by Chatter or Static Resources. We can talk about sandboxes going away for sfdx (now sf) but there's still no way to replicate a full org as far as I know. SFDX hit GA in 2018. Okay where is this setting? I haven’t been able to identify it. Swap to Classic. Go to Setup -> Customize -> User Interface. Uncheck \"Enable the Salesforce Classic 2010 User Interface Theme\". Bask in the glory of the 00s. Can you list the exact steps to do this? I would like to play a prank in that case. :D Swap to Classic Go to Setup -> User Interface Deselect \"Enable the Salesforce Classic 2010 User Interface Theme\"",

A part of that is they do not match past material. Documents were a great functionality to publically host images, that's unmatched by Chatter or Static Resources. We can talk about sandboxes going away for sfdx (now sf) but there's still no way to replicate a full org as far as I know. SFDX hit GA in 2018.",

They want a piece of the LLM pie, they still want Einstein to sell more, and they want to satisfy the investors who say AI is everything. While it satisfies that BS for the time being - it'll be used to try and build various features, offerings, and products. They'll prototype various things, some in private, some as new features on the app. After x amount of years, they'll keep what works, file that into their absurd licensing and feature structure, and Agentforce's success becomes entirely optional at that point.

      "commentBody": "My essential issue with this and everything else with Salesforce is once you've gotten them in on a multi year contract, anything you want to do is an upsell. There is literally zero effort or focus from them to help the client maximize what they've already paid for. In my opinion, once you build trust and real partnership helping me maximize what I'm paying for already, that's when I'll be willing to pay more to use your new stuff. Till then, please don't badger me with half baked shit. The problem is that the SF AE's always have agressive sales targets they need to hit to keep their job.  There is very little incentive for them to help their clients maximize their ROI.  This is why SI partners are so valuable and often become the trusted partner in lieu of Salesforce who is always just trying to sell whatever new shiny object. Experiencing this now, bigtime. I am working in an org that was not rolled out well, at all. I'm cleaning up stuff and stabilizing, and let our AE know that agentforce doesn't really do anything to help us currently (small-ish to almost mid-sized, just use sales cloud, there's no way in hell we get our sales people to use AI to coach their sales process). AE still pushing and pushing to figure out use cases we might have. I empathize with you. The other slimy thing they'll do is go behind you and look for your boss or your business and get them to push you to buy more or tell them that they have the next best thing since sliced bread but you don't see it yet. Stuff like that. I understand it's business and it's sales but not pleasant for the ones on the receiving side. When I worked for a studio in LA, Salesforce people sneaked onto the lot one time (behind my manager's back; she was in charge of Salesforce development for the studio more or less) to talk to a director of a division who wasn't using Salesforce at the time to push her to bring them in for a demo. It ticked her off so much she threatened to get rid of Salesforce. And yes, Salesforce will happily denigrate your position with higher ups for crap you know you don't need but they convince C level types that your company NEEDS RIGHT NOW. I'm really doubting the value of sales coach.  Aside from providing data points, I'm not going to practice my pitch with AI or do a negotiation practice run.  Just seems silly and pie in the sky. I cannot imagine what scenario in which I would attempt to roll that feature out to our sales people. The nicest response would be “uh, gfym dude”. I'm a sales person myself and ya, gfym is accurate! lol. Predictive insights is helpful but \"coaching\" is f'n silly.  Proactively sharing knowledge articles would be helpful if it actually provides the correct content... Helpful insights would be \"My model tells me this next guy you're about to call is nuttier than squirrel shit. Here are some conspiracy theories from Infowars to be familiar with and talking points, should they arise. Advice, if you have a trucker hat that has a corporate logo on it, wear it in the call. Use the phrase 'Shit yeh, bro' a couple times\". THEN Agentforce would sell like an mf'er. LMFAO!  I like you.",

      "commentBody": "I just think, from the customer perspective, have I ever found a chatbot to be a satisfying user experience? Nope nope nope. It tends to be a rather insulting experience, putting a layer between me and actually doing the thing I want to accomplish or reaching the person I need to reach. I'd rather fill in a form than have a bot spoonfeed me the form step by step, and I'd rather be trusted when I say that I have a problem requiring a human to solve it. I think we are going to find that the rush to adopt AI agents will be stalled as they consistently turn out to be unfit for purpose and/or detrimental to customer sentiment. So much this - have an internet autage right now, was such a pain navigating through all the chat and voice bits telling me to visit some site to check if it solves it. Telling those agents i want to talk to a person did not work so I had to endure their bullshit until finally today I was able to reach someone",

If Salesforce has found a way to do that then it will be as useful as anyone is willing to make it. Perhaps there are cheaper or simpler ways to do the above, but if you’re committed, or at least already taking advantage of, the value that Salesforce can and has brought… then Agentforce is the future of Salesforce just like Einstein, or Flow, or whatever else, was. leveraging in-house data this is the crux of the issue.  Its hard to get into a position where your organization has clean usable data.  But if you can get there its going to unlock a huge amount of operational efficiency I'm curious at agentforce/salesforce AIs ability to interpret and structure unstructured data, something I'm starting to look into more for a few projects. Once that can be done in a cost effective way, it's a cool thing to think about That's why Data Cloud is a core requirement. That’s exactly what Data Cloud solves for. You don’t need to clean your data. Let Data Cloud do the harmonisation.",

      "commentBody": "It’s a misconception, you DO NOT NEED Data Cloud to use Agentforce. Everything thing I've learned so far suggest you do. Can you link something about how you could deploy AF with just on platform data? You don’t, you only need data cloud if you’re trying to harmonize a bunch of 3rd party data I didn't even see yet where you can configure it without enabling DC first, fair enough But even if you can, what's the quality of AI or LLM results if you do not have a very large set of data to inform it? That's the key, I think. That's why Salesforce is pushing Data Cloud+AI. Because they understand, AI is kinda meh if you are just feeding it with a few standard and custom objects. They need customers to be hoarding data and not trying to just shove it all in the CRM. Read the official agentforce deck, this was literally one of the FAQ at the end of the deck and they explicitly called it out. Agentforce doesn’t require Data cloud licenses to work. There are certain advanced use cases though like RAG, reporting on Einstein Trust Layer, model builder etc, which requires Data Cloud. Have you got a link to the deck? Not doubting you but I was at the Agentforce event in London yesterday and they heavily pushed DC as a prerequisite in most of the talks I attended. I forgot about RAG. Can you build a knowledge base without data cloud? I know you need it if you want to integrate with Google drive and train on your internal documents. My suspicion is that there is probably a fine line between can you use it without Data Cloud and does it *work* without Data Cloud. They may allow users to use a subset of features in AgentForce without access to a data cloud (DC or otherwise) but if you've got any feature involving LLM or generative functions, I'd expect you need to get your Data Cloud environment in order first. So maybe my question is more: What are the use cases of AgentForce running without DC or any external LLM or data sourcing? Sending request to LLM and receiving response (use cases around common LLM conversations I.e.  grounding with structured data ) has nothing to do with Data Cloud. If want to use unstructured data like emails, knowledge articles, chat conversations, pdfs in your LLM request then you need Data Cloud) Data Cloud isn't just for unstructured data. It's a suite of tools so you can model both your CRM data and any external structured or unstructured data sources. I think it's a stretch to suggest that AI and LLM conversations have nothing to do with Data Cloud if that implies you're going to pursue successful results with data you have just in standard and custom objects. Sure, Salesforce brands a lot of features now as \"Einstein\" and \"AI\" on features that have been in the system well before ChatGPT.  I'm still skeptical about deploying anything generative with quality results without a baseline of large, qualified data. Doesn't mean they won't let you try, though, I guess. You are misinterpreting my post. In the context of Agentforce, I said that processing unstructured data would definitely require Data Cloud.  You can’t do it with Einstein Licenses alone. Of course Data Cloud  offers variety of features including structured and unstructured data from different sources. The original question was does Agentforce need Data Cloud as a pre requisite to work. The answer is No. Fair enough Not really true... if you want to buy agentforce from salesforce in the upcoming GA, you will need a data cloud provisioning in order to allow that to work What about using an alternative to DataCloud like SAP Analytics along with Mulesoft?",

          "commentBody": "My suspicion is that there is probably a fine line between can you use it without Data Cloud and does it *work* without Data Cloud. They may allow users to use a subset of features in AgentForce without access to a data cloud (DC or otherwise) but if you've got any feature involving LLM or generative functions, I'd expect you need to get your Data Cloud environment in order first. So maybe my question is more: What are the use cases of AgentForce running without DC or any external LLM or data sourcing? Sending request to LLM and receiving response (use cases around common LLM conversations I.e.  grounding with structured data ) has nothing to do with Data Cloud. If want to use unstructured data like emails, knowledge articles, chat conversations, pdfs in your LLM request then you need Data Cloud) Data Cloud isn't just for unstructured data. It's a suite of tools so you can model both your CRM data and any external structured or unstructured data sources. I think it's a stretch to suggest that AI and LLM conversations have nothing to do with Data Cloud if that implies you're going to pursue successful results with data you have just in standard and custom objects. Sure, Salesforce brands a lot of features now as \"Einstein\" and \"AI\" on features that have been in the system well before ChatGPT.  I'm still skeptical about deploying anything generative with quality results without a baseline of large, qualified data. Doesn't mean they won't let you try, though, I guess. You are misinterpreting my post. In the context of Agentforce, I said that processing unstructured data would definitely require Data Cloud.  You can’t do it with Einstein Licenses alone. Of course Data Cloud  offers variety of features including structured and unstructured data from different sources. The original question was does Agentforce need Data Cloud as a pre requisite to work. The answer is No. Fair enough",

I like the way they approached prompt builder last year though: Salesforce builds the connector & integration to LLM and admins can use it with flow to summarize/extract data from past records, etc. From my xp with PB, I did a POC for a fortune 500 client, eventhough client was fine with the dogshit performance (load a prompt can take 2 mns), Client did not pick it bc Salesforce did not know how to price it, nor their architect knew how to improve it (chunking, prompt structuring, etc). Now for Agentforce im puzzled -> I think 2 USD / Convo is expensive and if perf is similar as PB's, the product is 100% dead on arrival. If you want to have your question answered, i recommend you build a POC if you re a partner, hence you ll know if Bennioff's speech was worth its carbon print. Good luck guys !",

Even mobile apps will be replaced by AI Agents where we as humans will only interact with agents in natural language and the agents will interact with multiple apps to do what is asked Same way at Enterprise level, SFDC is perfectly placed as a platform to provide AI Agents to business users to do their business tasks without interacting with the tool directly. UI will become irrelevant in future because everyone will interact only with Agents This is such a bad take.  Find and order something from Amazon and tell me if that would have been better with a chat bot",
