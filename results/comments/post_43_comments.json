Not getting much guidance from support or AE so wanted to see if anybody here has any guidance. The end users need to be able to access the standard case object. We are looking at possible dropping some licenses and I don’t want to drop these. Not opposed to changing licenses as long as we keep the functionality. Currently most users are platform licenses.",

We also use the recently offered Platform Login licenses, but these use a different license that enables access to Cases which makes things kind of annoying because it makes switching people between Login and traditional Platform licenses tricky. Luckily, some User Access Policies usually take care of it for us.",

I’ve never bought licenses from a reseller, but that sounds like the reason for the discrepancy to me. If you want to prove it, ask you AE to spot you a small number of Platform licenses for one month as a test and see if the license count increases with them (I’m pretty sure it will).",

      "commentBody": "It is probably listed as “Company communities” which is a deprecated license type replaced by platform license + a permission set license. See: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000381799&amp;type=1\n\nIf you had the old license in your contract then they likely converted it to the new combo equivalent. \n\nThis may also be listed as a platform license and a separate line for Company Community for Lightning Platform permission set license or a single line for Salesforce Platform Starter/Plus license depending on the age of your org.\n\nYou should ask for a detailed list of skus and licenses for the org renewal - if it is a 1:1 renewal and you change nothing you should be ok. If you remove products obviously you want to make sure you keep these. If you still can’t sort it out posting the sku list with license count and entitlements/licenses from company info  might get you a more definitive response.\n\nUnfortunately many AEs know nothing about permission set licenses, so I wish you good luck!",

It's just crazy to think that AEs are selling you licenses that they don't even know what's included in them or how to support you when you ask questions related to what's included in these licenses, and if I remove this, what happens? It is also crazy to think there is no way to test this. I asked if we could remove these specific licenses and whatever perm lic set goes with it in the sandbox, and they basically said it is not possible.",
