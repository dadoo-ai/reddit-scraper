    "postMessage": "I’m in Dallas and trying to decide if it’s worth taking the day to check out the Agentforce World Tour. Mainly looking to learn more about their tech and see if it could help my company. The networking could be a bonus too, but I’m not sure if it’s worth the time. Anyone been to one of these events before? Is it solid or just a marketing thing? Also, anyone else planning to go? If I end up going, maybe we could link up while we’re there.",

And, if registration is free, there's no harm done if you sign up and decide not to go. Marketing-wise, skip the keynote, but smaller sessions can be helpful. Good point. In tech conferences, the keynotes are usually for sales, and the smaller ones are more for end-users.",

I'm essentially a solo admin and don't get to hang out with Salesforce types very often. I didn't bother building an agent because I've done all the Trailhead quickies. I doubt I'll ever be a customer for Agentforce, but I enjoy watching the glitzy demos because I can get ideas of things I could try to build, even without the shiny new thing. And the free food and wine at the networking session was very welcome. Would I have paid to go? Heck, no! But it was free and fun. I try to bring a plushie home for my dog from every event I go to. My boy got his Einstein this time. yeah, it’s a completely different story when you go with the idea of enjoying the day compared to when you have to go with a precise objective assigned by your boss.",

I basically approach it like some people plan Disney trips. Every minute is booked. If you don’t plan, then you will think it’s a waste of time.",

It has a different feel than other world tour and Dreamforce events I've attended. Yes, it is a \"marketing\" event in a manner of speaking, but also a good way to spend a few hours on what seems like a pretty interesting instantiation of something that can make Salesforce usage a lot easier and automated. totally agree. If you don’t go in with a plan, you just end up aimlessly wandering.",

Now they are just a giant waste of time. when was your last one? I’ve been to Dreamforce twice, but I’ve never attended a World Tour. This past summer. ok, thanks!",

This is a fun koolaid event for those of us who have networks in the ecosystem to meet and hang out. and it's where companies try to outshine one another with fancy demos. none more than Salesforce. Your best bet to see if Salesforce is effective for you is to clearly map out your processes and speak with independent non-biased (not Salesforce partnered) consultants to understand if what you do is easily done with Salesforce. And if it is, what licenses you would need, how much that would roughly cost, and how much implementation and ongoing support costs you can expect. That will not happen at the world tour sadly. thanks for the detailed insight! Out of curiosity, where do you think is the best place to find those kinds of consultants outside events like this? I pride myself on being one of those :) feel free to poke me! I’m also one (formerly at SF and a larger partner) before going on my own. I attended the NY event and echo what’s been said here. Happy to chat!",
