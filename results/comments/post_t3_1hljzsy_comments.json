      "commentBody": "Reading through this, it seems a lot more like a 1.1, than a 2.0. It seems to simply upgrade some of the initial functionality - there's no inherent \"version 2\" qualities to it, I think. I do think that's a good approach though. Agentforce is a great concept, but will 100% need a few of these upgrades to make it function well in practice. So imo, all good, naming it 2.0 is a bit misleading though More like 0.2",
