    "postMessage": "RESOLVED - Sounds like I was trying to make it more complicated.  Sounds like using Sandbox is the best bet.  And I agree that automating would be ideal, but right now is not possible.  Thanks everyone! I was asked if this was possible. I haven't been able to find anything, but wanted to see if anyone had heard of anything that would achieve this. We have a very customized selling process. It's been very challenging for our agents to pick up the process. Is there some form of app or plugin that someone could activate that would allow them to work through the ordering process inside of Production without actually entering a order? Almost some form of sandbox without setting up the users in the sandbox. TIA",
