      "commentBody": "About 8 months ago we opened a support case with them. We had a 2gp package we knew was good (installed into multiple other boxes), but for whatever reason it just would not install into this sandbox. Random error code every time we tried. They requested the info required to reproduce the issue in another box, we sent them install links to all of the packages/versions they needed. We also provided them access to an internal test box where all those packages/versions where installed (just so they could see there was no requirements conflict). The support team works the problem for a few days, says they can't get it to fail in their box either. Request access to the box we're having issues with. UAT for this client is supposed to start in less than a week, so we go with it. Figure maybe they can figure out what magic switch needs flipped. At this point the org is basically ready to go. All the metadata and config is done, data is in there, we're just waiting on that package so we can load a handful more items that require this final package. Our packages have a specific dependency chain (A>B>C. Package C was failing). We provided them links for the specific versions for each package that were stable, tested, and approved for production release. Guy pops in, tries the install. It fails. So in all his infinite wisdom, he starts looking at the versions of packages A and B. I guess they can see all the built versions of packages, so he's able to access an install link for package B. This build/link is all of 24 hours old, and contains a preliminary (alpha) build of a new set of features that hadn't even made it to QA yet. Decides he's going to install this version of package B, which completely destabilizes the entire org, leaving it in an unusable and non-recoverable state. For those not in the know, once you upgrade a managed package, you cannot downgrade it. Your only option is to uninstall (which, in essence, deletes all the data, and takes hours), or refresh the sandbox. They never asked for permission to upgrade that package. They never discussed the newer version with our team at all. Just did it. So obviously we're mad. We're in a position where cannot use that org for UAT. We're going to have to delay release for the client, and spend 100+ hours trying to migrate all this configuration to a new box. The best they can offer us is a 30 day temp full sandbox, which is no good for us because the project was scheduled to release in two stages, one in about 20 days, and another about 30 days after that. We keep trying to escalate the case. Get a case manager, literally anybody else to review the case. Zero movement. The guy just keeps telling us the org cannot be fixed and we should use the temp sandbox. It isn't until we finally reach out to the AE for our instance that we got somebody to actually reply to it, and the best they could do was extend the temp sandbox out a few months. We never did get any kind of resolution or information about why that employee considered unauthorized, non-reversable changes to the org state acceptable. Long story short, their support has taken a nosedive since their layoffs. Why would support be required to help you deploy in an instance where a single deploy is failing? That sounds like a problem with your environment. You need to sort that out, not support. It's not a deployment/change set where we're getting a validation error of some kind. Those we're plenty versed in. We often have to address minor issues when installing packages (typically X feature not enabled, or X limit needs bumped due to existing configuration not meshing with the package requirements). The package acts as a pre-validated change set in a way, so 95% of the time it drops into the org with no fuss. 4.5% of the time we can resolve without a case, or with a limit increase request. This was clearly in the 0.5% of the time where we got nothing back but \"Internal Error 123456789(13579)\". Those we often cannot resolve on our own. Typically we'll wait 2-24 hours and try again (sometimes unreported outages can cause issues), but if we get repeated failures with an identical error code, we'll log case to get insight into what error is being thrown that we cannot see. Normally with these, Salesforce corrects some odd nature of the org and we're good to go. These are things like \"That license type isn't available in here for some reason\" to \"There's a limit issue that wasn't being reported to you, but we increased it\". We have no option but to go to Salesforce for these, we physically lack the tools required to make the needed changes to correct the issue.",

          "commentBody": "Why would support be required to help you deploy in an instance where a single deploy is failing? That sounds like a problem with your environment. You need to sort that out, not support. It's not a deployment/change set where we're getting a validation error of some kind. Those we're plenty versed in. We often have to address minor issues when installing packages (typically X feature not enabled, or X limit needs bumped due to existing configuration not meshing with the package requirements). The package acts as a pre-validated change set in a way, so 95% of the time it drops into the org with no fuss. 4.5% of the time we can resolve without a case, or with a limit increase request. This was clearly in the 0.5% of the time where we got nothing back but \"Internal Error 123456789(13579)\". Those we often cannot resolve on our own. Typically we'll wait 2-24 hours and try again (sometimes unreported outages can cause issues), but if we get repeated failures with an identical error code, we'll log case to get insight into what error is being thrown that we cannot see. Normally with these, Salesforce corrects some odd nature of the org and we're good to go. These are things like \"That license type isn't available in here for some reason\" to \"There's a limit issue that wasn't being reported to you, but we increased it\". We have no option but to go to Salesforce for these, we physically lack the tools required to make the needed changes to correct the issue.",
