    "postMessage": "I’m trying to create an accounts without certain opportunities report. I used an Account report type with a cross filter Accounts without opportunities. Because there is a lot of data, i only want it to exclude certain users with open opps (so my sub filters are Opp Owner=those people, Open Opp=True). However, i created another report (Accounts with or without opportunities) to check myself, and somehow the cross filter or sub cross filters aren’t working. It is still pulling in Accounts with open opportunities owned by the users I specified. My brain is mush. Please help!",
