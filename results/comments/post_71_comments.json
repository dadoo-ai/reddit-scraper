    "postMessage": "I use the Salesforce Inpsector to query our salesforce data. I want to add comments to my saved SQQL queries, so that I can understand them when I return to them, without having to scrutinize every line. I write the one line comment like this: -- non 69 active contracts But when I try run a query with my comment I get an error MALFORMED_QUERY: unexpected token: '-' What am I doing wrong?",
