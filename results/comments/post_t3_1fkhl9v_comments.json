      "commentBody": "Agentforce is the rebranded Einstein Copilot. The rebranding happened about 6 weeks ago, according to the SEs I have spoken with at Dreamforce. Enhanced chatbot is probably the simplest accurate description for it. The way I like to think of it is a chat window that uses Einstein Copilot to give you or your customers answers grounded in your CRM data. Hi, Salesforce SE here- this is not accurate. While it is accurate that copilot functionality is moving to and being rebranded under Agentforce, Agentforce itself is absolutely not a rebrand of copilot. The underlying architecture is completely different, and is significantly more complex than what Copilot was. I think it was always the intention to get to this place, but the original copilot, in my opinion, was a bit lackluster. Agentforce is significantly more capable, and copilot is merely being moved onto this new architecture. I think copilot is now probably about 25% of Agentforce. Functionally, Copilot could only really work as an assistant to a human agent/employee. Agentforce agents can be customer/externally facing and work nearly completely autonomously in addition to being able to assist employees. At Dreamforce, we built Agentforce agents that could build other Agents for a customer.. and even we internally are just barely scratching the surface. Are there public resources on the autonomous capability and how to build it myself? You make it seem like agents can live outside the chat window and conduct complex workflows where somewhat logical reasoning in the middle changes the direction of the agent. Is this solely a flow with conditionals? Can I somehow model agentic workflows as a flow? Thanks! I‚Äôm actually not sure regarding public resources. There is a ‚Äúbuild an agent‚Äù trailhead with some basic setup that essentially covers the very basics of what I‚Äôm talking about, but to truly understand how this becomes sophisticated, it‚Äôs absolutely necessary to understand how the Salesforce platform works in and of itself.l as it pertains to data model, automations, and code. Without these things plugged into Agentforce, Agentforce would essentially just be a dumber LLM. The remarkably complex agentic capabilities the Agentforce can display are not within Agentforce itself- Agentforce is essentially an intelligent orchestrator of existing code and Flows, prompts, retrievers, etc. So for example, theoretically, you could say ‚Äúhey Agentforce, can you tell me the price of the most expensive home in contact Jon Smith‚Äôs neighborhood?‚Äù And Agentforce, with the correct actions assigned, would understand that it needs to find and read a contact called John Smith, get the zip code from the record, then call a flow/apex that uses an HTTP callout to call an external application that you would have already built to scrape whatever real estate site you want, pass the input from the ‚Äúget records‚Äù Flow into the external application, return the results and print them back to the agent, who responds to the question with the provided input. That‚Äôs just an example, but if you think about it, it‚Äôs not the agent executing most of what happened; it just interpreted the request, generated a plan based on actions it has available to it, executed the platform components necessary to answer the request, and recited the output. The existing salesforce platform capabilities played the biggest role in actually allowing the agent to get all of that information; the agent creates the plan and  takes the actions. All together, the results can be extremely complex, this was just one example. Hope that helps. Very helpful thanks. It does seem a bit agentic, in that if I equip it with the right tools- it can produce emergent behaviors / actions with those tools. This is true if your Jon Smith example isn‚Äôt one big flow & instead individual actions the agent is equipped with and can use together on it‚Äôs own. If so, very could. Hope to build something like it tomorrow And who checks the accuracy of the results, or the conflicting names, or the incorrect zip code, or the median, mean or modal pricing of the area, what other factors change such as Jon lives on a swamp, but saaid swamp is earmarked to be redeveloped into Disney's next Megga attraction? Again....still 'fluff'...Get off your ass and have a bloody good look at who your customers are... I think it can ingest data and summarize it in response to questions like a chatbot. ‚Äú¬†Functionally, Copilot could only really work as an assistant to a human agent/employee. Agentforce agents can be customer/externally facing and work nearly completely autonomously in addition to being able to assist employees.‚Äù is the latter roadmap or production? Agentforce (including Agentforce copilots) have been publicly available since late October ‚Äò24. Damn, if you‚Äôve got a white paper or use case on an external facing agent working nearly autonomously I‚Äôd love to see it. Feel free to pm if you‚Äôd prefer.

I think they are probably viewable on the Salesforce website or YouTube. But ultimately, if you‚Äôre familiar with the architecture of the Salesforce platform, understanding how Agentforce actually works is pretty simple. I think of it more as a very robust orchestration engine/planner service. The action autonomy comes from existing automations within systems the AI agent has access to, inside and outside of Salesforce. The reasoning and planning capabilities are what allow it to determine which actions (existing automations, processes, documents, code to call etc) to run under which circumstances. The result is pretty awesome, and has a lot of unexplored potentials, but the concept itself, at a high level, is pretty straightforward. Hope that helps. Got it. I think I better understand the scope of the product, thank you. that's a pretty fancy way to say it can ingest data and summarize it as a chatbot. Am I wrong? Yes, you are wrong, completely. Also, what I said in the comment you replied to literally doesn‚Äôt say anything indicative of anything you said. It can indeed ingest data and summarize it as a chatbot, as a side benefit. For the second time now- It can run code and flows, know when to run code and flows, in what order, on what basis, under which user‚Äôs level of permission across all metadata, use data (structured/unstructured) as a reference as a part of its evaluation on what plans of action to take, how to tailor its response based on those references, pass what it knows to be variables in said code/flows prior to running them, etc. It is, as I literally mentioned in the very comment you replied to, more akin to a planner service or an intelligent orchestration engine than to a chatbot. I‚Äôd love to see a chatbot do‚Ä¶ any of what I just said, without having to build an entire infrastructure of services around it to make those things happen. Edit: flows, clarification, a little snark :) It's a chatbot tied to source data. For example, the chatbot on the vans.com website. It can extract data in a source system and summarize it for you (product catalog) and then help you navigate the website and say, order a product, figure out how to return it if it sucks, etc. This is only agentic in the sense that in theory it is doing what a customer service agent would do. Except that such chatbots already existed. So it's a marginally better chatbot. What it can't do, that you probably expect it would, is to extract data from somewhere, come to a conclusion, and put it somewhere else. You know, like an actual travel agent might. Am I wrong? Again, sounds like 'fluff' a 'good' sales person should know their product....Their oppositions products, their nearest rivals products, the products about to be released on the market and any 'black ops' products in the wings....Try that with AI..FFS.. This is spot on. Everything else shown is roadmap. *generative chatbot, yes to rebranding, but you add in deterministic logic to pic an action via Atlas This is not really correct. Agent force is API to open AI to use various GPT models to help solve a lot of issues like call deflections from call centers. There are a ton of use cases. It is very powerful and easy if you leverage knowledge articles inside SF. The booths I‚Äôve asked about this get really antsy when I use the word ‚Äúrebranded‚Äù üòÇ ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs so much more! You‚Äôd do it a disservice to call it a copilot or rebranded‚Äù At least they covered it in their training isn't that Einstein prompt builder window built inside chat window ? FYI, It‚Äôs not rebranded. It‚Äôs a different backend tech. Supposedly better. Fairly sure the correct term is an Agent Assist tool. Sounds like a pretty poor excuse for a bloody sales person that should know their job.. Yes, but you're missing the key features that dramatically improve on copilot.  The Atlas Reasoning engine, natural language processing and access to data is what takes Agentforce to an entirely different level.  Agent's can now have full on conversations, understand context of the conversations and have the ability to act autonomously and take action.  Copilot was very limited in these capabilities.   The limitations with Agents is mainly data and what systems they're integrated with.  The limitations being what information they can access and provide as well as what actions can be taken.",

The result is pretty awesome, and has a lot of unexplored potentials, but the concept itself, at a high level, is pretty straightforward. Hope that helps. Got it. I think I better understand the scope of the product, thank you. that's a pretty fancy way to say it can ingest data and summarize it as a chatbot. Am I wrong? Yes, you are wrong, completely. Also, what I said in the comment you replied to literally doesn‚Äôt say anything indicative of anything you said. It can indeed ingest data and summarize it as a chatbot, as a side benefit. For the second time now- It can run code and flows, know when to run code and flows, in what order, on what basis, under which user‚Äôs level of permission across all metadata, use data (structured/unstructured) as a reference as a part of its evaluation on what plans of action to take, how to tailor its response based on those references, pass what it knows to be variables in said code/flows prior to running them, etc. It is, as I literally mentioned in the very comment you replied to, more akin to a planner service or an intelligent orchestration engine than to a chatbot. I‚Äôd love to see a chatbot do‚Ä¶ any of what I just said, without having to build an entire infrastructure of services around it to make those things happen. Edit: flows, clarification, a little snark :) It's a chatbot tied to source data. For example, the chatbot on the vans.com website. It can extract data in a source system and summarize it for you (product catalog) and then help you navigate the website and say, order a product, figure out how to return it if it sucks, etc. This is only agentic in the sense that in theory it is doing what a customer service agent would do. Except that such chatbots already existed. So it's a marginally better chatbot. What it can't do, that you probably expect it would, is to extract data from somewhere, come to a conclusion, and put it somewhere else. You know, like an actual travel agent might. Am I wrong?",

          "commentBody": "Yes, but you're missing the key features that dramatically improve on copilot.  The Atlas Reasoning engine, natural language processing and access to data is what takes Agentforce to an entirely different level.  Agent's can now have full on conversations, understand context of the conversations and have the ability to act autonomously and take action.  Copilot was very limited in these capabilities.   The limitations with Agents is mainly data and what systems they're integrated with.  The limitations being what information they can access and provide as well as what actions can be taken.",

      "commentBody": "Agentforce is the culmination of all the Einstein products, previously copilot, as the \"agents\" you create are generative. The agent builder is a very simplistic UI based in prompt engineering and natural language. The LLMs will make sense of natural language (chat mapping to topics and instructions) and the LAMs (large action model) is a deterministic engine that takes all the available data in the chat (plus knowledge, prompts, data Cloud or whatever it has access to) and makes a determination as to what action should be taken to best answer the question or problem. Agents can be created however is needed (sales coach, SDR, customer service, etc.) and in many ways can be a powerful L1 support model that can also hook into an Omni flow and send to a human should you need to go full Karen at the agent and demand a manager or an escalation agent meant to handle a Karen. You will also have the option to add in vector retrievers that can quickly pull in a search index of knowledge data or unstructed data to further augment the agent. The base builder has a very low barrier to entry as it's all natural language, when you get to the prompts to power you actions that can get more complex since you can augment via flows, apex, API and data Cloud -- but it's more up to you as to the information you'd need in that prompt to power through action the agent will take. Pretty good write up. I work on agent force. We have a ton of use cases internal whether be customer service, sales, even mechanics finding out how to solve a problem for a Lamborghini! Same :) Excuse my ignorance, but what does ‚Äúdeterministic ‚Äú mean in the context of the term you used (deterministic engine)? Thanks. For a visual representation, check out the keynote on YouTube where Atlas is mentioned, it's a different type of language model (LAM large action model). As that should give you the best idea of how it determines actions from the data it has access to, and if you see the agent UI the middle shows you engine running in real time. It's deterministic because it's not as cut and dry as an \"IF Then\" scenarios or legacy bots, it runs through all the topics, knowledge, and determines the proper action to take. So basically an advanced RPA framework? Ahh, so almost all the chat / call centre interactions I've had recently that p1ss me off are your fault? Thanks, what happened to helpful Sunjeep in Mumbai? Got replaced by a more useless AI?",

      "commentBody": "DF announcements never impact us immediately. They either are ideas that are not ready yet or a spin on existing features. Agentforce is spin on Copilot which was needed as the name was not unique to Salesforce and is also not generally available yet. Agentforce is a concept of a product, like Sales Cloud, but intended to be even bigger and span across all departments, hence not Agent Cloud, but Agentforce. The importance here is the potential focus of the company on making Agent operability the first consideration in all future features and its impact on future revenue to the company. The Agentforce builder uses the same screen design as Flow Builder. So imagine if every Flow was actually an Agent that automatically performed the right actions based on a conversation with a user instead of a user editing a record or clicking a button. A user could talk or type (maybe via Slack) to an Agent and say something like \"here's a copy of a signed contract Acme just sent over\" and the Opportunity would automatically get marked as Won and the attachment related to it, etc. You can imagine the time saved by not having to actually search for the record, click on it, click on Edit, make the change, click on Save, etc. Time saved means fewer employees needed. Add in automatic call/email summaries and maybe the user doesn't even need to chat with the Agent to make it happen. Then add in automated outbound emails and website Chatbots that react directly to the customer and we don't even need those expensive humans for half of our transactions. I don't work at Salesforce, so this is my personal opinion. They could just as easily pivot and say something else by TDX. I only made it to \"Agentforce is a concept of a product\" because I started rofl LOL Good jobs as this was close in some aspects but here's more deets. It's more a top experience later grounded by data, deterministic logic and topics/instructions set. The builder is the same builder from copilot, you just now see the topics, classification, scope and instructions + knowledgebase selection, not flow builder but you will use that as well depending on your specs. Yes, it is available in slack. And yes you can essentially invoke it from anywhere, keep in mind flows or apex can invoke prompts, so if you have a flow listening for threshold on an opportunity (opp > 1MM) then it can invoke your \"big opportunity\" agent that can guide a seller with commons questions/topics for opportunities of that size.",

Just like their CDP went from being called Salesforce CDP to Genie to Data Cloud in less than 18 months. Fair enough, Einstein Copilot sounded like something that has nothing to do with Salesforce, so probably a warranted change Needed a new costume for Astro to dress up in. Microsoft has copilot. Salesforce lost that one so Agentforce ,sounds more Salesforce like anyways. Some sessions they mentioned they had to edit their slides to say Agentforce. Funny thing is the main \"agent\" in the Setup, Agent Studio is still called Einstein Copilot. This is the Agent that is used when in Salesforce a user clicks the Einstein icon.",

We were quoted $50/user/month for co-pilot + prompt builder and this comes with caps on the volume of prompts. If we only want to take advantage of prompt builder (for triggered record summary, sentiment scores etc), then we could buy a single Einstein license for building these out and running the triggers. The volume based pricing was: 1,000 Einstein Requests = $2 What‚Äôs an Einstein Request you ask?  That‚Äôs the fun part. Every 1,500 words (sum of all words in outbound prompt + inbound response) = 10 Einstein Requests. But wait there‚Äôs more! There was no clear way to report on the usage of Einstein Requests in the org. When we did the math however, it was about 1/10 of the cost for a direct openAI 3.5 turbo integration ü´†",

They are selling dreams and blue kool-aid to customers, providers, and shareholders. Most of the real improvements are not as sexy but they matter most to day-to-day users and administrators. Wish they'd put this much money into fixing Salesforce support. I almost miss the days of Chatty and SaaSy. Anyway, good thing we no longer get backpacks and water bottles and you have to complete 27 tasks to get a weird plushie when before they would practically throw sweatshirts and external batteries and fans and socks and totes and slippers at you. Gotta just negatively impact the environment through AI instead! Brother you seem quite salty on Salesforce. Seen you complaining on multiple posts.  Maybe find a new path in life? lol Oops sorry I‚Äôm not guzzling the koolaid? I‚Äôm doing just fine actually. And way to assume I‚Äôm a dude. Maybe stop being a basic mediocre dude? lol You‚Äôre clearly disgruntled. You cry on every post.",

      "commentBody": "Omg I‚Äôm surprised by how low the community has gotten. ü§Ø Agentforce is simply AgenticAI. It‚Äôs an autonomous AI grounded by role and actions trained on. Example you can create an SDR Agent, Assign all leads that has an Einstein score of 50-80 (anything that you don‚Äôt want real people to waste time on) or whatever metric you need. Then train it on you Knowledge Base, give it some actions(like ability to generate Sales Email) and deploy it. It will then work on those leads as soon as they are created in the system. It can use generate email to send emails to these leads and answers any questions back. Until it‚Äôs ready to be passed over to real agents. https://research.aimultiple.com/agentic-ai/",
