    "postTitle": "Looking for feedback on a SF app (AI Salesforce Admin)",
    "postMessage": "I‚Äôve been working with Salesforce for awhile and noticed how much time/admin cost goes into configuration tasks (dashboards, workflows, migrations, etc.). I‚Äôm exploring an idea to automate parts of this process using AI by having users describe what they want in plain English, and having the system configure it in Salesforce. Before I build anything serious, I‚Äôd love to hear directly from people here: ‚Ä¢ Which admin/config tasks are the most repetitive/painful in your day-to-day?\n\n‚Ä¢ Are there tasks you think could never be automated? Open to any feedback at all including hearing ‚Äúthis is a terrible idea and here‚Äôs why.‚Äù üôè If you really like the idea I‚Äôll leave the landing page below so people can join the interest list. Would love to talk more and start building with some early users. Thanks in advance!!! https://getadmin.io",
