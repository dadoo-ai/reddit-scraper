      "commentBody": "Salesforce doesn’t natively show record date fields on a timeline most tools like Timewarp or AnyCalendar only handle related records. The usual workaround is either building a simple LWC to plot the record’s date fields on a timeline (using something like vis.js) or creating milestone records via Flow/Apex that mirror those dates and then displaying them in a timeline view.",

I’d love to just simply provide date field API names and have them placed on a Timewarp style component. \n\nThanks for the ideas though!",

I was hoping to display a record’a own date field values on a timeline. \n\nBasically I’m wanting to show various dates relevant to say a contract on a timeline component on that contract record. Start date, end date, expected RFP date, etc. it would just be a more attractive way to visualize dates then a bunch of them clumped in a field section.",

This automatically indexes the field, it's a little hacky but generally accepted as a solution. The alternative is that you can contact support to have them index the field in the backend through a skinny table or by marking the field as such independently. Unless your org is hundreds to thousands of users and you have a full dev ops pipeline, making the field external id is going to be the easiest, most controllable method. \n\nIf you have timeline (feature license version) you're doing better than most and can absolutely achieve this.",
