      "commentBody": "In terms of features, this may be acceptable, but the biggest concern is the lack of transparency around its pricing model. Although it’s known to follow a pay-as-you-use revenue model, the specifics are unclear, potentially leading to unexpected costs as it essentially functions like an open check. Extremely unclear. Especially with the three separate tiers and no actual documentation about what you're getting with each tier. This move to a credit consumption model may be great for Salesforce's bottom line, but it leaves a ton of ambiguity for clients who get blindsided by the bill. If AgentForce picks up like they say it will, at $2 a conversation, you could quickly rack up a huge bill. Yeah the consumption conversation model seems borderline insane. How would this be cheaper than an overseas call center? Cheaper? I don't think it would be... More effective at creating happy, satisfied customers? Probably orders of magnitude... Eh I think most people want to talk to real people if they're actually calling. So without any cost savings, I don't really get the upside for either side. Exactly! I firmly believe this feature should be included with the Service Cloud Unlimited license. Customers are already paying for the license, but then Salesforce comes in and says it’s an extra feature that requires an additional fee—and they won’t even disclose the cost upfront! I remember when my org bought unlimited and we were told it's the highest tier and includes everything... Then of course new product tiers come out above unlimited that include the newest features. What lack of transparency? It's list price $2 per conversation and the definition of a conversation is the exact same one as for the classic chat bot. Right now, you also need one license of Einstein and one for Digital Engagement, unless you're on UE. Then only Einstein. And as always there is room to negotiate....

      "commentBody": "Unless you’re a very large company with money to burn it’s never a good idea to be an early adopter of Salesforce products. They always come out underbaked and it also takes time for the consulting community to learn new products. I’d wait a year or two. Their products initially do not live up to the hype and will require more backend work, tweaking, customizing, trial and error, then what they promise.  If cost is a significant factor to your business. Do not be a first adopter. Wait for at least the 5th name change /s 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣 This isn’t really a first pass at the tech though.  It incorporates technology that has existed into a really satisfying culmination. Flow, chatbots, CDP now Data Cloud, metadata tags, generative AI. This is correct. I did a tutorial at the conference and it straight up did not work. Still got a tshirt though. I agree Couldn't agree more. Very well said. I'd wait three This mentality comes from a lot of partners and entities that have a pipeline built on products and features that are being retired or replaced. For example, the new Nonprofit Cloud was met with a lot of ire by those that had a big role in NPSP with sweeping claims that it was buggy, didn’t work, couldn’t do what it promised. While Salesforce was 100% transparent about their MVP and roadmap, two major releases later they’ve surpassed NPSP functionality. The products that have had rough launches are often acquisitions that take years to incorporate into the platform. This product specifically is tying together many existing, working features and adding a newish layer and quite frankly is a pretty solid product. By the time anyone is ready to fully implement it’ll be on the next release already. I specialize in npsp and npc and npc is no where near where npsp is at. The documentation is still terrible and about 75% of npsps features and automations are still not in npc. Yes npc theoretically has more it can do but it’s still hot garbage. That’s funny. 75%? That’s hyperbole at best. I’ve been implementing NPSP for seven years and have two full NPC implementations done and we’ve delivered a much more comprehensive and cleaner solution especially around program and case management. Fundraising is a far better schema than NPSP. Me consulting. Agentforce says what?",

          "commentBody": "This mentality comes from a lot of partners and entities that have a pipeline built on products and features that are being retired or replaced. For example, the new Nonprofit Cloud was met with a lot of ire by those that had a big role in NPSP with sweeping claims that it was buggy, didn’t work, couldn’t do what it promised. While Salesforce was 100% transparent about their MVP and roadmap, two major releases later they’ve surpassed NPSP functionality. The products that have had rough launches are often acquisitions that take years to incorporate into the platform. This product specifically is tying together many existing, working features and adding a newish layer and quite frankly is a pretty solid product. By the time anyone is ready to fully implement it’ll be on the next release already. I specialize in npsp and npc and npc is no where near where npsp is at. The documentation is still terrible and about 75% of npsps features and automations are still not in npc. Yes npc theoretically has more it can do but it’s still hot garbage. That’s funny. 75%? That’s hyperbole at best. I’ve been implementing NPSP for seven years and have two full NPC implementations done and we’ve delivered a much more comprehensive and cleaner solution especially around program and case management. Fundraising is a far better schema than NPSP.",

I went through the service cloud demo and I’m going through the marketing one later today. any initial thoughts on the product and does it do what they say it does? or its a lot of marketing fluff? It does do what they say. I’ve gotten an agent to work correctly as well as fail and the technology is surprisingly capable. Basically a zero percent error rate when selecting the right topic and action, at least for my use cases. There is also a massive roadmap on what is coming. I was at a partner training last week, where it was shown. Thus said, not everything is rolled out yet which should give you a good position for negotiation. I just got out of meeting with SFDC about the 'marketing' version of Agentforce.  They weren't prepared to show a real demo and the details that they gave didn't really impress me. It's purely inward facing to help your marketing team segment, build content, etc. I'm sure some orgs could use it, but there wasn't anything in there that made it innovative at all. Thanks for the feedback. The version that we are looking to implement is in customer service/call centers",

That’s right, with that example of changing to a bigger sweater size If you do the agent force trailhead, it will change your mind. It can’t handle any text but the exact text they tell you to say. Unlikely.  I’m in service and you can never underestimate the ability of the customer to not be able to articulate what they actually need. At the end of the day, agent force is just IF THEN statements - if the input is garbage, which customers are great at doing, the output will be garbage to them. This could deflect a lot of the more experienced customers - but honestly a good help or my account site will deflect them.  What you’re offering is a more personalized help / my account site search.  It’s still valuable - but not because you’re gonna get rid of contact centers or replace customer service. Also, Salesforce is kinda shifty in how they pitch it.  For the best stuff, you ALSO need to purchase Einstein - so it’s gonna be more expensive than agentforce alone.  There will be a lot of sticker shock. I kind of had the same thought. The demo looked cool but it was a very corporate friendly interaction. It didn't seem substantially different from automated systems today that I call. And it looked like you still have to setup up all the knowledge into topics and flows or apex. It wasn't like just plug into your existing knowledge base and it knows how to do things. All the cool AI tools I've played around with are either the direct to consumer browsers or SMB level apps. Once you have to do things inside of Salesforce, it seems like you kind of level down from what's currently on the market. 100% this. Also, so many people just cannot stand talking to a chat bot. And once they find out it's not a real person, they just start writing \"Agent,\" \"Live Person,\" \"Real Person,\" etc. Do you think this changes as generations shift? No, because everyone has had bad experience with AI bots totally misunderstanding what you are saying. You just need it to happen once to lose trust in it and wanting a human after. Millennial.  I at least try to self serve before dealing with a representative. If it works, great, if not, oh well, trust is not lost. But that’s just me. The mode of communication changes - but not that there’s a need for human to human customer service. To an individual agent it changes the calls that they need to assist on, at scale it could reduce headcount. If an agent gets through 60 calls a day, maybe they still get through 60 calls a day, but the total calls are reduced. But that’s not necessarily a good thing either.  Now instead of having a couple softballs to break up the day, every issue is a difficult issue to handle - otherwise the AI would have done it. My company thinks they can build it themselves using enterprise OpenAI license My company is looking into it. We have an in house AI that handles 40-50% of all customer questions. It is definitely the future.",

          "commentBody": "I kind of had the same thought. The demo looked cool but it was a very corporate friendly interaction. It didn't seem substantially different from automated systems today that I call. And it looked like you still have to setup up all the knowledge into topics and flows or apex. It wasn't like just plug into your existing knowledge base and it knows how to do things. All the cool AI tools I've played around with are either the direct to consumer browsers or SMB level apps. Once you have to do things inside of Salesforce, it seems like you kind of level down from what's currently on the market.",

      "commentBody": "Yes. It is. Is it ready for the big time? Probably not fully, but enough to realize some solid value if you get the right use cases. Is it cheap? Not really, but the prices always come down over time. Is it worth jumping into? Absolutely. I'm implementing it right now with a client of mine to handle their client portal support, and it's very good. I set up an agent in about 30 minutes, and it's able to raise cases through NLP. It chats with the client and determines what's wrong, creates a case, and sends it to the right people to address it. It's only going to get better - and if the Dreamforce keynote is right (and it usually is for this stuff), Salesforce is going all in on it. It's going to be one of the key areas of focus for development over the next 3-5 years. So, from a client perspective, yes, get in if it makes sense and is affordable. From a consultant perspective, overwhelmingly YES. This is going to be where the new deals come from. \"prices always come down over time\" - when has Salesforce ever lowered a price? Our AE has told us our licencing is going up 9% when our contract renews in Jan Well, I can tell you that Financial Services Cloud was costing $3500US a seat when it first came out. Mulesoft was frighteningly expensive. Vlocity was also incredibly expensive. Yes, there are yearly increases to existing contract holders, but if you look at early entrant costs versus late adopter costs, there's seismic differences in costing. We were an early adopter of FSC and our licence cost today is well below that despite going up each renewal (currently about 1/4 of the rate card price). Mulesoft and Vlocity were both acquisitions that they have created new pricing models for different market segments. Not sure I'd say it's cheaper, just more accessible outside large enterprise where the previous entry price points put it out of reach for smaller orgs. Especially given the huge investment they are making in Agentforce and Einstein, I cannot see them ever dropping the price unless the product isn't getting adoption. Let me add a flip side - I work at a mid-size SI - Mostly government contracts. I think the use case here is specifically and only support at this time making it a very expensive agent. Now, this is certainly more than just a chatbot and can be really powerful. But the use case for this at this point in the game is highly complex support trees where you really want to get to the root of the issue as much up front as possible. And for it to be a good experience. There are so many different options these days for chatbots that work for most midsize companies or agencies. I am struggling to sell this as a benefit to my customers personally, given their demographics.",

It seems like some of the backend engine and builder UI is built on top of their copilot solution from last year which has been through a lot of iteration and improvement, so it’s not truly “new”.",

AI as we know it nowadays is built with implicit biases that stem out of what the tool’s use-case was originally for. I’m a firm believer in using heavy caution with things like this, especially because AI is still relatively new. My concern is that AI might let some of the core things that end-users need to focus on slip through the cracks. Companies that do a lot of sales may end up having some sales that may end up being crucial sales in the future (i.e., one small client ends up influencing more clients to buy the supplier’s products) fall through the cracks. It’s probably not the answer that any of y’all were looking for, but I’m against the use of AI, including Agentforce and Einstein AI and even ChatGPT/OpenAI, until there are regulations in place for it (notably additional GDPR and EU regulations)",

I say its legit now because of the advancements in the AI models like OpenAI GPT 4 (my favorite, you can select others).  A few years back this was all vaporware for Salesforce. Salesforce has done a good job of incorporating AI by adding the trust layer where they never send customer data to the models.  Einstein AI can run/use Flows and Apex. I created a prompt to summarize case and included apex to get all emails and posts and it did a much better job then the standard Summarize Case. A big time saver for anyone looking at a big long case for the first time. Their KB article recommendation is great with Service AI. It created an internal model based on all our kb articles and it's much more accurate than the current free KB suggested articles. Salesforce keeps adding more features which is nice. We started with about 6 standard actions and now there are 14 for Service AI. No notifications these were added. Of course all of this takes time to setup. The most I've learned is writing detailed AI prompts. I hear this is going to be an in demand profession so a nice to have.",
