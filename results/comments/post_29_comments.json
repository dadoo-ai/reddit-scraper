Strikes me as a sensable move knowing admins need to approve and install OAuth connected apps moving forward anyway?. Do we see the ecosystem erroring on side of caution and favoring installed managed packages over connected apps?  I am also curious if folks are taking a hard look at Chrome extensions too? There are a number of widely adopted connected apps: Telephony, communications, data/analytics, and other productivity apps designed for end-users. Thanks for the insights and advice.",

I had to read it 3 times to reach your conclusion, but your assessment is also my understanding... \n\nOnly part I am confused:\n\nThe \"Uninstalled Connected App\" is something I still don't fully understand.. OAuth-connected apps are technically not \"Installed\", but you can click \"Install\" as a Salesforce admin. So does that mean someone will authenticate but then get blocked until an Admin goes and clicks \"Install\" moving forward? Will this new setting completely bl?ock the app from showing up as OAuth authenticated? Are apps considered \"Uninstalled\" even if someone has not clicked \"Uninstall\"? \n\nForgetting random apps floating on the internet... Tableau Online, Google Sheets, and Workbench, to name a few, are widely adopted. Just curious what the new process is to enable these.  \n  \nI am curious what governance and management of these OAuth-connected apps looks like moving forward?.",

              "commentBody": "\"Uninstalled\" could mean either:  \n\\- The app was installed and then later uninstalled  \n\\- The app has not yet been installed\n\nSo this begs the question...how does the app get installed to begin with? There are 3 main ways:  \n1. It was created directly in your org  \n2. It was deployed to your org directly via a package  \n3. It was first authorized by a user and then manually installed by an admin from the Setup menu.\n\nThe advantage to an \"installed\" connected app versus one that's merely been \"authorized\" is that it provides options to admins to manage specific policies, such as IP restrictions and refresh token expirations.\n\nPreviously, basically any API enabled user could authorize a connected app. This could be a big security risk since the connected app will be able to make API calls to the org and access any data that the user that authorized it can view.\n\nGoing forward, to authorize a new connected app the user will need specific permissions:  \n\\- If **API Access Control** is enabled in your org, then the user must have the \"**Use Any API Client**\" permission.  \n\\- If **API Access Control** is \\*not\\* enabled in your org, then the user must have either the \"**Use Any API Client**\" permission or the \"**Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps**\"\n\nSalesforce is trying to plug this hole in the least disruptive way possible. That's why connections for previously authorized connected apps, even if they are not yet installed to the org, will continue to work. The one exception to this is if that connected app supports the device OAuth flow then the current authorization will be invalidated. Admittedly you have to do some technical gymnastics to determine if a given connected app supports the device OAuth flow--if anyone wants to see how it's done feel free to shoot me a message.\n\nI think maybe some example scenarios could also help explain the situation:\n\nImagine when you go to \"**Connected Apps OAuth Usage**\" from Setup in your Salesforce org you see the following apps listed:\n\n\\- Trailblazer.me  \n\\- Salesforce CLI  \n\\- My Connected App\n\nScanning to the right, you see that the Trailblazer.me app has a button offering admins to \"Install\" the connected app, while the Salesforce CLI has a button offering to \"Uninstall\" You also see a hyperlink for \"Manage App Policies\" for both Salesforce CLI and My Connected App. There is a \"Block\" button by My Connected App, but no option to either install or uninstall.\n\n\\- Trailblazer.me - this connected app has been authorized but not installed.  \n\\- Salesforce CLI - this connected app was authorized AND installed; that's why you can manage its app policies and also choose to uninstall it.  \n\\- My Connected App - this connected app was authorized and installed by default b/c it was created within the org, that's why there's no option to uninstall it.\n\nToday, basically any API Enabled user could go to the Workbench site and run through the OAuth approval flow. Then suddenly Workbench would also appear on that same page.\n\nGoing forward, only a user with one of the user permissions mentioned above would be able to authorize Workbench. Afterward, an admin could officially 'install' the Workbench connected app and then others within the organization would be able to authorize it as well.",

At the individual level, they appear in the 'OAuth Apps' section of 'Advanced User Details' and at the organization level they appear within the 'Connected Apps OAuth Usage' section of Setup. While authorized, they may not be fully \"installed\" or managed directly within the Salesforce setup.\n2. **Installed Connected Applications**: These are applications that have been formally installed into the Salesforce org, either via a managed package, by creating a Connected App directly in the org, or through manual installation from the 'Connected Apps OAuth Usage' section in Setup. These applications are typically managed by administrators and have broader access and configuration options within the org's setup.",

          "commentBody": "Thanks for the good summary.\n\nWe recently turned on API Access Control so are ahead of the curve for this. However, there was a scenario that was interesting - we have an integration with Unbounce, a web form platform. It didn't appear in 'Connected Apps OAuth Usage' so we missed it when we were doing the work to the API control on. It was only spotted when reported by users as not working; sure enough, on the integration user's login history you could see the connection being tried and blocked (as expected, because it hadn't been installed + had not been added to a permission set + assigned to the user).  \n  \nSo we tried to re-authenticate the connection. It still didn't appear. For clarity the integration is made by connecting to Salesforce from the Unbounce platform UI, by entering a username, password, and MFA if enabled. It shows in the integration user's login history as type 'Remote Access 2.0' and subtype of 'OAuth Refresh Token'.\n\nI raised a ticket with SF. They said (I've omitted the actual IDs and replaced with XXXXXs):\n\n\"I've further checked on this Connected App usage by reviewing the internal logs and found that your external application is using the Client Credentials from another Org to authenticate to this org: XXXXX\n\nAs the OAuth allows to access multiple orgs using the client credentials as mentioned here: [https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2011/07/quick-tip-using-oauth-across-multiple-orgs](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2011/07/quick-tip-using-oauth-across-multiple-orgs)  \n  \nFrom our logs, I found that the Connected App ID is XXXXX and it is created in the Org: XXXXX.  \n  \nHowever, this org:XXXXX isn't available now, which could be either it is deleted or refreshed.  \n  \nSince this org is no longer present, you're unable to view this Connected App in the OAuth Usage/App Manager. So, it is recommended to create the new connected app in production and have your external application use the updated Client credentials.\"\n\nI further queried with support to confirm - they said that Unbounce would need to make this change. This sounds like Unbounce have done something odd here when creating the integration? Have you come across this sort of thing before? Is there any way around it other than, a) not using the integration, or b) giving the integration user the 'Use any API...' permission?",

              "commentBody": "Ouch that article is poorly written. It sounds like you first created the connection to your sandbox &amp; that your old sandbox was refreshed so it no longer exist. So you should be able to Remove all OAuth connections that still exist in your salesforce &amp; any sandboxes. Next go to  Unbounce platform to reconnect to your salesforce production. If that doesn't work then tell Unbounce to break the connection so it can be reset. I've had some experience with Oauth for Novo Ed apps, where the sandbox Oauth lasted 24 hours so we often had to break or remove the dead connection &amp; sometimes get them to reset it or something. All OAuths only last about 24 hours but are usually kept open longer by pings. When they break/disconnect after 24 hour they can be a real pain to reconnect. If you want more help then dm me.\n\nEDIT: It also possible that it never worked on production. As we once had sandbox refresh result in a bunch of dead content links on a community. Turns out the link all had sandbox in the URL, so the content was never moved to production. Therefor, if you recently refresh the sandbox &amp; the user just created new form Unbounce to the old sandbox &amp; got a connection error, well then they may have never actually tried to enter record &amp; see if that record actually went to production. Some people just don't fully test from end to end for every change.",
