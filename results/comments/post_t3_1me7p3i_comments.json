    "postMessage": "We're evaluating Agentforce 3 as part of our Salesforce setup and curious how it's performing in real environments. The pitch sounds promising. AI agents that act like smart sales reps, better user intent recognition, faster follow-ups, etc. But is it actually delivering on those promises? Does it really understand customer intent better than traditional tools? Any noticeable improvements in lead quality, conversion, or agent efficiency? Or is it just more automation with a fancy label? Would love to hear from anyone who’s implemented it. Especially curious about challenges during setup or integration with other Salesforce tools. Thanks in advance!",
