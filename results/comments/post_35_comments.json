    "postMessage": "As a long time admin-architect whose code supervisor of many years has been pulled into another project, leaving me as the sole enterprise system owner, I have both the burden and the freedom to begin questioning some of the rolling-legacy code quality that has left us with frequent integration failures due to apex time outs. While I'm great at communicating and designing complicated business solutions, CPQ capabilities, huge Flows etc I am NOT nor ever wished to be a capable Apex coder. So I quickly glommed onto Claude to develop ideas in an evening that a dev would have kept me waiting weeks for (ask how I know) - and yes, fully class tested and working! After succeeding in two smaller challenges, I went straight to our big dog global Account Team automator, which ChatGPT describes well, \"it was a god class: it handled state control, SOQL queries, reassignment logic, and DML all inside one block. That made it inefficient, harder to test, and difficult to extend.\" What it offered was to split the single class into 6, with < 5,000 total characters. But this was only after I already brought the challenge to Claude who had the same conclusion - BUT it gave me 26 classes and > 55,000 characters!! I have to wait a day to refresh the latest QA box into two unique sandboxes to test these side-by-side, but I gave ChatGPT the solution from Claude stating my unease, and it happily assured me that they perform all the same tasks and even broke out a side-by-side comparison of every class. Anyway, I found this pretty fascinating and if OpenAI really can do the job in 1/10 the space, it adds up to a significant code base delta...",

Once I got that far, i used Claude to digest my existing metadata, BRD and Functional Spec.  \n\n\nI gave Claude a simple instruction to hypothesize 2-3 different approaches, and a last “Best Practice for Minimal Tech Debt”.  Took my favorite ideas from all of them, used VS code and SF plugins to identify improvements. \n\n\nA competent SF developer would probably have done much cleaner and faster, likely with less future headaches— but unlike them, I’ve been cowboying  BRD’s into PRD with excellent documentation for a decade.  \n\n\n\nI probably saved 2 weeks of waiting and 4 hours of meetings.",
