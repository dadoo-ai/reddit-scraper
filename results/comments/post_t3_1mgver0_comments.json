    "postMessage": "Anybody accomplished this? I have been trying to create an agent with the Topic General FAQ and the action answer questions with knowledge throught data studio, whithout success. I have checked the data library, data stream, search index, permissions to the knowledge object and categories from the einstein user, access to the knowledge articles and all seems to be correct. If I configure a data libreary with a pdf file, It works fine, but with data cloud dont work (but obviously the idea is to have the knowledge in realtime with the last updates) Any suggestion? Or any tutorial that actually work? Thanks in advance. I dont know if i need to create a ticket with salesforce because even we had some meeting with an 'expert' and was also not able to configure it correctly. Edit:  Thank you u/TresselsSweaterVest !!! The problem was in the promp template, had to update the appropriate custom retriever!!!!",

I have the same use case and I found it pretty straightforward but I wasn't using default anything. You should start with Prompt Builder and use the \"flex\" template. In the prompt resources you should be able to select your Retriever if it's set up correctly. After that, you set up the Action and Topic. Thank you! I'll try this!",
