    "postTitle": "Configuring Agentforce SDR agent",
    "postMessage": "I am trying to configure an SDR agent in a SDO org. i have followed the steps listed out- basically from the Agentforce SDR setup. even after enabling all prerequisite it says \"You don't have the required permissions for one or more setup steps. Ask your Salesforce admin for permission.\" at the top of the setup page. Further, I have configured the agent but i don't see any chatwindow like it shows up in case of copilot. Is it not expected for SDR? Also when i try to create a lead under the activities it shows the outreach email but it gives a message saying \"SDR Agent cannot send scheduled emails\" . I have given the automated actions and agentforce SDR agent perm sets to the agent user. Is there anything i am missing.",

      "commentBody": "The message on the top, you can ignore. (Told by a product manager from SF) I don’t think there will be any chat window. Because the agent is supposed to send an email once you activate the agent on a lead page You are getting that message, mostly because EAC is not working. Were you able to change the email address on your user setting and match it with the email address of the account you have connected for EAC? I received an org from the world tour event but I cannot change email address on it(of course because the default email address the org came with, I don’t have access to it). So when I connect my Gmail account to EAC, it doesn’t work because my Gmail account email address doesn’t match with the email address on my user page. Thanks for the reply. I kept the same email id for myself and the agent but still see same error coming. Did you check the email deliverability set to all emails? https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.data_sandbox_email_deliverability.htm&type=5 Yes it is already set to \"All Emails\". So just to add on the EAC setting, I have selected Google G-suite (user mode). Both mine and agent's email addresses are \"gmail\" addresses now. I also tried with keeping both emails non-gmail (my corporate domain). EAC is new for me hence wanted to call out the steps in case i may be doing it incorrectly.",
