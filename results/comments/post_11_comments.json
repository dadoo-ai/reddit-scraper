    "postMessage": "A package is being developed in a DE org. I personally deployed code and retrieved it using package.xml file in manifest folder. Also the \"standard\" Org Browser in VS Code worked fine. Now another person worked on this org writing Unit Tests. After that I can;t retrieve code via VS Code. It gives me the error I've never seen before: Starting SFDX: Retrieve This Source from Org\n\nNo components retrieved\n\nThis org does not have source tracking. What is going on here? EDIT: Here is the issue - github.com/forcedotcom/cli/issues/3376 Just install previous version (64.10.1) of \"Salesforce CLI Integration\" extension and it will start working again.",

I updated my Salesforce CLI to the latest version which caused the issue.\n\nIf you have the manifest (package.xml) open you can use the Command Palette (CTRL+Shift+P) to run the Retrieve Source command.   That works fine.   It is only when you try to right click that you have an error.\n\nI found that command line instructions on the terminal also work.  \n\nHopefully this is patched quickly.",
