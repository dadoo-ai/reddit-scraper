    "postMessage": "I am a Salesforce Developer with 2.6 years of experience. Lately, I’ve been thinking about my future because I feel like I’m dependent on a single platform. I know Salesforce is one of the most widely used CRMs, but at some point, won’t it become saturated?As a Salesforce Developer, what should I do to ensure a stable career? Should I continue in the Salesforce ecosystem, or is it better to switch to another technology?",

Rather than fixate on a specific skillset, it seems like ensuring you're the cream of the crop at whatever you do is the more sensible play.",

As you say if we are good at what we do it will show, but be prepared to have to explain it slowly to recruiters on occasion.",

My advice, keep building skills beyond just Salesforce, like core programming, integrations, or cloud platforms, so you’re not tied to a single tool. You don’t need to switch completely, but diversifying your skills will give you more stability and flexibility down the line.",

If you are a dev knowing more platforms more languages which are related and useful together is your best bet, spicing it with more and more architecture knowledge. \nIf you are an admin, learning more AI configuration, more related systems to configure like additional ERP, understand product and pricing system and be able to use prompt to generate code, explore platform maintenance skills (LDV, multi org setup, experience cloud). The key is to stay relevant and always improve. Yearly test yourself in the job market - if you are an easy sell - you are on track :)",

If you are a Salesforce Architect that can code and know the Oil &amp; Gas space very well, you not have a hard time finding a job. Do you know how few people can do that (well) in the industry?\n\n2. Ride the trends. **There will always be a new trend in technology**...especially in this industry. It's AI now. 10-15 years ago it was big data. A few years ago it was [NFT Cloud](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-announces-web3-a-rebrand-of-the-nft-cloud/). This path is not for the weak of heart. You have to reinvent yourself every few years. But it has worked for folks.",

With a couple of years’ experience, you can start branching into the higher-value areas like architecture, integrations or industry-specific clouds instead of just staying in one lane.\n\nAnd, the key isn’t really “should I quit Salesforce,” it’s more like “how do I make my skills future-proof?” Learn things that go beyond just the platform, stuff like APIs and integrations, cloud basics on AWS or Azure, security and design patterns, and honestly the consulting side of it too. Those skills transfer anywhere.\n\nSalesforce demand isn’t going away anytime soon, so you don’t have to jump ship, but if you keep adding those broader skills, you won’t feel stuck or at risk if the tech landscape shifts later.",

Continue with diversification and stay in Salesforce’s ecosystem but add cross platform skills like JavaScript and SQL.\n\nFrequent acquisitions by Salesforce is also great trend for a tech and as a skill.\n\nAs a young developer I would suggest you to adopt a hybrid approach by combining Salesforce expertise with broader tech skills to protect against market saturation and layoffs, and avoid limiting yourself to Salesforce alone.

At some point, the very nature of the platform might even make the role of devs and admins obsolete (just a guess). On the other hand, if the focus is on how to design a good sales/service process, the longevity should be greater.",
