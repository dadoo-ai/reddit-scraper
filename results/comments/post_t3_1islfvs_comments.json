      "commentBody": "Just cleared the Agentforce Specialist exam and super happy with the score! I mainly prepared using Skillcertpro, and honestly, it was a total lifesaver. About 80% of the questions in the actual exam were straight from their practice sets, including quite a few tricky, scenario-based ones. Their Master Sheet was perfect for last-minute revision – helped me quickly brush up on important stuff the night before. Most of the exam focused on prompt engineering, AI agent setup, grounding methods, integration with Data Cloud, and Sales/Service Cloud use cases. If you're planning to give this exam, Skillcertpro is totally worth it – saves a lot of time and gives you real exam-like practice.

Honestly kinda pissed, I will have to reschedule to acomodate the changes midway through my studies. Why not just release a new  certification focused only on agent force blows my mind, stupid idea.

So doesn’t matter if you sit it before the name change, it will catch up with you later. \n“What if I Already Have the AI Specialist Credential? If you have already earned your AI Specialist credential, you do not need to take the Agentforce Specialist version, Salesforce says. Your AI Specialist credential will be updated to Agentforce Specialist on March 3, 2025, and you will get an email with more information about the change along with details on how to download your new certified logo.” https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-changes-ai-specialist-exam-to-certified-agentforce-specialist",

Can someone please help me I highly recommend the Udemy course \"Agenforce Practice Exam Questions\". I struggle getting to 72% :-( You recommend this course, did it help you pass? Udemy course (or Valid Exam Dumps - probably better as it has more questions) https://www.udemy.com/course/salesforce-certified-ai-specialist-exam-real-exam-questions/learn/quiz/6872045/test#overview PS: I abandoned the Agentforce ship :-( I don't think AF has a chance in the market compared to e.g., Kore AI. But that's my personal opinion, of course. Good luck!",
