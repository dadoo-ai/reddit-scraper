I am using custom lightning types to get some input from user to the agent. You can define variables in the agent, I would imagine you can get/set in the lwc however I’ve not done it myself I have tried both context variables and custom variables but i am not getting their value in the lwc. Also, i think this variables are for different purpose. my take: We can use this variables in the action detail page, we can assign this variables to a particular input, so agent wont ask details for that parameter and use the data stored in the variable as input. i had tried to use the 'Assign a Variable' input box in an action details page and assigned an context variable there and now the agent wont even show the lwc because it just takes the data from the assigned variable.",

We had two screen flows on a page and we used the Lightning Messenger Service to pass data on the client side. When one flow changed a value the other flow,. using the LMs was refreshed. I wonder if you could use the LMS to pass data from the agent to your LWC? Alternatively maybe a Platform Event?",
