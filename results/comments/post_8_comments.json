    "postMessage": "I’ve been working in salesforce for the last 4 years, and I’ve found it difficult to get a job these days. I think I need to have options, how can my salesforce skills be useful in another role? As a sf developer I’ve mostly used apex, done some lightning web components, I’ve never done complex (or simple) integrations though. And I’ve done lots of the admin configurations (rules, flows, permissions). The first thing that comes to mind is frontend, but I really wish there are more options for me. So please, I need some guidance or just your opinions edit: some spacing",

I think most of SF developers I know are too focused on SF and start to forget the fundamental CS work. Vice versa, I have worked with Tech Leads who has 20-30 years of experience and not only they know Salesforce, but also other tech stack too. \n\nWhen you start to care more about understanding business flows and deliverables, coding is just a small part.",

I say almost because it is possible if you’re willing to reset to an entry level developer and in effect restart your career.",

      "commentBody": "Salesforce development is not a transferable skillset to general software engineering. Not in the slightest. The Salesforce platform is a very, very bad development platform. Apex and LWCs are low quality, sandboxed, outdated, and most of what you learn is specific to the limitations of the Salesforce platform, not general software engineering. You will not be able to pass an entry level developer interview if you have only worked on the Salesforce platform. Instead, you need to start getting real world software development experience, either through classes, self directed learning, side projects, or all three.",
