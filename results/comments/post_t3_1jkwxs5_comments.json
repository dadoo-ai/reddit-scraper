    "postTitle": "Agentforce can't receive files or read then?",
    "postMessage": "I have a scenario where a company that sells products in its stores wants to respond to users when they send a picture of a product. Example:\nA user sends a picture of an Air Jordan. The agent receives the image and responds: \"Cool, we have this sneaker in our store, the Air Jordan. Here’s our phone number, etc.\" What I tried: I created a Prompt Template Flex with GPT-4, but the field only accepts text. It works only if users send a URL, not an uploaded file. My question: Can I process both URLs and uploaded image files?",

      "commentBody": "Agentforce does not support direct image uploads; it only accepts image URLs. One solution is to have users upload their images to a cloud service (such as an S3 bucket or Imgur) and share the link. Your agent can then process the image URL as needed. Yeah. Or do that part custom on your custom app. Upload the image and send the link. Thanks, I found it in a presentation of theirs here... They say that GA is in April, I highly doubt it. An agent with only text in 2025 is crazy. Commercially available agentic solutions are like 6 months old…",
