    "postTitle": "Does anyone use Salesforce for project management?",
    "postMessage": "If so, what is your company size and industry if you don’t mind sharing. How complex is the project workflow? My organization currently uses spreadsheets, though via a SaaS tool called Airtable as a lot of the team does not have an excel background and it is slightly more intuitive. I view it as an unnecessary expense. We already use SF as our CRM and have been looking to consolidate applications overall. We’ve developed workflows within it that covers everything from assignment, tracking, document storage, etc. so it appears to be the case, but I am not a SF expert. For reference the organization I work for is a professional services firm with a little under 100 employees and three technical staff including a dedicated SF administrator. I am seeing it is possible and has been done, though it seems to be the case with organizations much larger than mine. Is SF a viable project management solution? Are there downsides to adding the workflow directly to SF? My biggest concerns are viability, scalability and cost. If it helps, most of the team already has Salesforce licenses, which is the biggest cost we are currently foreseeing outside of development.",

      "commentBody": "Yes, Salesforce can work well for project management, especially since your team already has licenses. The big benefits are a single source of truth, CRM integration, and customizable workflows. The trade-off is that it’s not a dedicated PM tool, so you’ll need some configuration or dev work, and overly complex setups can get heavy. For a 100-person services firm, it’s definitely viable if you keep the design simple.",

      "commentBody": "Yeah, Salesforce can definitely work for project management, especially if your team already lives in it for their daily work. One option to check out is PMT Plus (full disclosure: that’s my AppExchange app). It adds things like task assignments, Gantt charts, RAID logs, and templates without having to build it all custom.\n\nWhere it really shines is repeatable projects like client onboardings — those follow the same steps every time, so we use PMT templates + Flow Orchestrations to automate a ton of the work (assignments, reminders, sequencing). That saves a ton of manual admin time and keeps everything consistent.\n\nBig benefits:\n    •    Your team is already in Salesforce → adoption is way easier.\n    •    Everything ties back to Accounts/Opportunities, so Sales + Service stay aligned.\n    •    You don’t need another tool like Airtable (keeps cost/complexity down).\n    •    Works great for professional services teams since most projects are either onboardings or repeatable processes.\n\nAt the end of the day, PM is about 3 things: knowing what needs to be done, consolidating across projects for resource planning, and communicating to stakeholders. That’s exactly what we designed PMT Plus to cover inside Salesforce.\n\nIf your projects are just checklists, Salesforce may feel like overkill. But if you’re running repeatable service projects, it’s a great fit.\n\nShameless plug link - [Workbridge PMT Plus](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=21363397-4d30-4bcc-82c7-6d2280005c7b)",

      "commentBody": "Hmmm\n\nBy default it is not a PM tool.\n\nThere are add ons you could explore.\n\nThere are ways to customize it, but it depends how complex your PM processes are.\n\nIf you need project and task level tracking, with dependency, resource assignment, time tracking, slack analysis, Gantt and other visualization.... you're better off buying a paid tool.\n\nIf your team is frustrated with Airtable, wants to explore moving PM into Salesforce, I would be happy to have a preliminary discussion to give some guidance.\n\nTypically, I would always recommend having clear buy in internally for making a change. Documenting the processes that the PM tool would need to facilitate. Then going to market to see how much off the shelf tools would cost while exploring if customizing the system declaratively or programmatically would cost to facilitate the processes.\n\nThe first is usually cheaper up front with lifelong costs, while the second is usually more expensive up front but still has ongoing costs.\n\nIf the main missions is to save money by leaving aurtable, I don't believe there is an attractive ROI conversation to be had. unless I'm underestimating the cost of airtable.",
