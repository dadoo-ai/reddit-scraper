      "commentBody": "I've seen so many buzzwords and koolaid throughout the years in the SF ecosystem. This is just the sabor of the month. I remember seeing a demo of Google Glass for support agents at Dreamforce a few years ago. Chatter was supposed to be the next revolution. Einstein is already on its way out. That's all koolaid for investors. Yeah makes you think if its worth it to spend your precious time in learning this when most of the companies won't even touch it. That's what I'm thinking. Maybe I'm stuck in the past, and the technology will pass me by. But I don't really pay attention to AgentForce. Like it or not, most of the users are struggling with badic CRM stuff, like creating reports and automations. There's enough business there for me. Benioff was on Motley Fool Money last week selling it: https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/2025-03-08-marc-benioff-on-agentic-ai-and-next/ I'm a recognized leader in the space of software delivery. I have no idea what he was talking about. More seriously: He didn't actually say anything. Listen to the audio; AgentForce is \"deeply embedded\" and \"truly integrated\" across \"all salesforce products in the entire enterprise\" so you can \"just turn it on.\" Yet he really only gives one use case: A Chatbot for customer service. AND the way he explains the chatbot is this totally weird sales-y way about having a wide shoe or something. The /only/ real evidence he gives is that the link appears on global nav on the vans shoes website. That's like ... it. The clear implication is that the customer service bot will actually do things like look up your orders an cancel them or refund your money etc with you typing in english and being logged in ... but he chooses his words carefully so it could just be chatGPT hooked up to the customer service scripts. We really don't know. Does anyone know? Seriously what are some use cases for AgentForce that work? This looks promising https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/use-cases/ But I really don't know if the tool can live up to its promise. How is Einstein on its way out? Do you think that autonomous agents in general are where the industry is going? Whether you think Agentforce is \"good\" or not, I find it hard to believe that the premise in general will not transform business. Comparing GenAI tools to Google Glass or Chatter really isn't the right comparison in my mind. You didn't have millions of people trying Google Glass in the first few weeks of its release like ChatGPT. Edited: hard to believe it will NOT transform business. Oops! Honestly what ever AI they use it will always be called Einstein something.  Einstein will never die. The funny thing is... because they keep using that name for everything,  Einstein will never be able to answer questions about Einstein well. Einstein will die whenever they lose the appetite to pay the license for the name. Love the conversation here - I was a google glass explorer and saw very early that the human face/eyes are not going to be the future - what virtual glasses in all the various forms are and will become - are industry specific capabilities - healthcare/medical, leaerner/training, manufacturing workers - but 8 billion people on the planet with glasseses of some kind covering their face or even meta raybans - we all just won't accept the intrusion.   Agentforce is very much real - and it is not going away. It is not google glass, nor chatter, nor einstein - Einstein was/is simply machine learning.   White paper \"Attention is all you need\" changed everything and made way for Chat GPT and now the market landscape of Agentic AI - this is different (FOR SURE!)",

      "commentBody": "I've implemented it for a customer and I have a few thoughts on it. It's a powerful tool and works well from my experience. It requires that you direct it to the right tables for the actions to work well. Prompts have to be good and the instructions to the agent need to be clear. The push is two fold, firstly Salesforce want to get it out there to stress test the tool (all those companies that went \"live\" before Jan 31 are essentially beta testers). Secondly, companies want to be seen as pioneers in their industries by embracing AI. Personally, I think the majority of companies that went live with it won't have their agents on in 6 months (I know two companies that have turned theirs off already) because there will be difficulty in managing the ROI. In addition, many companies didn't do a proper analysis on where an agent was most effective. In my view, it's a good tool that will get better. Get well versed in it because SF will be looking for partners that can accelerate deployment which equals more ACV. A lot of the problems people are trying to solve are really data quality and knowledge management issues. Agentforce won't magically fix that. No AI will in the short term, and you wouldn't want it to. A lot of the value in Agentforce will be unlocked when the major capabilities get pushed down to the end user level. Right now, despite \"clicks not code\" virtually everything requires an IT team with knowledge across multiple domains. Yes, we can build that agent...if you give me the following roles: Salesforce Admin, Slack Admin, Data Cloud Admin, a data architect that understands where you keep everything and what it means, somebody with fantastic process automation skills, a prompt engineer, a software developer with Apex experience, a UX designer (if you want to surface it anywhere but Slack), etc, etc, etc. Let's not get started with how hard it is to actually *deploy* an agent in a corporate environment, or get it access to the data it needs (even if the end user has access through normal channels). Oh, you just want an FAQ bot? Sure. Where do you store your knowledge? Who keeps it up to date? How is AI going to figure out what is relevant (don't tell me you're just going to \"RAG it in\"). Most of the time you don't need AI, you just need a well-designed and maintained knowledge management system. Exactly right. It's all data driven. Even though AF supposedly works well with \"unstructured data\" it still needs to be massaged into a form that is actionable. So not really unstructured. I'm curious to see where we are in a year. I have optimism about it but I think the product will be pushed forward more by the community than salesforce themselves. This! A thousand times this. Hey I really hope you might be able to help here. I am working on an gent for a company website ( in app and web channel), but unable to get the flow showing up in the agent's connections page? the flow  has the agent selected, flow is activated etc.. any thoughts please? <image> https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=service.miaw_prepare_org_1.htm&type=5 Brooooo/Brahhhhh there are so many bugs Engagement rules not showing up on the Ui after you saved them. But I know they exist because they are getting triggered correctly. If you have a prompt and activate it but click on the prompt from the agent action it will show up blank. It honestly infuriates me because as a consultant we are selling agentforce for salesforce and then because of these bugs and poor help center articles, I’m just waisting time building the plane as we go with the customer breathing down my neck I honestly think that's a bug. The same thing happened on mine as well but it still worked as expected. Thanks, one more to the list of   many bugs around agentforce i guess... might as well raise it with SF support then. Yeah raise it with them. I did as well back in Jan. Even I have faced the same Apparently its a known issue:- https://issues.salesforce.com/issue/a028c000010F2cfAAC/~ Only three reports.  Do we have all the affected users in this thread? 😂 Are you trying to create an action like a lookup, or record update? If so go to setup, actions and create the action. You can then add that action to your topic. If you're trying to setup ASA and route escalations to a human there is some other setup that needs to be done outside of Agentforce. Look Within the messaging tab in setup and take a look at your routing setup for the channel. You should be able to  select your omni flow and that should populate it under the agent. Also make sure you select your agentforce service agent and not just agent in the flow. I made that mistake and it was routing to an actual agent not my service agent. -Salesforce SE",

If you have a prompt and activate it but click on the prompt from the agent action it will show up blank. It honestly infuriates me because as a consultant we are selling agentforce for salesforce and then because of these bugs and poor help center articles, I’m just waisting time building the plane as we go with the customer breathing down my neck",

      "commentBody": "My prediction: having humans on your first line of support will be a selling point companies use to stand out soon. Talking to a person provides a better experience AND provides the opportunity to leave a better impression on your customer than a chatbot EVER will. No one ever has or will say \"wow this company has great service. Their AI bot was so helpful, I'm going to buy more of their products and recommend them to my friends!\" Personally, I don't care how good AI gets. I want to talk to a human when I need support, ESPECIALLY if I'm paying your company for a product already. I think linking to an FAQ based on your initial quick description of your question is great for fielding basic common questions, but past that, let me talk to a person. Plus, can we stop sweeping the environmental concerns of AI under the rug? Do we really need a chatbot trained on stolen data and slave labor consuming cities worth of electricity and clean water just so you can save 200k a year by not hiring a few people...? Hard agree! People prefer to talk to people when they’re trying to get in contact with a support person! Plus bots/AI are only as good as the data fed into them from LLMs, not to mention that there aren’t… checks notes …any federal/GDPR/UK regulations on AI/LLMs. Not to mention the environmental concerns on AI too! Just like crypto, AI uses up a fuckton of energy for a single transaction! I personally will never implement anything AI for any kind of thing, whether it be for my phone or for a Salesforce implementation, and I don’t care if I’m the outlier in the SF ecosystem who will never implement anything AI I disagree a bit with the first point. People just want their problem solved. Links to FAQs are the tip of the iceberg with agentic models. You can do so much more. I would much rather work with an ai agent to solve my problem now,  than be on hold for hours to speak to a real person. Granted, that's not the reality now, but that's where it is going. The ethical concerns are very real though. I disagree. People want to talk to a human at the moment because their experience with previous chatbots have been awful. If I can authenticate through Agentforce, and get the bot to answer my question, solve my problem, or get a task done - then I am happy to use it rather than wait 20 minutes when a human is available. I'm just stating my opinion. Totally understandable if you feel a different way. Idk, on top of what I've already mentioned here, I'm also just getting really sick of how impersonal AI is making everything. I don't always love my experience with support agents, but I do actually like learning, troubleshooting, and puzzle solving. I don't get the dopamine of an \"Aha!\" Moment from AI spitting out a generic, good-enough answer, and I don't get to learn anything on the journey to that answer, so it'll just further increase my reliance on AI instead of making me better at what I'm working on. Personally I don't WANT to see a world where AI is making all of our art, music, and movies. I don't want AI to make decisions for me, summarize my friends and family's messages and reply automatically, drive my car, or cook my food. I much prefer leaving AI to speed up scientific and medical progress instead of stealing my hobbies and interests (and destroying the planet in the process) 100% Bots are really annoying and helpless. When I'm reaching for customer support, i don't want to talk to a bot, I want a human. I'm not alone in my camp. It's not a bot. It's generative AI, and they are very different. Bots are frustrating because you have to go through a logic tree. AI can respond, and make logical decisions. Example, I have an issue with my internet. I reset my router, and take a couple of other troubleshooting steps. The bot is going to force me through the logic tree, whereas if I tell the AI Agent what I already attempted to do it's going to understand to skip those steps. I was contacting my insurance company a little bit ago to get proof of insurance docs since they were failing to download from the usual location. Support brought me to a genAI bot first. I said \"Can I get proof of insurance documents emailed to me\" and it said something along the lines of \"I don't know what that means, can you rephrase the question?\" I tried several different ways of wording it, and finally asked for a person. I asked \"Can I get proof of insurance documents emailed to me\" and they said, sure no problem and emailed them to me. I have Progressive, too, not some tiny no name insurance. I get that it's sort of up to Progressive to train the model better, but if it can't understand such a basic and routine task, it just slows things down. In another example, a doctors office I was trying to make an appointment with used an AI phone answering service. It brought me in loops for 5 minutes before saying it needed additional information before it could schedule an appointment and to schedule on their website instead. Their website told me I needed to call in to provide additional information. I went to a different doctor. And again, maybe an AI bot gets you an answer a little quicker than an underpaid offshore support agent reading from a script sometimes, but good support goes a long way for referrals and good reviews. Zero people will do either because of a convo with AI. And to me, an AI bot tells me the company cares more about saving money than offering good support, making their customers happy, creating jobs, or lowering their carbon footprint. None of those things improve my perception of the company. Edit: also of note, Salesforce themselves don't even use Agentforce when you start a chat with their support. There is a button to do so, but it is not the default. If they don't stand behind their product 100% then why should their customers?",

Plus bots/AI are only as good as the data fed into them from LLMs, not to mention that there aren’t… checks notes …any federal/GDPR/UK regulations on AI/LLMs. Not to mention the environmental concerns on AI too! Just like crypto, AI uses up a fuckton of energy for a single transaction! I personally will never implement anything AI for any kind of thing, whether it be for my phone or for a Salesforce implementation, and I don’t care if I’m the outlier in the SF ecosystem who will never implement anything AI",

I would much rather work with an ai agent to solve my problem now,  than be on hold for hours to speak to a real person. Granted, that's not the reality now, but that's where it is going.

If I can authenticate through Agentforce, and get the bot to answer my question, solve my problem, or get a task done - then I am happy to use it rather than wait 20 minutes when a human is available. I'm just stating my opinion. Totally understandable if you feel a different way.

As always clients don’t always know what they are getting into here and the product is far from perfect. In fact it’s got allot of issues and few upsides currently imo. For the cost, I would much rather have clients implement something more capable like a voiceflow agent or n8n agents. Agentforce will get there (who knows how long that will take). But I would recommend you get familiar with this tool(s) = agentforce + datacloud",

      "commentBody": "I actually just got back from TDX yesterday, and, of course, Agentforce was 1000% the main focus in every regard. Sure it’s the shiny new thing, but nearly every single session I attended had a tie to agents/an agentic solution. It was interesting to see just how hard Salesforce is pushing it and the marketing they’ve put behind it. On the other side, I attended one circles of success session on reporting & dashboards, and people genuinely cheered when the presenter said this session doesn’t have any mention of Agentforce. So Salesforce can push it as much as they want, but seems like many Admins/Devs/Business Analysts/Architects etc. don’t see the full value yet, myself included. I’d be nervous to be an early adopter at this point just due to my org’s current data quality issues, but am interested to see where the product is at in a year and beyond. Finally, Patrick Stoke’s message during the main keynote of “so world population is declining, and there’s this massive global labor shortage, and the solution is building Salesforce agents!!!” fell short for me and completely glossed over the ethical/resource concerns AI creates.",

Agentic AI and specifially Agentforce is disruption at a different level. It goes back to the line from 2 years ago at World Economic Forum - AI wont replace jobs, it is people who are using AI that will.  Agentforce is quickly capturing agentic in the flow of work. My take: watch CNX and Dreamforce for what is to come.",

I don’t know if this is because a cost analysis of shipping is being done in the background and determining a return unprofitable, if it’s because it’s a fairly easy task to program an AI to do, or because the value gains of replacing a customer service person with AI allows them to take the financial loss. Maybe it’s just foolhardy early adoption of a technology that we overestimate the value of. Whatever the case, I highly recommend the excellent experience of getting free stuff while the tech is in its infancy.",

The concept goes beyond your typical chatbot. That said, what we've seen so far feels pretty light — the Dreamforce demo wasn’t exactly groundbreaking (\"ask the agent for the schedule\" isn’t blowing anyone’s mind). So the potential is there, but the execution? Still very much TBD . If Salesforce delivers on the deep integration and workflow automation, it could be a game-changer.
