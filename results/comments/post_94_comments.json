    "postMessage": "Hi! üëã I‚Äôve been lurking in this space and wanted some advice on how to get into Salesforce Administration. I am currently an Office Manager in the public sector where I process information on the database my company uses and raise purchase orders, manage the office and answer queries via email and liaise with stakeholders. It‚Äôs a care related database, nothing to do with salesforce. I‚Äôm looking to up-skill and increase my salary since I‚Äôm at risk of redundancy and wanted to know more about Salesforce Administration. What does your day to day look like? What advice would you recommend to get into it? Is there a qualification? If so, what‚Äôs the exam process like? All advice really appreciated, thanks in advance!",
