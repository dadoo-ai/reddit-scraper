    "postMessage": "I'm working as a Salesforce Developer for a App Exchange application. I'm able to package the version the code working well in packaging and other development environment but after packing I installed it on another development environment to test. But there I'm getting issues in code. But I need to debug exactly in which line I'm getting the error. In normal debug logs I won't get these logs so if there a way I can debug those to identify issue. Any insights from Salesforce Appexchange Developers or Architects are highly appreciated.",

      "commentBody": "Going through the LMA via subscriber support access is the right answer, and 99% of the time that'll do for what you need. Remember to have the client grant login access to you and know which org ID it is so that you can navigate to it.\n\n\\--\n\nSometimes though, that's not possible, such as in some regulated environments where ISVs are not permitted direct access to systems. Or when encountering intermittent issues where you need the actual user to do actual work in order to encounter the problem.\n\nSalesforce can unmask the logs for your namespace in a specific client org. You would need to submit a case via the partner portal and convince the handling agent that you have the authority to unmask the logs. You'll need the org ID for the client org and the package ID or the version ID (I forget which they ask for) along with the package name and namespace. \n\nThe unmasking is for a timeframe (it's very temporary) then you can get all the details while running under the client's login. They can't see your code still, but the debug logs from your package are visible including the line numbers.",
