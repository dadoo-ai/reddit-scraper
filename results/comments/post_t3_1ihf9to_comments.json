    "postMessage": "I've contacted Salesforce through Agentforce chat and I got the feeling that its not useful at all as it was just looping and circling around couple answers... my question was trivial, im not able to login on my special org for a superbadge and im not able to reset my password as well (security question issue). And from here, the agentforce is not able to help nor connect me to real agent.\nMy point here is, if someone before reached out to Salesforce through agentforce and he got the help needed?",

However, I just tried and it immediately sent me to a human when I asked. I don't know what your issue is. Do you have the chat log? <image> Your account you were logged in with is probably not entitled to live support.  Must not be one for a paying customer org. As others said, you need to contact TraIlhead support. Ironically I got the same thing when logged in with a paid Premiere Success account. I bailed out, went to the ticket submission and was able to chat from there. u/UnpopularCrayon u/rwh12345 good luck The fact that youâ€™re tagging people like itâ€™s proving a point yet you canâ€™t comprehend that youâ€™re doing a trailhead and expecting salesforce production support to assist you with your trailhead module is hilarious As I (and others) have already stated, trailhead has an entirely different support team. You going to help.salesforce.com is not trailhead support. Itâ€™s quite literally stated in the above comment. So again, maybe try reaching out to the appropriate team Quite the opposite, you need to open your mind and face reality. Salesforce is phasing out human support and sunsetting that feature. Many others have mentioned that they are unable to contact live support at certain times. From your writings, it seems like you contacted support a couple of months ago and didn't face any issues. I'm tagging you to see other stuff that are not inside ur head. Your entire post is about a super badge not working, and youâ€™re going to Salesforce production support to get help. Iâ€™m not sure how this is incorrect. Youâ€™re literally trying to have production support resources (AI and people) trying to solve your issue, when you arenâ€™t in a production org.

      "commentBody": "SF has purposely forced customers through Agentforce rather than regular support channels to try to drive adoption and increase the appearance of value in the half-baked thing. It's mostly  just pissed customers off. Not a single support tech uses the internally pushed AI tools, and for good reason, you'd get shit answers just like agentforce. exactly this! Same Q to you as well â€“Â would you use Agentforce for enabling sales teams? If no, why not? Ouch, that's a spicy one. Would you use Agentforce for enabling sales teams? Or same verdict? Depends on what you need it for. Agentforce has value, but it is only as good as the data behind it and the actions built into it. If you need your teams to be able to ask simple questions that are baked into your data, that is easy to handle. \"What is X customer's next payment date?\" or something like that, no problem if you have it stored. It struggles when expanding out into larger and more complex things. Using it to say handle any technical question a person could ask about the salesforce platform for example, not the best idea. For small scope questions favoring ease of use with a sales teams I can definitely see value. If you want to do forecasting with it, I don't think it's is there yet. Thank you for the elaborate response! And forecasting is the holy grail of course. Curious how fast SF gets a handle on that - shouldnâ€™t be impossible with white glove service at all AI firms plus the infinite amount of data they have access toâ€¦ Do you know anyone who really likes Agentforce? Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time on this sub today and would love to speak with a die-hard power user",
