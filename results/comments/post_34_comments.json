We have tools like zoominfo, but not the higher tier plan that automatically looks at our instance and enriches it. How do you track people changing accounts while still retaining the history. Would love to hear any and all solutions.",

We are looking at using account contact relationship and a status on the old contact to identify them as no longer employed &amp; filter those out in reporting/list views and create a new contact at the new company.  In our work, we don’t need to utilize the historical of previous activities at old jobs.  We also looked at using a flow to utilize the same contact but haven’t gotten that far with that yet.  Data enrichment and data quality is always struggle if the users don’t maintain the data.",
