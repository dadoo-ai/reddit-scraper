    "postMessage": "Hello all, I‚Äôm fairly new to the Salesforce eco system just had a quick question! I‚Äôve created a custom junction object (it has 2 masters) and looking to make this junction object a master. After creating a new custom object I can‚Äôt seem to make the junction object the parent as it doesn‚Äôt appear in the master - detail relationship list? Just wondering if I‚Äôm missing something here ü§î I‚Äôm in a fresh sandbox just for a bit more context! Thanks in advance ‚ù§Ô∏è",
