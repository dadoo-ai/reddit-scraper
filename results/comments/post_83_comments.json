    "postMessage": "I'm creating an App Exchange app that creates templated sets of tasks along with allowing the progress of the tasks to be tracked.  Think of onboarding a new client: each client has a series of steps assigned to different people.  If anyone is interested in beta testing this please let me know. More info at https://www.youtube.com/@SimplyEZTech Thanks! Note: Unlink action plans in Salesforce, this app can create dependencies, show a visual of how all tasks are created, along with being able to plan out events based on when tasks they depend on are completed.",

I hope its a  2gp package to avoid the hassle on conversion in the future.  \n  \nAlso, listing on appexchange requires to have a registered company IMO.(Although there are creative workarounds) If its free, listing fees is waived off else its $1000.",

I have published 2 managed packages(on behalf of my employers) and we do this all the time to collect indirect feedback.\n\n\nAlso, having a closed group of users to test out your package with different Salesforce editions and configs would be helpful.",
