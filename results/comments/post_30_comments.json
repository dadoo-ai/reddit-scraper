Then the agent calls a flow, and for each item it prompts the user for the text to be creeated. Is it possible to ask for a input like that from within the flow ? Appreciate any help",

      "commentBody": "I generally agree with what was said about,  although I don't fully understand your intention.   Number of likes?  Like Facebook likes?  What are we talking about here?  If it is Facebook likes,  it's it find all posts by that user with this many likes or greater,  award that many likes etc.?  \n\nLike he said,  deterministic automatons don't require agents,  but also agents don't start out with asking a question,  other than how may I help you.   Once you determine what you're trying to do,  and agent could be equipped with a tool that does it,  but it also feels like a proper l prompt template might be more what you're looking for.   Prompt templates can take information from resources like salesforce objects, and combine them into a pre- configured prompt to an llm.  The main question is,  do you need non- deterministic intelligence/ judgment which am llm can augment the already existing capabilities of computers?  Look up that word deterministic if you're not sure what I mean.",
