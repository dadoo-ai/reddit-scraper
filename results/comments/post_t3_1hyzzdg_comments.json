    "postMessage": "\"Agentforce helps prevent fashion fails\" or whatever? It seems like the commercial came straight out of marc benioff or some super high level marketing person detached from the real world with zero pushback. And I guess the joke is that we can clearly see Matthew is dressed ridiculously, but so did we need AI for that? It's the dumbest commercial I've seen in a while and all I see is this ad, prescription medications, and online gambling (Michigan lol)",

They just gave Mathew a fuck ton of money to be his friend and had to justify it somehow. they have him like what, 10 mil before laying people off? Why worry about retaining valuable employees when your CEO can buy a cool friend?",

You see what we did with AI at Salesforce? People are going WILD over anything with “agent” in the name. MM: adjusts sunglasses thoughtfully You know what I love about AI agents, Marc? I keep getting older, but they stay the same capability. MB: 😂 True! Yesterday I sneezed and said “excuse me, agent” and three VCs offered me $50 million in funding. MM: That’s what I love about Silicon Valley, man. Time is a flat circle of hype cycles. Remember crypto? NFTs? Now it’s all “agent” this and “agent” that. MB: I’m telling you, Matthew, I could release a product called “AgentForce: The Assistant’s Assistant for Assistants” and it would be oversubscribed before lunch. MM: nods philosophically You ever watch a golden retriever chase its tail, Marc? That’s Silicon Valley right now with AI agents. Round and round they go... MB: Speaking of which, want to invest in my new startup? It’s called “AgentCoin” - it’s like Bitcoin but every transaction is handled by an AI agent wearing a tiny digital suit. MM: long contemplative stare Now that’s what I call a sales force, brother. MB: See what you did there! But seriously, I just typed “agent” into a blank Google doc and my company’s stock went up 3%. MM: You know why this works, Marc? Because in this industry... be a lot cooler if you did 😎",
