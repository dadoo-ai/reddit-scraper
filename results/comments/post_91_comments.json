The YouTube videos. I remember one time when I was getting started in salesforce I was trying to get something working in a flow, and SFB made a video on it, but the hid the details of setting the element up. They set it up before the video and never explained how they did it. They just showed the finished result. It was kind of ridiculous and other people in the comments were point out how silly it was to omit the part everyone watched the video for.\n\nThey just leave out details a lot, it‚Äôs just never been helpful for me.",
