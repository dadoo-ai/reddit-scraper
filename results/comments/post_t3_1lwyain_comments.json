They are banking on the hype right now, just like every other company. None of them are particularly innovative, just following tends Its a shame because it used to feel like Salesforce actually cared about what customers wanted, but these days all they seem to do is tell customers what they should want, whether or not it's actually useful for them. With Agentforce it feels like they've dialed that behaviour up to 11. It‚Äôs not just Salesforce. Pretty hard to find a single publicly traded corporation that gives a shit about anything but next quarters profits BINGO!!! It's frustrating for employees too, it's being crammed down throats inside and out. The worst part is it's been used to justify price increases yet our edition doesn't even give it to us.",

I'll say one positive sign moving towards a world where Agentforce starts solving real problems is that they are now hiring folks from legacy AI tools at least in sales. I met an AE who has a deep understanding of the product and AI landscape and in 30 minutes of talking to him I learned more about how Agentforce works and can help businesses than the last 2 years of Salesforce marketing. But even he said there are no companies he knows of using it fully across the board effectively. A lot of POCs.",

It gave me a link to a page that didn't have the information I asked for, and when I told it that, it said I should reach out to an AE for info. To be fair, when I asked the Agent on the help.salesforce.com page the same question, I did get the info I needed.

Case creation: the guided case creation is quicker than the old click through, and it handles all the orgid etc. especially good when it‚Äôs doing it off the back of a chat that it couldn‚Äôt resolve. Frankly, I was HUGELY impressed by their support implementation compared to the shoddy human responses you‚Äôd get before. But the rest of it is just hype, I‚Äôm really hoping that I can get it to work as a deal desk type function. This is more how bad their support is generally and less how good Agentforce is. Haha, true. But I do think the feature activation is a really cool use case I will give them that, that's pretty handy! Hard pass on ‚Äúfaster case creation‚Äù. It struggles with slight deviations from the norm like an error in sandbox and often creates cases without required fields or places them in the wrong divisions. Instead of entering what I want, I‚Äôm stuck negotiating I know, I hate answering one question at a time, just give me a form üòÆ‚Äçüí® My first experience with it was asking to create a case. When I was done I was wishing I could just drive over it with my car. So I imagined doing that - didn't help.",

      "commentBody": "What I found is the biggest problem with the support agent is that SF stuffed all of their help documentation into it all versions and products.  We have all complained that SF documentation is massive, strung out all over the place, and doesn't always catch up with official documentation and release notes. When we've built help Agents on Agentforce, we follow these basic best practices for our clients: 1) Each Knowledge Article or uploaded document is its own complete topic and thing. 2) Do not overlap content or contract information from one help article to the next 3) Version control of your help articles - don't have version 1 articles mixed in with version 2 articles. 4) If you are a software product - release notes and documentation have to be synced, if you retire a feature make sure its all out of your documentation - everywhere. It would be nice if SF followed their own best practices when building their own support Agent. Yeah and I think that's a huge problem - if they can't get their new flagship product to work properly, how can their customers be expected to implement, support, and maintain something so nuanced. How do you think we SIs make money ;-) Yes I've been on both sides of the fence but on the end user side now. Once the project is done it's up to someone like me to keep it up and running and it's getting a lot harder to keep up with what's changing...I don't see Agentforce making it easier in the short or medium term.",

      "commentBody": "Awhile back i tried it, as someone, in another thread stated that SF used agentforce 'very successfully' (or along those lines), in their support. I then went ahead and tried it. This was my experience: To begin with, this looks like something that could be done with any external AI. First question (I have a decision split, with these configurations. Are these case sensitive? Subject contains forsikring and CreatedDate is on or after Today Minus 60 days or Subject contains fordel and CreatedDate is on or after Today Minus 60 days) Correct answer straight away (on another note, this should be specified when you setup a decision split). When asking for a source where I can read more, it gives me this https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=mktg.mc_jb_configuration_recommendations.htm&type=5 Just to be clear, there's no mention about case sensitive decision splits in this article. Next question is about cloudpages, and implementing a presentation in js / html. It starts answering questions, just to delete it and say \"Sorry, I had trouble coming up with a response for your request. Could you please try rephrasing your question?\" However, if I ask Le Chat the exact same question I get an answer, with sources. I tried using an agent to create flows and journeys..... let's just say, that, that is very, very basic. This is my experience so far, every \"AI enabled\" tool is significantly worse than me just copy + pasting the question into gemini or chatgpt... so why would I bother or even pay extra for it... like, a super basic tool that could win a lot of people over... AI support on formula fields builders checing syntax and doing type ahead shit... but no, they want a chatbot that just gets in the way of actually serving customers properly.",

I pretend to be on the bandwagon so that my \"visionary\" boss is happy, but I'm so rooting for this fad to pass... AI has it's uses in data analysys and clean up as part of the ecosystem, hell, even a an assistant for typing notes and emails, or give me something that creates a flow based on me giving it requirments, but stop pretending that everything has to be AI. ffs sometimes I feel like just leaving salesforce and go learn something like SAP or whatever.",

      "commentBody": "I am implementing the co-pilot agent for my org, and it‚Äôs shockingly terrible. They have these pre-created topics to find records, extract object details based on user input, etc, but it seems to really, really struggle when it comes to doing things in mass. One example; we have a use-case where I need to get some records, loop through and process them in a flow (since they don‚Äôt have any topics to create data). When I ask it to find records, it works great (despite it having a LIMIT 50 in its query‚Ä¶), but when I ask it to pass those (up to) 50 records to an sObject collection in a flow, it only ever passes 25 records, never more. Asking the AI expert that I got in contact with from my AE, they said they can‚Äôt find this documented anywhere and in demos / use cases they never asked it to do things in bulk so they never ran into this‚Ä¶ Have a case open with support, but I have a very strong feeling that they will create some documentation saying it‚Äôs a limit instead of actually fixing the issue. I know it can be fixed by only passing along the IDs and querying the record myself in a GET, but what‚Äôs the point of skipping all the out of the box logic with custom, leading to significantly less data accuracy? Same with the out of the box update topic. Works great, but again you have to confirm the update for every single record. So my conclusion is;\nWorks nicely for working with single records, not so much in bulk.",

We are downloading a RLM Managed Package (not Revenue Cloud Advance) we are then setting up our unstructured data into the managed packaged structured data model. We then are activating all the standard logic. Then we are going to train the agent. The use case we are trying to built is an Agent that can talk with people like Marketing, BDRs, and Sales.  We are then going to help buyer buy through a frictionless buyer commerce journey. Then we will automate the post-sales process and train the AI to give executives the reports they need. We believe the structuring of our data in this single data model solution that standardize our business process will help us get meaningful results from Agentforce. Any advice on what you have learned? What not to do‚Äôs and not trying is not what I am seeking. Anything would be great from all of you who have been trying.",

We happen to be in the phase where it‚Äôs not scaled enough to be good yet, but the only way for it to get good is to peddle it.

It was a great innovation that did a bunch of things mediocrely. All of this improved with adoption and feedback. Another example is chipsets.
