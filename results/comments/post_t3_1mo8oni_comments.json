      "commentBody": "Summarizing interactions can reduce after call work and reduce the time it takes for an agent to review a customer's history. Searching knowledge bases, especially messy ones (aka nearly all knowledge bases), can be sped up with LLMs. I've seen a custom solution do this well with a frontier model and no fine tuning, and we are currently doing a PoC with Agentforce that I assume will do just as well. I have also seen demos of real-time agent assist capabilities that find knowledge articles, propose scripted responses, and propose next best actions that looked very promising. We will be implementing this next year after we do the foundational work upgrading our telephony integration to stream real-time transcriptions into Service Cloud Voice. Based on some time tracking research, we think we can reduce our average handle time by 15%. Our research actually suggested 25-30% reductions, but we know our agents aren't robots who will always make optimal use of these tools. Past projects have on average saved around 60% of our calculated projections that didn't include this human factor, which is why we think a 15% reduction is likely. The cost of Agentforce and our CCaaS upgrades is about 3% of our variable contact center budget, so after including these additional costs we could still easily save 10-15% of our total cost center budget by the end of next year. We have very high attrition in that department, so we won't even need layoffs to realize those savings. We might have to move around some managers and directors, though, who have far less attrition. We don't yet have confidence in using LLMs in our IVR systems or chat bots, but I'm nearly certain that it is coming soon. I think our lawyers becoming confident that we won't be liable for anything these AI agents say will be the biggest hurdle. If disclaimers are sufficient to make sure we don't have to honor an LLM being tricked into saying a product costs $1 instead of $1000, I think we'll probably start using Agentforce for call deflection in 2027. TLDR, we plan on spending $3M annually on Agentforce next year and are confident we'll save around $15-20M annually (most savings wont start until late 2026, though). Maybe I'll remember to come back here in 18 months to let everyone know how it went. Roughly how many contact centre users do you have?",

The AI helps with intent detection, routing, and knowledge-based responses, which can significantly reduce agent workload and improve first-response times. However, a common challenge I see is that many implementations overlook multichannel consistency customers expect the same fast, contextual replies whether theyâ€™re on email, SMS, or WhatsApp. Thatâ€™s where solutions like SMS Ninja integrate seamlessly with Salesforce to unify messaging channels (SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.) into one inbox. This means Agentforceâ€™s AI can work across all channels, while your team still benefits from features like link-open tracking, event dashboards, and automated follow-ups leading to both faster resolutions and higher satisfaction scores. This sounds like an AI response.",
