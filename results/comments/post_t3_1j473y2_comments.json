This kind of defeats the trust principles. This is the gist\nData Masking is disabled for all the use cases related to Agentforce. The reason behind this\ndecision is - while data masking is vital for securing customer privacy, it can hinder the\ncontextual accuracy and relevance of outputs in certain cases‚Äîsuch as the planner and action\nworkflows within Agentforce. For example, if a user asks the Einstein Agent to build a list of\nsimilar accounts, the LLM (Large Language Model) needs the actual details of the referenced\naccount. If these details are masked, the model lacks the necessary context to identify similar\naccounts effectively.\nTo enhance our approach to safeguard customer data and privacy for Agentforce Agents use\ncases, soon we will be offering Anthropic Sonnet LLM as an option which will be hosted within\nour Trusted Boundary and managed by Salesforce.

      "commentBody": "TLDR: Atlas reasoning engine is based on OpenAI GPT4o. That model is an \"Attention is All You Need\" language model that needs 100% of context. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need Example: in romance languages, the gender of a person's name impacts the tone of how an email is written in a foreign language. Data masking causes hallucinations when substituting tokens that aren't in the training data set, and was probably impacting how Atlas constructs a set of next actions. So basically they want you to rely on the zero data retention policy and deal salesforce has with OpenAI and other LLM providers? Salesforce has no proprietary deal with OpenAI around trust. Only a licensing deal and DPA, the same as every other Developer. https://openai.com/policies/data-processing-addendum/ OpenAI is being used by NSA, CIA, FBI... and their https://trust.openai.com/ portal has an over-abundance of security and privacy information. At one time not too long ago (~2 years), OpenAI did have toxicity, hallucination and data retraining issues. What trust cloud sought to address. But in AI internet years, things move very fast. OpenAI, and all enterprise-class LLMs, are orders of magnitude more secure, cheaper, faster, and better.",

Salesforce has no proprietary deal with OpenAI around trust. Only a licensing deal and DPA, the same as every other Developer. https://openai.com/policies/data-processing-addendum/ OpenAI is being used by NSA, CIA, FBI... and their https://trust.openai.com/ portal has an over-abundance of security and privacy information. At one time not too long ago (~2 years), OpenAI did have toxicity, hallucination and data retraining issues. What trust cloud sought to address. But in AI internet years, things move very fast. OpenAI, and all enterprise-class LLMs, are orders of magnitude more secure, cheaper, faster, and better.",

      "commentBody": "\"For Agentforce, currently Data Masking is disabled, however this feature is still available on other Einstein Generative AI features and customer developed functions (such as flows).\" Ok, it's disabled for Agentforce. But isn't it all Agentforce? I'm trying to understand precisely in what cases is it not disabled? What does \"such as flows\" mean? Does anyone have a concrete answer?",
