      "commentBody": "Salesforce doesnât natively automate data entry from calls, emails, or documents beyond things like Einstein Activity Capture. For more advanced automation, you usually need to build a custom integration.\n\nIn one of my projects, the customer wanted to auto-fill details in a custom object from sales call recordings. Since the recordings were already stored in Salesforce, we kicked off an API call directly from Salesforce to a Django middleware. The Django server ran an AI model on Azure to transcribe and extract key details, then returned the structured JSON back to Salesforce through REST API endpoints. Salesforce updated the relevant records automatically, and managers could review/approve the auto-filled details through the standard approval process.\n\nSo yes, itâs definitely possible but usually requires a middleware + AI service + Salesforce APIs. The same approach can be applied to emails, calendars, or documents depending on the use case.",

              "commentBody": "Flow + Prompt Builder are definitely useful, but they still depend on someone providing input to the prompt. The main challenge here is cutting down manual data entry â and thatâs where these tools can fall a bit short.\n\nIn my case, since the recordings were already in Salesforce, we automated it by calling out to a Django middleware running an Azure AI model. The transcription and field extraction happened automatically, and Salesforce updated the records without any manual keying.\n\nSo I see Flow/Prompt Builder as great for guided input, but if the goal is âzero manual entry,â an external AI/middleware usually has to handle the heavy lifting.\n\nIf youâve managed to achieve the same kind of automation purely with Flow + Prompt Builder, Iâd love to hear how you set that up that would really help me understand your scenario better.",

                      "commentBody": "Just to clarify â Iâm not advertising Django ð Iâm a Salesforce Developer, and I only mentioned Django because that happened to be the middleware we used. I actually implemented this, I just polished my wording with AI so it came across politely, not because I didnât know what I was talking about.\n\nThe real requirement was zero manual data entry from audio recordings. Thatâs where Flow/Prompt Builder/Agentforce on their own fall short.\n\nWhy middleware was necessary in our case:\n\nAudio transcription: Flow doesnât natively handle binary audio or live speech-to-text. We needed Azure STT for that.\n\nStructured extraction: NLP converted transcripts into a strict JSON schema that mapped directly to Salesforce fields.\n\nAsync + size/time limits: Long calls needed chunking, retries, and async handling â not feasible inside a single Flow run.\n\nGovernance &amp; ops: Middleware gave us logging, PII redaction, error handling, versioning, and cost control.\n\nIdempotency &amp; scale: Middleware ensured reliable updates back into Salesforce via REST/Platform Events.\n\nFor live calls: If the customer wants values captured while the call is happening, middleware is even more critical. Streaming audio â real-time transcription â NLP â Salesforce updates is simply outside the scope of Flow/Prompt Builder today.\n\nOur flow looked like:\n\n1. Recording (stored in Salesforce) triggered an API call.\n\n2. Middleware (Django in our case) sent audio to Azure STT â transcript.\n\n3. NLP extracted structured data â JSON.\n\n4. JSON sent back into Salesforce â records updated automatically â managers could approve.\n\nSo yes, Flow and Prompt Builder are fantastic for guided/manual entry and orchestrating processes. But if the goal is fully automated, no-touch data entry from audio (especially live calls), an external AI/middleware layer is essential.\n\nIf youâve managed to achieve end-to-end transcription + JSON field mapping purely with Flow/Prompt Builder, Iâd genuinely love to learn how you did it â especially how you handled audio ingestion and structured extraction. That would be really insightful.",
