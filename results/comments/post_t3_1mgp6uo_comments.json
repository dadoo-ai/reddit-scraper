    "postMessage": "Hi everyone, Iâ€™ve recently been assigned to an Agentforce project, while the scope isnâ€™t too complex, itâ€™s my first time implementing it for a large client. The timeline is quite tight, and Iâ€™m heading on vacation soon, so everything landed rather unexpectedly. Iâ€™m reaching out to see if anyone with experience in Agentforce would be open to a quick call/or text/or whatever how it works, to guide me through solving the business case. Iâ€™d of course be happy to compensate for your time. My main challenge at the moment is building the Flows. Iâ€™m still fairly new to the Salesforce ecosystem and investing a lot of time learning as I go. I am asking this because I donâ€™t feel confident that I can finish it on time.  It will be entirely in a dev Agentforce org via Trailhead and keeping everything strictly confidential. Thank you",

      "commentBody": "Youâ€™re gonna need to focus on auto launches flows. And what kind of agent? Sales, service, SDR, employee? Make sure you have your data cloud setup. I would HIGHLY recommend you get your company to just fork over for the data cloud sandbox so that you can actually use devops. Where is this agent going to live? Internal or on a portal? Youâ€™re going to have to set up routing if itâ€™s on a portal. Make sure youâ€™re tracking your agent like you would an employee, bc you WILL have to create a user for it: keep documentation of the naming convention, its OOTB perm sets, and custom ones you build. And if this is an agent thatâ€™s going to be using knowledge, make sure itâ€™s squared away BEFORE you turn on Data Cloud. TLDR: message me if you get stuck.",

You're doing the right thing by asking for help early. Iâ€™ve worked on a few Agentforce implementations, and I know Flows can be tricky, especially if youâ€™re still getting comfortable with the Salesforce ecosystem. If you're open to it, Iâ€™d be happy to walk you through the basics or review what youâ€™ve built so far. I can also point you toward some practical Flow examples that are Agentforce-specific. We can figure out a time for a quick call or chat. Just DM me with your availability, and we can take it from there. Youâ€™ve got this; sometimes all it takes is a quick nudge in the right direction.",

You most probably need to create custom actions using flows and if the task is complex you may need to use Apex actions as well. There are many resources where you can learn agentforce and custom actions but i m not sure if you have that kuch time.",
