      "commentBody": "Reposting a repost of my previous comment here in case others like you haven’t seen it yet: “I posted this comment in another thread after I left the conference: “So I just left the Agentforce world tour in NYC and here was my takeaway: Agentforce is the marriage of some new declarative tools (prompt builder, agent actions), your existing business processes (flow and apex), and LLM. The goal is to get you to build “Agents”. These agents will have specific goals/roles that will leverage all the above things in a way that is conversational to the end user. For your customers, this will take the form of chat bots. For internal users this will take the form of the Einstein Copilot Agent (which can be further customized with Agent Actions to do more complex queries and actions, such as using an existing flow to update a record). Some good convos I had: Einstein chatbots are now Agents. An agent is comprised of a series of Topics (what is the intent of the end user?) and Actions (what should we do with the end users request?). The Atlas reasoning engine evaluates the input for the user, determines the Topic, and then executes the Action(s). These actions can be apex or flow defined (e.g. a flow that changes the status of a field) or new things like a prompt. The Agentforce sku basically has two types: internal (being used by salesforce users, not customer facing), and external (customer facing, usually as a chatbot). While the underlying tech stack is the same, if you use the external facing sku it is billed as consumption based ($2 per convo). The example I learned about from the Sales cloud booth was an SDR agent that basically comes preloaded with all the actions you would need to essentially let the Agent qualify new leads (it would belong to a user specific to that agent and emails would come from the agent). It uses LLM to interpret the responses and either send a new response or you can have it alert the sales rep they should take action. This would be considered an External SKU and therefore each email chain between a lead and the agent is considered a conversation and costs $2. However…this does not exactly preclude you from using the Internal SKU to do the same thing (in theory). You’d have to basically create all the Agent Actions from scratch, but you could in theory then just call a flow action that sends the emails instead of the “agent”. No promises on that though lol. Data cloud is being sold as a lynchpin to all of these but you can build some rather robust agents just off salesforce data alone. Data clouds big addition is being able to pull in data from other sources and agents can use these data model objects (particularly interesting is how you can read unstructured data, like a PDF of an invoice or a contract housed in another system and it can read and interpret this to use in the agent actions.) Prompt builder is really cool, and by itself it is essentially a really powerful way for users to build SOQL queries using natural language, but if it is part of an Agent it seems this can be leveraged in other ways (like drafting emails). To your point about what does Agentforce do that flow orchestration can’t and I think it ultimately comes down to the Atlas reasoning engine. Flow orchestration looks very similar but you as the admin/developer need to establish the if, then logic and again it’s still pretty much all based on events against the database or platform. The reasoning engine replaces the need for a DML or platform event to trigger an action, instead relying on conversational prompts to execute a sequence of actions. Anyway, it’s still a lot of fluff and from my vantage point this could be really powerful for B2C business but it’s hard to see a ton of use cases for my company. I will say this is honestly a really impressive step forward towards making LLMs work for your business with declarative tools, and this seems to be the shiny toy they’re deploying all their resources toward. Additionally: the most impressive thing I saw was their Agentforce Accelerator. It was literally a “prompt builder” but for setting up and Agent. You just described the process you wanted, answered a few questions, and then it went and actually created the Agent, Agent Actions, and Topics for you. Would be a time saver in the order of hundreds of hours and probably the most impressive thing they showed. No word on if/when it will be GA.” This is a great summary - thanks for taking the time. One thing to clarify- Einstein chatbots are not agents. Agents are agents (generative) and separate of Einstein bots (somewhat predictive). Bots are very linear while agents can contextually decide on what to say and do next which is the added benefit of where AI is now Yea I know but the lady at the Agentforce booth I talked to basically said bots will be replaced by agents. This is the direction they’re heading and I’d be surprised if you can build bots in the next few years. They’re all in on the agent concept That is not correct. Bots will remain. However what is happening is bots would ideally be redeployed on what is called MIAW, as opposed to the legacy chat framework which was limited to just chat. Messaging In App and Web (miaw) supports many more channels. Do you work there on the product team? I remember you had a very good response to a very similar thread on my comment and you seem like you know more than I do about this framework? My comments are solely based off the implication I received in not so many words that agents are the future and bots will basically be put out to pasture. If you know better than that please let me know! Not trying to spread false info. I have been at the Agentforce World Tour in NYC having long discussion to sales leaders on what possibilities are coming out, and while I’m impressed with what they’re building, I have some thoughts on where it fits in and where there’s still room for improvement. Agentforce is doing a great job of blending declarative tools, LLMs, and workflows. The idea of “agents” instead of just chatbots is a solid evolution—these aren’t just FAQ bots but systems that can execute actions, like updating a record or triggering a flow. The Atlas reasoning engine powering it is impressive, especially in how it evaluates user input and maps it to Topics (intent) and Actions (tasks). Some quick highlights: Prompt Builder & Accelerator: These were standout features. Prompt Builder simplifies generating queries or drafting emails with natural language. And the Accelerator? Game-changing. It lets you describe your process and builds an entire Agent for you, saving hours of manual setup. Internal vs. External Use Cases: Internal Agents (like Einstein Copilot) are practical for teams, but external ones ($2 per convo) could get expensive quickly, especially for customer-facing use cases. They demoed an SDR Agent preloaded to qualify leads via email—cool, but potentially pricey for high-volume operations. Data Cloud: Adding data from multiple sources is nice, but you can still build robust agents with just Salesforce data. That said, I think Agentforce has some limitations, especially for domains like sales. It’s great for automating workflows, but sales conversations are a different beast. They’re unpredictable, require nuance, and often involve quick pivots. Tools designed specifically for sales—like ones that provide real-time suggestions during calls or automate post-call tasks—fill that gap much better. For example, I’ve seen tools like Graycommit focused on sales conversations. Instead of building generalized agents, they prioritize guiding sales reps in real time—suggesting questions, handling objections, and structuring calls better. The cool part? These kinds of tools don’t just stop at the conversation—they automate follow-ups, update CRMs, and even load contextual data from public sources to back up a rep’s claims during calls. In comparison, Agentforce feels broader and more customizable, which is great for internal workflows. But for teams that need hyper-focused support, especially in sales, there’s still a lot of room for specialized tools to shine. Curious what others think—has anyone here tried building sales-specific workflows with Agentforce? Or are you leaning on more specialized tools for that? Would love to hear how you are solving these challenges! I can’t help but feeling like you took my comment and put it into ChatGPT and then added some flourish with the bit about Greycommit…Why? What did you add to this conversation other than re-packaging what I said and then offering a question at the end? Yea any long answer nowaydays feel chatGPT is in it..they truely changed the game. and i felt if some startup is doing a good job at creating things definitely as a community we should talk about it..Mostly i was focused on agent force but the other startup has actually helped us in realtime calls..so i felt i need to speak about it..am curious how this AI native softwares will change the landscape..happy to hear your thoughts as well..as you have been actively involved in understanding new tools out there You didn't answer the question. Its just new naming for the same thing dude..some flows and blocks they created for agents..they work like shit now...! Lot of manual heavy lifting is needed ..default agent blocks given are of not much use..fundamentally its a hype. Great summary, would you know if prompt builder is being sold separately for record summaries and email templates ? you get that (+internal agents, fka copilot) in the Einstein for sales/service skus On your pdf example, for what it's worth I'm pretty sure that's not their technology. I did a demo with Cloud Files who does do this and they said they will be doing a partnership with Salesforce. Figures that the coolest AI thing I saw in Salesforce wasn't actually developed by Salesforce. Given their pricing model, I would assume this to be an add on and not part of any core package they're selling. Just my two cents. You might as well just buy it directly from Cloud Files. My understanding about data clouds benefit in this regard is that it does vectoring which is crucial to allowing LLMs to read unstructured data like a pdf. I’m sure data cloud is not the only option for this and honestly I’m not entirely sure I could explain what vectoring is right now lol, but it was part of their presentations on data clouds and how it enables the ability to read unstructured data.",

I did a demo with Cloud Files who does do this and they said they will be doing a partnership with Salesforce. Figures that the coolest AI thing I saw in Salesforce wasn't actually developed by Salesforce. Given their pricing model, I would assume this to be an add on and not part of any core package they're selling. Just my two cents. You might as well just buy it directly from Cloud Files. My understanding about data clouds benefit in this regard is that it does vectoring which is crucial to allowing LLMs to read unstructured data like a pdf. I’m sure data cloud is not the only option for this and honestly I’m not entirely sure I could explain what vectoring is right now lol, but it was part of their presentations on data clouds and how it enables the ability to read unstructured data.",

Pretty intuitive from the consulting/administration side of things, you can get actions built in an hour or two that can add a lot of value. Some of the key topics in the study material for the AI Specialist cert was ways to determine ROI of money spent developing actions and bots, and how to identify areas of low effort/high impact. Herein lies the problem: people think all the effort is BUILD. In the AI world it’s all about QA. How does it perform against various instructions, various models, various datasets, etc.",

      "commentBody": "Agentforce and agent-based LLM implementations like it show significant promise. The issue is that we don't yet know how well this approach will work in practice. Everyone trying Agentforce today is signing up to pay Salesforce for the privilege of joining a huge research project. It might work out great, but it might not. I've read that recent LLM based projects have a 20% success rate right now. There's a lot of subjectivity about what is considered a success, but it's clear you need to be willing to see no return on your investment if you start using Agentforce today. If you aren't very risk tolerant, I'd stay away. You don’t build products by being really smart, designing something that sounds like a great idea, having a big launch with a lot of marketing and get people to purchase it. Exactly as you said, all products are experiments but especially new ones like this that are uncharted territory, and the first attempt very rarely is useful to anyone. I can’t find any sort of review or third party write up of whether it’s actually useful for real companies. Not a good sign. And these mistakes in designing the product are often foundational, not just about changing a few screens around",

I’m a solo admin so i’m nervous to implement, but premier support has a great 1:1 workshop series and “white glove onboarding” support process.  we’re hoping to lower our cost per case as our current scripted chatbot does not have the greatest containment rate and we end up escalating to humans more often than not. hoping that it goes well. we got the $0 data cloud sku, and negotiated on pricing and what it includes on our contract. our contract is up in july so we’re using this as a 7 month test to see how well it works for us. Is it any good? Any updates?  How is your implementation going? It’s been live in prod for about a month now. There are some bugs but with the basic faq and escalation topic we have set up and limited connectivity (we’re going through replatforming right now for our order management systems) it’s still definitely better than the last scripted bot we were using. We are planning to have full integration by end of Q2 so hopefully I’ll have a better update at that point. can you explain a little more about your current use case(s)?",

      "commentBody": "We have a couple of free trial licenses of Service AI and it's legit. Salesforce has done a good job with the back end integrations (apex, flow) and tools (prompt builder, agents) and trust model. But what makes it legit is the huge advancements in the AI models like chatgpt. Few years ago this was all vaporware for Salesforce. I'm a salesforce developer for 14 years and I think this will be huge for Salesforce. And the next big in demand Salesforce job will be Salesforce AI prompt engineers. I told our Salesforce rep they should create a \"Prompt Exchange\". Just checked and www.promptexchange.com is for sale $3,595. Crap.",

      "commentBody": "I am late to the party but just want to point this out: Agentforce is supposed to boost the productivity of current customer-facing reps. i.e. Sales, Customer Support/Success. etc... Salesforce's internal sales team is huuuuge. So kind of ironic that they are now hiring 5,000 sales reps to sell agentforce instead of using their own tool and enable the current team to do more with less 😂",

      "commentBody": "The reality is Marc messed up. He did what every other company has done in the past. He acquired and resold without thinking about the data model. Anyone that is buying AgentForce today is funding salesforce to try and figure out the data model mess which is a mega-siloed integration mess.  This is why he says data cloud. The real winner is the company who created a single-data model to run your customer revenue lifecycle. This allows clean data to run through your the system which also allows you to repeat the process. The system runs automatically from flawless data that is continuously flowing with automated workflows. No-AI and No-wasted budget on shiny objects that are taking money away from your cashflow. AI is a bandaid for a big problem that it hard to start over from.  It is better to push ahead and ask your SI Consultant community to customize around what the systems can’t do.",
