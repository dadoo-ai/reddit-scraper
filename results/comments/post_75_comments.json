    "postMessage": "Hi guys i hope all of you are having a great day, not like me :(( I really need help. I am building an Experience Cloud site where the main goal is that the user (guest) can access the site through a link and book an appointment there. The issue is that my scheduling screen flow initially asks the user for their phone number (MessagingPlatformKey) and then performs a Get Record on the Messaging End User. However, every time I try to run the site as a \"guest user,\" I get the following error: \"unable to parse field as dataType could not be retrieved for the passed field: RawFieldImpl[tableName: MessagingEndUser, columnName: MessagingPlatformKey]\" I tried checking the permissions and assigned the guest user profile a permission set with read access on Messaging End User, but the object doesn’t appear as an option. I also reviewed things like field-level security and sharing settings, but the issue persists.",

              "commentBody": "Messaging User isn't what you want to use. That's specifically for the MIAW chat functionality. I also don't think User is what you want, either. I think Contact is probably the correct object where you're storing that info, especially if they are guests.\n\nHere's how I would set this up since you're running this flow for guests.\n\n1. Don't configure the flow to run as a System Admin. Set it for the lowest user access level. \n2. Create a second Auto Launched flow that has an input variable for Phone. Use the auto-launched flow to search the correct record for a matching phone number, and then use an output variable to send info back to your main flow. This might just be a boolean of true/false if found or not found, or you might need several specific variables.\n3. Add your output variable for Phone to the screen flow and any necessary input variables to receive the info back from the autolaunched flow. Take a look at this article on setting up a Screen Action to run the check. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.flow_ref_elements_screen_flow_screen_actions.htm&amp;type=5\n4. Once you verify the number and whatever else you need, continue in the screen flow with your end users.\n\nIf they need to create any records, then you should do those with auto-launched flows to maintain security with unauthenticated users.",
