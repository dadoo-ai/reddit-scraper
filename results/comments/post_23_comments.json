    "postMessage": "I'm sure there's some sub reddit that I missed, but this is the one I'm on. I have 16 years of dumb Salesforce things I've had to work around over the years, but this one I just wanted to share in case anyone comes across it. I developed a feature for my sales team to extend the capabilities for managing products on opportunities and quotes because we often have hundreds of products on each (don't ask... Working on that as well). They have called it a \" game changer\" because it allows them to search, sort, filter, bulk clone or delete products, update quantities, etc.  I used a combination of the typical screen flow, lwc data table and apex. Here's the most profound dumb thing I had to solve. Unlike the standard Edit Products button... When you change the product Quantity on any OLI guess what? It keeps the Total Price the same and adjusts the Unit Price to keep the total price the same! And this only happens if it happens from a flow or anywhere outside of the standard Edit Pro Products button. That's right. If my sales team is looking to sell a product at $100/ per unit for $100. And then up sells that to 10 products, well SFDC seems to think that I want to sell my product for $10/per unit. And they say, \"Yeah. That's what we expect.\" So I had to, as they put in their resolution to this idiotic issue, put my own automation in place to change the unit price back to what it's supposed to be. And of course that exposes us to governmor limit issues that we have to manage. Could I also put it into something asynchronous? Of course. That's not my point. I freaking shouldn't have to for this idiotic sfdc behavior. BTW...I know that if you change both the quantity and the unit price then the unit price also changes, but in a datable it's just going to update the changed column. At least that's as far as I know without going further down this ridiculous rabbit hole.",

That's why I wonder what kind of governor limits you hit.",

After your data table, you can have a Transform element to copy selected Quantities, their current UnitPrice, and OLI IDs in a separate collection, and update it in one go. Yes, it's an additional step, but not that difficult to work around.",
