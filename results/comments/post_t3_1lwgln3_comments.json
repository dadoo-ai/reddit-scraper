I didn't get to implement work summary, the task given was specific to use agentforce as a chatbot. Is the work summary better? If you're using agentforce to summarize cases, you're probably way overpaying. Work Summaries works really slick - we find it does a fantastic job of summarizing lengthy chats, and identifying the question vs. resolution in the chats too even. It just uses regular einstein tokens, versus paying for an agentforce conversation to do the same. They didn't support cases when we first rolled it out late last year, so that's our next move very soon now that cases are supported. It's not up to me, Management prepaid for agentforce for the next 3 years and now they need to show that it's not just sitting in the shelf, so it will be done using agentforce. Fyi we're not only using it for case summary but that's the one that's most visible. Would work summary be good for working with cases?",

What I do see frequently is the use of N8N with Salesforce to drive automation. We’ve implemented few workflows ourselves, and it’s been fantastic. When we tried to do the same with Agentforce, it simply didn’t work You should make a post about those workflows it would be super interesting. Not a big fan of the Astroturfing people from n8n. I haven’t heard of a single client doing this or even mentioning them. I’d use flows or apex ANY day over something like this. Would similarly be interested in the specifics of the success you’ve had with N8N! Eager to learn more I’m nearly ready to deploy an n8n workflow which takes Salesforce accounts, opens the website on the account, reads the homepage, and sets the industry value. It’s actually working remarkably well in our testing compared to traditional data vendors. Could also do the same using a Flex Prompt Template without needing the additional service. I believe you can start with Salesforce Foundations for this use case, just be careful with usage and negotiate pricing for additional credits once you have a handle on consumption. Leverage the web search data library functionality and add the Agentforce Knowledge Answers skill is another option.",

One underrated feature is the customizable agent dashboard it’s great for tracking individual performance without overwhelming the team. Definitely worth exploring! Can you tell me more about the call routing? How are you employing Agentforce there Heya, Agentforce’s call routing is great for us! It uses customer data and agent skills to route calls smartly, cutting wait times by about 15-20%. We’ve set it up via Omni-Channel Flow to prioritize urgent cases and match queries to the right team. Still fine-tuning, but it’s super efficient. What’s your setup? Interesting. We’re in the midst of exploring turning it on for various aspects. What’s it using as inputs for routing and scaling urgency? Intent or sentiment in a chatbot? Guest attributes? Or how does it determine “urgent” essentially",

If you’re here to just try and talk trash about Salesforce so your own brand is stronger you can piss right off. Otherwise if you really don’t understand then you must be a terrible, terrible PM.

No Salesforce API limitations, No Salesforce SOQL Limitations, and No Salesforce Join Limitations. Took <15 minutes from start to AI fully setup. All data stays in your AWS and is 100% private and free for 30 days. Claude produces the best reports, automated agent responses, and pricing is fantastic ( https://www.anthropic.com/pricing ). We use other AI products against the Data Lake but found that Claude as of right now produced the best quality without hallucinations. Still exploring Agentforce for AI Assistance with Sales engagement but Claude is just incredible for all other things. We are using AI to do pipeline velocity analysis. We ask Claude \"Produce me a pipeline velocity report MCL->MQL->SQL\" and below is what it produces. But can be done with any data in Salesforce. <image>",
