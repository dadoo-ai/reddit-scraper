It appears that it requires setting up Experience Cloud, but I am not sure if it's linked to SF Field Service Management objects like work orders, etc. Anyone has an idea what features are available with it?

If you want customers to log in and see things like work orders, appointments, or service requests, you’ll need to set it up using Experience Cloud. The good part is that you can expose Field Service objects (like Work Orders, Service Appointments, Assets, etc.) in the portal, so customers can track status, book/reschedule visits, or raise cases depending on how you configure it. Basically, Experience Cloud acts as the front-end, and Field Service provides the data.",
