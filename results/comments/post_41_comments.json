    "postMessage": "I graduated CS in Nov 2024 with 3.8 GPA and have been working in Salesforce ever since. I wanted to know if y’all had multiple thoughts about continuing in Salesforce or switching to fullstack / full development. I am pretty good at Salesforce and can handle everything from config to dev by my own and work on multiple projects simultaneously, but I always keep overthinking that the longer I stay the longer it will be hard to switch to other fields like AI/ML eng as I’ll have to start again. However I also know many fullstack developers who switched to Salesforce after a few years in their field. So I am stuck and don’t really know what to do and what’s the best option.\n( also I get paid $800 a month which is very low for me but is considered average in my country, so I was thinking of relocating somewhere my skills will be appreciated)",

Your skills are transferable to any tech field, and Salesforce is constantly evolving, offering growth opportunities.\n\nIf you’re passionate about AI/ML engineering, explore that path. But your Salesforce experience will give you a head start. Keep crushing it in Salesforce and learning new things. Take on challenging projects and consider taking a machine learning course.\n\nRegarding pay, $800 a month is challenging given your skills. Have you thought about remote work? With your skills, you could potentially land a remote Salesforce gig with better pay without relocating.\n\nYour Salesforce skills are valuable and will only grow with time. But don’t limit yourself to one interest. Trust your instincts, keep learning, and advocate for your worth.\n\nYou’ve got this! If you want to chat more about Salesforce career stuff, reach out.",

I switched to Salesforce development work about ten years ago and had a good run. (In the US, by the way.) But currently the market for Salesforce dev work in the US is absolutely terrible. My suggestion is to take a look at other platforms and technologies and think about what will be a good match for your skill set and demand over the next ten years. Keep your current job but figure out what technology you want to jump to next and start preparing and moving toward your next career goal. Also, don't limit your thinking to technology careers, and stay open to all kinds of opportunities and entrepreneurial possibilities. Wishing you the best of luck!",

However, if you truly want to move into AI or full-stack development and you're confident in your skills, I’d suggest learning and mastering those areas. Until you land a full-stack role, you can continue working in Salesforce to gain experience and maintain income.",

That salary does sound a bit low but I know nothing about your countries economic situation. \n\n  \nThe important thing is you have employment :) fresh out of school. If you stay on this sub a bit you will see that there is a lot of people wanting to be where you're at. So don't look back, look forward and keep learning :)",
