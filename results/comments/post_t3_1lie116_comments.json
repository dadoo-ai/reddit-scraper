    "postMessage": "Hey, I’m reaching out to those of you who’ve used AgentForce and either exposed it to customers or are considering it. After some experimentation, I noticed: Hallucinations still happen Some security is handled via system instructions , which feels problematic. So I’m curious - what do you think about AgentForce’s security infrastructure ? Can it be trusted in customer-facing use cases? How hard is it to implement safe usage patterns? Are you adding your own guardrails (like validation layers, context filtering, or audit logs)? I would love to hear from anyone building with it, especially if you’ve gone beyond the lab and opened it up to real users.",
