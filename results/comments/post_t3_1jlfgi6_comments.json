      "commentBody": "Okay so imagine if you could have a digital intern go and do stuff for you when you ask it to- that’s the vision. Examples: Help answer a case question, prepare a proposal based on opportunity and product data, or create an order on a third party OMS. Agents are NOT an LLM like raw GPT models, and they certainly aren’t ChatGPT in Salesforce. “Agents” are configurable bundles of instructions for actions an AI model can take based on the job needed. They have topics (“areas of expertise”) and actions (“things they can do”). Topics contain one or more actions, and have instructions on when a specific action is needed. When a user prompts an agent, it will create a plan of action based on what it can do, then it will do it and work with the user to accomplish the tasks. Yes, it is in its infancy, yes, it’s expensive, and yes, it is currently more vaporware than real, but it has been making strides since its first announcement. You can call agents from an API, you can create LWCs to show up as a result of an action, and you can have an agent run flows, apex, or prompts to an LLM. That’s pretty neat if we’re being honest. Why is this not higher. The actual answer that isn’t “ChatGPT in SFDC.” I think a lot of people fail to remember that a majority of Salesforce users are non-technical, so they discount the real value of these types of declarative tools. To a developer this may sound silly because they could probably build something similar with an LLM and some creative prompting, but to the rest of the ecosystem Agentforce might make a lot of sense once it’s more feature rich and slightly more affordable. The other piece is the benefit of using it across the entire infrastructure. Using data cloud to pull in the data and agent force to action on it can be pretty useful.  Much more beneficial for larger companies with multiple data sources, but SF has always kind of focused on Enteprise first and let the midmarket figure it out later. Oh dang that actually does sound pretty cool - thanks for the detailed answer! My pleasure! Best answer in the thread, shut it down, no further explanation needed. \"it is currently more vaporware than real\" This is truth. Please help! Can you explain to me is it possible to use Agentforce in place of phone reps? Can you have a live-phone agent via Agentforce? Can it handle phone calls, for instance?",

      "commentBody": "Imagine you are eating at a restaurant, and it's starts raining, and you wished your reservation had been moved inside.  Imagine Woody Harrelson sits at a different restaurant across the street laughing at you.  That's AgentForce. It solves the problem of when your mother in law is coming over and you just want to sit around in your underwear and play videogames. Oh damn, sold. Let me grab my $9M for the contract and Slalom implementation. As a Salesforce developer, I only laughed at this because I don't know any restaurant that could afford Salesforce and Agentforce with as thin as those margins are in their space. Maybe if the restaurant was owned by a giant company that had a fleet of restaurants. The commercial at Heathrow airport though is completely legit, I could see that happening. Also the Vivant demos they did are real. I use Vivant and it is very cool to see the technology in action. Someone has commented before that it's the \"booking app\" mentioned in the commercial that is supposedly using agentforce.  That is OpenTable.  But I don't think OpenTable actually moves anyone's table inside automatically if rain is predicted.  And I don't think you'd need AgentForce to do that even if they wanted to do that. Hum, that does make a lot more sense. I didn’t know that OpenTable took food preferences like the seafood dish in its platform. I thought it was just a table for x at y time kind of service. I guess the \"Agent\" is scraping that info from your restaurant reviews and previous reservations.  It does let you make special requests of the restaurant. Matthew McConaughey* Um, no.  It's Woody Harrelson sitting across the street.  Matthew is the one sitting in the rain. Just rewatched the commercial, take my upvote My condolences on having to watch it again. Oh that commercial had me so embarrassed. Like, you’re accidentally describing what would happen to you if you went to a restaurant run by AI instead of humans with sense.",

      "commentBody": "Imagine if you could connect your data in Salesforce to ChatGPT, and pay a 2,000% markup over the cost of the actual AI compute. That’s agent force. You are paying for governance, security and data privacy among other things not just AI compute. You are paying for governance, security and data privacy among other things convenience not just AI compute. Fixed that for you. I’m surprised you didn’t whip out the “but TrUst LaYEr!!”  I’m guessing you missed the announcement (that they buried) that they no longer mask data before processing it since it fucks up the output? Mind sharing that announcement? I’d love to read it. Data Masking is disabled for all the use cases related to Agentforce. The reason behind this decision is - while data masking is vital for securing customer privacy, it can hinder the contextual accuracy and relevance of outputs in certain cases—such as the planner and action workflows within Agentforce. For example, if a user asks the Einstein Agent to build a list of similar accounts, the LLM (Large Language Model) needs the actual details of the referenced account. If these details are masked, the model lacks the necessary context to identify similar accounts effectively. To enhance our approach to safeguard customer data and privacy for Agentforce Agents use cases, soon we will be offering Anthropic Sonnet LLM as an option which will be hosted within our Trusted Boundary and managed by Salesforce. With Anthropic Sonnet Model (hosted within the Salesforce Trust Boundary on Amazon Bedrock) for Agentforce use cases, Data Masking will still be disabled but the Customer data will remain within the Salesforce Trust Boundary that can reduce their security and privacy concerns. https://compliance.salesforce.com/en/documents/a006e000014OxLFAA0 Dude this is never gonna get fedRAMPed or approved for use with Health Cloud at this rate then. Thanks for the info. Thank you! That just threw a wrench in our firm I am sure. Glad I am not a part of those projects now even though they are pushing us to. I tried to log in and i got an authentication error. Where Can I access this? I got a discusion now with dev who is telling me that the data is masked for AgentForce You’ll need to talk to your AE if you can’t access compliance docs. cheeky salesforce... seems hiding things is the new trust layer... Gotta love that they keep stuff like this out in the open though: https://www.salesforce.com/blog/data-masking/ My understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, that even while data masking is gone, the prompt and it's response are not stored by the llm Provider Yes, welcome to how every corporate LLM instance works. I read that “announcement. It’s a little more nuanced than that, but not very. Still concerning if you have a lot of sensitive data. He said without the hype. It’s a 4000% markup You’re not wrong about the markup, the integration with the platform is really what you’re paying for at this point. Can you call ChatGPT directly from a flow? Sure, if you want to pull together a callout and process the response.  Can you wire that to book a reservation for you in your org? Also possible, again a bit of work to pull together. Key question - how long until someone provides installable components that connect directly with an LLM in the places where you might use an agent? Soon if it hasn’t happened already. SF hasn’t figured out the $ model yet and the product has a ways to go before it’s mature. This. Totally",

Sure, if you want to pull together a callout and process the response.  Can you wire that to book a reservation for you in your org? Also possible, again a bit of work to pull together. Key question - how long until someone provides installable components that connect directly with an LLM in the places where you might use an agent? Soon if it hasn’t happened already. SF hasn’t figured out the $ model yet and the product has a ways to go before it’s mature.",

In all of the threads on this topic I’m just waiting for someone to say “at my company we use Agentforce to do X, and the result is Y.” I have been excited about the possibilities with LLMs since ChatGPT first went public.  I still see huge potential.  But I think that for now the investment is money down the drain, unless you’re in a position for a significant investment, in which case Agentforce isn’t exactly a force multiplier (no pun intended). At my project (streaming industry ) we have implemented Agentforce which is now capable of answering questions related to contents (films, series, sports' events such as football matches, etc.) what is the value difference between this and a regular chatbot? It's like having a ChatGPT that have all the contextual information about your customer, your users (example skills, permissions, etc.) and the knowledge your company accumulates on knowledge articles (stored inside Salesforce Clouds) or outside (exemple: calling APIs to factor-in other external information (either structured or non-structored, PDFs, etc.) Also, an Agentforce can work without human intervention and perform repetitive tasks such as sending info by email to a customer based on a set of transcribed calls or based on a pattern. It is becoming... amazing. Agentforce could, for instance, help you to make decisions by suggesting for example a McDonald's restaurant to order food to suppliers based on the prediction of demand which in turn can be based in contextual information such as the weather, the location of the restaurant, the number of people walking in front of the door, or on the scheduled of important football matches or based on whether children go to school or not based on bank holidays or exams \"season\"... Agentforce can work for employees or for customers customers or for anyone needing help from a bot with privileged information. I hope this helps.",

      "commentBody": "I like to describe it as the equivalent of ChatGPT in Salesforce - that has access to the CRM’s data. Is it groundbreaking and special (like the kool-aid suggests 😅)? In my opinion, no. But the advantage is that it makes AI more accessible to organisations - they don’t have to manage integrations, a bunch of security/masking rules built in, and I believe for big organisations they’d be less governance to adopt. However… this ease of accessibility comes with a cost $$ Not so much on the masking thing: Data Masking is disabled for all the use cases related to Agentforce. The reason behind this decision is - while data masking is vital for securing customer privacy, it can hinder the contextual accuracy and relevance of outputs in certain cases—such as the planner and action workflows within Agentforce. For example, if a user asks the Einstein Agent to build a list of similar accounts, the LLM (Large Language Model) needs the actual details of the referenced account. If these details are masked, the model lacks the necessary context to identify similar accounts effectively. To enhance our approach to safeguard customer data and privacy for Agentforce Agents use cases, soon we will be offering Anthropic Sonnet LLM as an option which will be hosted within our Trusted Boundary and managed by Salesforce. With Anthropic Sonnet Model (hosted within the Salesforce Trust Boundary on Amazon Bedrock) for Agentforce use cases, Data Masking will still be disabled but the Customer data will remain within the Salesforce Trust Boundary that can reduce their security and privacy concerns. https://compliance.salesforce.com/en/documents/a006e000014OxLFAA0 I mean, his statement is factual.  You don't have to consider a bunch of security / masking since there isn't any.  :) Sick! Good to know that SFDC’s whole thing about “privacy, data masking, and security” went out the door with Agentforce. I’m really curious to see if it’s even compatible with orgs that use a ton of data masking for sensitive data/PII (I’m thinking it’s a no for that) even CRM data is somewhat limited I think?

I will say that use cases surrounding Knowledge do seem promising to me. There are two things that I think that Agentforce can do well and think should be considered. 1) it has the ability to call flows and apex.  If configured properly, most of the manual work that is done by end users could be automated via natural language commands.  The biggest issue with this is building a critical mass of actions so it doesn't just end up being a random automation of a few tasks.  If you can create automation for most things, Agentforce will be a efficiency maker.  Licenses are expensive, but so are many hours. 2) Use cases around ai agents are powerful.  Much of customer service involves people calling companies knowing exactly what needs to be done.  In these cases (where creative problem solving is not required), ai agents will be able to more quickly and efficiently get customers the information they need as well as potentially automating basic actions (e.g. triggering actions related to a return). Is Salesforce intentionally holding corporate wallets hostage by gatekeeping open source AI for being effectively used in Salesforce?  I honestly don't know.  Can Agentforce be great?  Sure, but I haven't seen any real-world implementations that have wowed me.  Still, I am cautiously optimistic that Agentforce has plenty of potential to be great.",

That said, with all the AI stuff happening, I can see how this whole revolution/disruption/chaos is going to seriously reshape SaaS forever. I’m genuinely trying to keep up with it all—but I’m also wondering: are these new AgentForce badges and certs actually worth the time? Has anyone looked into them or gone through the process?",
