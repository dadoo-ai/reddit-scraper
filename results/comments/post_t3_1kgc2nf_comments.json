You have to do a rehearsal with an employee ahead of time and they pay attention and give you feedback. If your rehearsal was on the proposed topic and you switched at the conference, the audience will be upset you wasted their time and you will get very negative scores and not be invited to speak again. There could be worse repercussions if the topic was anti-Salesforce (kicked out of partner program, employer notified, etc) There may be people who want to hear the real talk you want to give, but they won't be in the audience, since your lie will be listed in the agenda instead. If you're passionate about a topic and want to speak at DF, you're going to have to either take the risk of submitting it as is or figure out how to connect it to AgentForce.",
