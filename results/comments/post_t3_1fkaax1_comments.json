    "postMessage": "Any comments in Salesforce’s big Agentforce announcement from yesterday? Their announcement and website don’t seem to have enough details to explain which use cases are enabled/impacted, besides “answering customer inquiries and qualifying sales leads”.  Yesterday, at DreamForce, Marc said that any attendee can ask the “agent” for the schedule. Is it me or does that sound a bit underwhelming? Are these \"agents\" just a fancy \"chatbot\" or am I being too cynical?",

      "commentBody": "So agents can have lists of instructions that are all based on natural language \"do x, don't do y\" etc. They can also have actions they can perform such as launch a flow, summarize information from an unstructured data source like product manuals, case history, knowledge articles, etc, or even more complex things like provide answers from prompts based on customer data such as \"is my product still covered under warranty?\" They can be deployed to any channel, sms, Web, Mobile, social, they're ridiculously easy to build, and they aren't on rails like Einstein chat bots. They will most likely be used for low hanging fruit use cases like case deflection but I imagine they will soon be used to help navigate more complex scenarios. Imagine you could use an agent to take hybrid data like your college course history, gpa, and unstructured data like your entrance essay and then retrieve recommendations for scholarships to apply to. At Dreamforce they're using agents to assist with finding sessions. You might look at something like that and say \"big deal\" but using language is so incredibly powerful and useful for people with disabilities and vision impairments. Game changing. Is this the same as Einstein Copilot? Total rebrand of it. Yes. Yes",

      "commentBody": "Yes and no. Chat bot is a good analogy but that’s over simplifying it. Similar to calling ChatGPT just a chat bot. The administration is also very smooth. Being able to create different Agents. Give them specific capabilities and monitoring their performance (and even replaying their recordings) with customers. You can give different chatbots their own directions, like having a VIP-only chat bot that has more capability. All the directions to the agents are abstracted too - Only simple instructions needed to allow it to make requests to external systems rather than scripted “customer press 1, then 2, then 5 to get order details” The only VIP function that I want is the ability to get a human on the line. Ngl, I’m at DF and it’s all I’m thinking - this is great, but the Achilles heel of this whole thing is that people don’t want to use bots, they want to talk to real people. The use of bots in customer-facing situations is just a clearly telegraphed signal that a company doesn’t care about irritating their customers, and are pinching pennies while eliminating human workers. Counterpoint: we o ly want humans because bots today are inadequate. If we could get our simple issues sorted quickly, we wouldn't care. Edit:. Also at DF (waiting for bag check) and I think the consumption-based billing will be diffcult It will likely be expensive af and extremely convoluted billing. However, customer success will usually work with you to improve practices, reduce billing, and pause/delay - Probably because they won’t have a way to prove the bill yet I never want to talk to a person. I want my problem solved. I always prefer good self-service over a live agent. But since almost all bot-enabled self-service today is crappy, I almost always prefer a live agent over a chat bot. If chat bots improved enough, however, that sentiment would change. My bet is that in 5 years people will prefer to talk with bots (at least in companies with mature architectures) than with customer support people. I disagree with this. You can't hold bots accountable the same way you do people. Unless corporations are willing to give bots privileges similar to managers, that just won't happen. You really don’t understand the service desk industry if you think those individuals are accountable. If the bot is not performing, you get transferred to a person. People will not disappear. Not to mention there are people managing/configuring the bots. Those are the ones accountable, the bot is just a tool. [deleted] If it improves measurable inefficiencies in your sales/service workflow and achieves a positive ROI, there is a point. Eventually they will, because of cost. You need to pay $2 per agentforce transaction, why would anybody pay for it if not to reduce agents or to reduce time per transaction which in turn reduces need for new agent hiring. Looks like you're in software sales. I think we re talking about different things. Many people, especially agents, will be made redundant. There will always be people managing the process, but as many as before obv. I suspect the new roles will also be fewer but also better paid. Ah okay I see what you're saying, glad we agree on - some people will disappear. Because Salesforce Sales guys keep saying, we're not here to replace people, not sure how they want people to believe that. Totally totally agree. I’d far rather a competent chatbot that can actually resolve issues directly, than any interaction with salesforce first line support. Think about feature activation requests, not being asked for a screen share session, it just getting done The thing is that some of these things are hid behind a support agent so they can do additional checks and reviews. If we're saying specific support pools (SF T1 obviously included) are redundant because of their uselessness, that's a great case for replacing with Agents. In other cases it's not just about \"fetch data and compile\", there's notions of experience, adaptability, etc which are simply... not possible to do due to the amount of data required. I mean it's possible but not realistically. As per always, technological advances have a tendency to remove the ground floor, but the rest will still exist. You’re assuming that the human staff have the required experience and skill. My encounters with SF support haven’t given me that impression. I generally have to teach them the relevant platform functionality in order to get them to understand it not working so they will then escalate to someone who has a clue. That first level could easily be replaced by a chat bot. But I’d prefer it to be replaced by someone competent initially. I mean, they’ve forced onto so many screenshares over the last few years, they should have sufficient training data by now! I do not want to talk to a person if it’s not needed. I ask ChatGPT stuff all the time. If I could have a company or product specific version of that with the option to escalate to a person I’d pick it every time. Fair point. But people said the same thing about messaging. Gen Z loves to msg instead of talking to real person. But what if you had something that spoke like a human and get you immediate answers? The thing most hate about these robo service systems is they’re scripted, slow, can’t be interrupted, and tedious. Yes, these bots will have clear rules set by business on what they can and can’t do, but having conversations with them is very much human-like. If it’s not giving you the right info, interrupt and clarify. Don’t knock it till you try it. I've been giving this further thought, actually. I have to concede that I probably would prefer working with a good, efficient bot that quickly solved my problem with no hassle than waiting for and dealing with a person. Kinda like I'd rather brainstorm with Claude AI than bother my coworkers much of the time. Claude is a little different, though, and I haven't yet seen a really good AI agent that I'd let run in the wild, personally. So I guess sure, IF it's really good, I'm here for it, otherwise I'm getting frustrated much more quickly than I would dealing with a person and feeling like the company I'm dealing with doesn't value me. I think this technology is finally there and I am interested to see whether the product team will under or overdeliver. It sounds like they’ve rolled it out to customers in beta and are now ready to roll it out broadly. The guiderails are what will make a big difference to me since we’ve all seen the horror stories of customers who get homegrown chatbots to misbehave. The sales agent use case will be big especially if part of it uses existing sales cadence features… VPs would go for this if it meant hiring even 10-20% fewer sales team members as they grow their team or help them make more sales.",

In other cases it's not just about \"fetch data and compile\", there's notions of experience, adaptability, etc which are simply... not possible to do due to the amount of data required. I mean it's possible but not realistically. As per always, technological advances have a tendency to remove the ground floor, but the rest will still exist. You’re assuming that the human staff have the required experience and skill. My encounters with SF support haven’t given me that impression. I generally have to teach them the relevant platform functionality in order to get them to understand it not working so they will then escalate to someone who has a clue. That first level could easily be replaced by a chat bot. But I’d prefer it to be replaced by someone competent initially. I mean, they’ve forced onto so many screenshares over the last few years, they should have sufficient training data by now!",

You really don’t understand the service desk industry if you think those individuals are accountable. If the bot is not performing, you get transferred to a person. People will not disappear. Not to mention there are people managing/configuring the bots. Those are the ones accountable, the bot is just a tool.

Looks like you're in software sales. I think we re talking about different things. Many people, especially agents, will be made redundant. There will always be people managing the process, but as many as before obv. I suspect the new roles will also be fewer but also better paid.

Dabbling in both industries, I just don't see the value in companies locking their AI flows / pipelines in their CRM suite in priperitory format with steep licensing. In my opinion it should be in a seperate centralized system and utilizing data and functions in CRM and other human UI.",
