    "postMessage": "Hey everyone, I’m trying to get hands-on with Agentforce in Salesforce, but I’m running into a wall. I’ve found Trailheads that provide temporary access, but I haven’t been able to find a way to gain a free org to experiment with beyond that. In our Salesforce org, we have a service agent we can tinker with, but that’s about it—there’s no other capability available to explore or build on. For those of you who have gotten good at using Agentforce, how did you manage it? Is there a way to get free orgs or sandbox access to fully test and build with it? Appreciate any advice!",

AI is a consumption model - Salesforce has to pay the various AI LLMs to use their services, so these trial orgs are likely costing them significant money. But, no trial org, no learning the platform in any useful way. I work for a global SI, and we've been having nothing but problems getting AI capabilities in a permanent fashion because the environments need the licenses and there's a ton of hoops to jump through to get it. I’m going though this exact issue right now. We’ve been trying to provision agentforce in our partner org since December and have been directed down so many different paths and signed various $0 contracts but still do not have access to agentforce .",

I realize you pay after those 1K conversations. That’s what I currently have access to, but it’s still very limited in terms of capability. I often see all sorts of capability but am finding myself wondering how and when I can begin to try and implement it. What you mentioned, at least for me and to my knowledge, only gives access to a basic service agent capability which doesn’t fit the need we have I believe it gives you full access to AF capabilites; however, only 1K conversations.  It also gives you Data Cloud.  I think AF is very complex, regardless of what SF is saying, & people are struggling with self implementation. The only agent option I have to select is service agent etc. is that what full access gives us right now? Yes, I believe so.  I believe that's the only Agent that is GA.  The most common uses might be: \"Where is my order\" \"I need to change my order\" \"What is your return policy\" \"do you do exchanges\" \"Where is your closest store\" Things like that. Service agents can have custom actions and topics added to do other things besides the out of the box defaults.",

      "commentBody": "So I just did a deep dive into what we might be getting from the foundations sku and trying to understand what using the copilot agent (now called Agentforce lol) would actually be billed as and this is basically what I’ve found. Using the Copilot/Agentforce agent for internal users consumes Einstein Requests, which work like this: “Einstein Request usage is calculated for each API call made through the LLM gateway to a Large Language Model (LLM). Consumption calculations involve:\n    • The usage type multiplier associated with the type of LLM used, as described in the Einstein Generative AI Rate Card.\n    • The API call size factor, which is the combined size of the prompt and the LLM-generated response, in words, divided by 1,500, and then rounded up to the next integer. There are no fractional API call size factors.\nSo, for example, if an API call of 3,000 words uses an LLM with a usage type multiplier of 10, it consumes 20 Einstein Requests. The rate card gives these consumption examples:\nConsumption examples:● An API call of the Starter usage type with 750 words will consume 7 Einstein Requests● An API call of the Standard usage type with 3,250 words will consume 30 Einstein Requests. So if only 25% of our users (425) were to use to copilot, and lets say each user only made 2 requests a day that averaged 500 words at the Standard multiplier (10), that would be 8500 requests each day. Spread out over 250 business days in the year (included 2 weeks off), that would be 2,125,000 requests. Which is just a tad more than the 200,000 that comes with the Foundation SKU. You will probably blow past your alotted requests during testing and then find out once you give it to users you owe salesforce a bunch of fucking money Edit: sorry for the formatting I copied and pasted some of this stuff from their website and trailhead.",
