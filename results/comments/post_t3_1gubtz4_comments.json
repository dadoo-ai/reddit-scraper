      "commentBody": "Pricing, packaging and consumption.  There are many flavors of Agentforce and the UX for them is different.  We have seen the chatbots which are really cool but there are also things like Tableau Agent which is a totally different experience and no one is clear on how consumption works.  At the end of the day all of the Agentforce features are driving consumption off of Data Cloud and there is not a lot of clarity on what a \"credit\" it or how many of them are consumed for the various types of operations.  It makes companies wary of leveraging Agentforce if they have no idea how to forcast their usage. EDIT:  If Salesforce can figure out how to effectively package Agentforce so that companies can understand what they will be paying for then I think they will take off like a rocket.",

Internal politics is a driving factor for the success of any product, and it is fair to say that Salesforce is betting the farm on Agentforce. It really is a question of how well Salesforce can execute in comparison to a lot of competitors investing heavily in this space. Data Cloud would provide the raw data at an enterprise level to put Salesforce at the center and thereby make Agentforce the natural choice. Hard to tell at this early point.",

My company spends just over $20 million per year on Salesforce, and we pay 12-30% of the list price for our various licenses, with our highest volume license at 13% list price.

Even at my last company with just over $1 million annual spend, I doubt it would be over $1 per conversation. I agree but you guys are existing customers.

It seems tone deaf TBH. If youâ€™ve spent any time at all around Salesforce, youâ€™ve likely heard horror stories about bad implementations. This type of thing tends to leave a bad taste in oneâ€™s mouth for a long time. The cautionary tales circulate when peers ask around. B2B SaaS is coming out of the growth at all costs era and still trying to untangle and reconcile a bloated tech stack. IT and ops are focused on simplifying the complexâ€”not adding on.",

      "commentBody": "While Salesforce's Agentforce is a promising development, there are a few potential challenges that could hinder its widespread adoption: 1. AI Model Limitations: Data Quality and Bias: AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased, the AI's output will be biased as well. Complexity of Real-World Interactions: Real-world interactions can be complex and nuanced, which can be challenging for AI models to fully understand and respond to. 2. User Adoption and Resistance: Fear of Job Displacement: Employees may be hesitant to adopt AI tools, fearing job loss or reduced roles. Steep Learning Curve: Using new AI tools can require significant training and adaptation. 3. Ethical Considerations: Privacy Concerns: As AI agents process more personal data, concerns about privacy and security will need to be addressed. Ethical Implications: AI can be used for both good and bad. It's important to ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly. 4. Technical Challenges: Integration with Existing Systems: Integrating Agentforce with existing systems and workflows can be complex. Scalability: As the number of AI agents increases, ensuring scalability and performance can be challenging. 5. Competitive Landscape: Rapidly Evolving AI Landscape: The AI landscape is constantly evolving, and competitors may introduce new and innovative solutions. Pricing and Licensing Models: The pricing and licensing models for Agentforce need to be competitive and attractive to customers.",
