    "postMessage": "It's that time of the year again when my employer is asking me to take another Salesforce certification. While studying for the PD1 exam using FoF's website, I got so frustrated with their clunky user experience that I built my own platform for building and running exams: Cert++ ! All it has right now is an Admin exam that and AI lovingly clanked out which I personally reviewed for accuracy. Iâ€™d love for some people to try using it and give feedback, especially if youâ€™re currently studying for the Admin exam or just recently passed it. Up next for me will probably be developing some PD1 exams since the whole reason I took this detour to code up a website was that I wanted a better way to study for the PD1 exam.",
