    "postMessage": "Hi all, I was just trying to raise a case with Salesforce support and it seems like now when you go to the contact support page the only option you have is to use agentforce, then when you try to use agentforce it just doesn't respond I was just curious if this is the case for other people as well or is it just us? They are a multi-billion dollar company and there just isn't a way to raise a case with them? There used to be a way you could create a case directly if you clicked around a bit but they seem to have taken that away",

Create your case with basic details using the enforced Agentforce flow (I hate this, it doesn't let you format your message with line breaks or anything, and misses half the options to specify a sandbox or add collaborators) Once created, you can click \"Clone\" on that case, and this presents you with the proper create-case form you used to use. Once you create your new case, you can Close the Agentforce-created one.",

However the agent ended up routing me to a human who took a few extra questions to just confirm the steps advised in the help doc. No waiting, but the agent definitely behaved more like a chat bot. \n- niche omniscript permission issue\n- premier support customer (no create a case button available)\n- human CS ended up sending me a knowledge article that had references to the error I provided I‚Äôm slightly indifferent to their desire to implement the process, but I don‚Äôt like MB‚Äôs thought train of replacing level 1 support with agents. If anything, agents should be used to support managerial tasks that take up too much time that can free up a manager to either be a good effective mentor or end up being DQ‚Äôd.",
