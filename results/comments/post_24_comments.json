      "commentBody": "Nice kickoff for a series. Inspector and Data Loader are two of those tools most admins rely on early, and it’s good you’re framing the “why” behind data management, not just the “how”\n\nThe hardest part I’ve seen in orgs isn’t the extract/load itself but putting discipline around field mappings, audit logs, and rollback plans.\n\nCurious if in later videos you’ll cover strategies for validating changes at scale (like staging before prod) or handling edge cases with large volumes?\n\nOn the sync side, some teams even lean on a platform like Stacksync to keep Salesforce data instantly aligned across systems so they don’t need to rerun heavy loads as often.",

I think it’s great that you pointed out the exact pain points I often see companies go through as well.  \n  \nWe do cover some validation within the series, along with rollback plans and data backup. I will not that this series is more beginner-friendly, but those are excellent points to include in future videos.",
