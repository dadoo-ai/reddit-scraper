      "commentBody": "Watch Salesforce pull a “salesforce function” pricing model and completely eliminate any interest in the product. There’s a level where the products are so expensive that only the largest companies can afford it, which happen to be the companies with enough engineers to build their own versions of those products for penny’s on the dollar. If it's anything like existing einstein products it seems all credit based. It's actually moronic. The example of functions is a good one, in that SForce was basically reselling AWS Lambda functions. Once customers moved to AWS via HyperForce and figured out they can call Lambdas directly for practically free, interest went away. Similarly, SForce is now reselling OpenAI and AWS Bedrock hosted AI models as their own. Maybe history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Smart people will figure this out. I heard Benioff say in some presentation that Salesforce was using their own models. To say I’m skeptical would be a massive fucking understatement. Salesforce pricing in general is becoming absolutely ridiculous. I have honestly no idea how businesses still set-up Salesforce these days with the list prices of the licenses By paying 20% of the list price (my company's average discount, with over $25 million annual Salesforce spend). I'd be surprised if there are any companies paying list price. I haven't worked with small companies with less than 100 licenses for a decade, but back then even companies with a dozen licenses didn't pay list price. This",

      "commentBody": "I don't know if there are answers to it, haven't been chasing the info myself. I heard some stupid thing like $2 per conversation but... that doesn't make a lot of sense. Heard that rumor as well. That pricing is insane, and will drive us towards a DIY setup I currently have a DIY setup and it costs around $.10-.20 per conversion. What you don’t get with a DIY setup is zero retention and OOTB PII masking though. Most enterprise customers will require that Yeah it has taken a lot of work to get the setup I have right now. We have pii masking and some other nice features, but they are all custom built in house. If it took you a lot of work to get there, you probably aren't paying $0.10-0.20 per conversation. The cost of building features like PII masking must be factored in, and for a small company only fielding 200k support calls per year even a 5-man dev team costing $1M annually adds $5 per conversation in costs. I believe enterprises fielding 50 million support interactions per year are going to be looking for closer to $0.25 per conversation. And they may get that big of a discount. But for a company with 10-20 support agents it won't be worth the R&D to build it themselves. Those will be the companies paying closer to $2 per conversation. Yeah definitely have to look at the numbers. With the point I’m at now that everything is built the upkeep is somewhat minimal and we already had a team that could upkeep it. We have 100+ agent with a good volume of cases coming in. Definitely worth it in our case compared to the cost for resolution on an agent handled case. I got shit on earlier for saying a DIY would be infinitely cheaper.  But anyone with any knowledge would know that. Oh yeah it is definitely way cheaper, but you also have to make sure you have the expertise to upkeep it. But like, you also need insane expertise to setup agentforce as well, especially since it involves datacloud setup, maintenance and configuration. It's nowhere near clicks not code like they keep parroting. It doesn't require Data Cloud unless you want to use RAG. DIY is only cheaper for the cost center paying for the software. It's not cheaper for the company. The cost center is only focused on what they need to pay externally for the software. The company is focused on what it costs to build and support it which includes salaries, systems, etc. You got shit on because you don’t know what you’re talking about Username checks out Lol considering I've been a consultant for over 10 years I likely know more than you. That's what's on the website... I'm honestly surprised they had any price listed during df The figure is based on average conversation length. Because it is consumption based, longer conversations will require more tokens for LLM requests. So the idea is that average of all conversations converge at roughly $2 worth of tokens per conversation. A \"conversation\" lasts 24 hours though for what it's worth. For non verified channels maybe but the consumption is based on turns in the communication not the amount of time the messaging session is active. You’re not consuming credits when the end user isn’t actively engaged and sending messages.",

      "commentBody": "If your organization is implementing ChatBots, Agents or AI Assistants... please read the fine print. 80% of software vendors most likely are using OpenAI GPT4 on the backend (including Salesforce). You are ultimately evaluating the \"value-add\" of the middleware when buying or implementing an AI solution today. Negotiate prices based on actual AI-token consumption plus the value-add, and determine where the security is actually managed. For GPT4-backed services, ask for and require use of your own OpenAI API key in all AI integrations so you can directly track actual consumption and audit security access. Treat OpenAI like any other Mulesoft, Zapier, Data Cloud integration where you manage, and pay for, the service being consumed. The LLM is just another data source in your IT portfolio. You will reuse this OpenAI account with many other services. Ensure access to Agent audit log trails are included in the price (Salesforce charges separately for logs). Note that the Salesforce trust layer is no longer enabled. Do not pay for so called \"security\" features that are not used. Verify that native GPT4 moderation and data retention policies are applicable (default=yes when using OpenAI API). <image> From https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_einstein_copilot_topics.htm&release=252&type=5 Data Masking is one component of the Einstein Trust Layer - that is the part that has been disabled. Toxicity Detection, Zero retention, Audit, etc all remain in place: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.generative_ai_trust_layer.htm&language=en_US&type=5 Not according to the latest fine print. Data retention is dependent on OpenAI T&Cs and DPA. Toxicity is largely solved by OAI moderation and can be enabled/disabled in prompts. No middleware needed. In fact, toxicity steering is now a leading cause of hallucination. Salesforce only guarantees \"in transit encryption\" use of SSL (which is required by every API client anyways). e.g. Trust Cloud = \"Markitecture\". And I'm guessing the reason OpenAI had zero presence at DF was due to brand issues;  misrepresentations about OpenAI capabilities and Salesforce's \"trust us\" positioning. https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2024/09/18/openai-dreamforce-salesforce.html Interesting. Can you link to the fine print to which you refer where it differs from the help article above regarding zero retention? Because what you highlighted in yellow in your screen shot indicated zero retention is still in place? Thanks. I would also love to see a copy of that.",

Salesforce Ben had an article saying it will be $2 per conversation or something ridiculous like that. Finally, the audit logs are saved in data cloud not core platform, so if you want logging you have to also pay for some amount of data cloud. What that looks like I have no idea. Honestly, the tech is kinda interesting but I don't see the business case at these prices. I've played with it quite a bit and even got the AI specialist cert. So if a client wants it, I can do it. I just have a hard time believing anyone will jump at this functionality for the prices Salesforce is charging. Datacloud is a money pit so this product sounds DOA for most customers. But included as part of foundations - so maybe not DOA? Yea at very low limits lol. You'll hit your max and then need to pay for more credits easily",

Even the AI stuff that's already included in UE+ is all mostly token based. So at best, Agentforce does get included and just consumes a larger amount of tokens than something like, say, reply recommendations or work summaries do. Our AE seemed to indicate it will be $2 per chat and not included in UE+ when we had a call the other week to ask about it more. Nobody on the call seemed to know what the cost of buying more tokens would be - IIRC each UE+ license came with 25k tokens.",
