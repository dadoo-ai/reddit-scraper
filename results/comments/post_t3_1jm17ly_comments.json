      "commentBody": "I would also like to throw my hat in the ring of saying I appreciate this approach. As someone who attended Agentforce world tour in November and learned the salesforce pre-baked, pre-packaged use cases that seem to work great, I’ve recently gotten foundations enabled in my org and seem to be unable to get the copilot agent (now called Agentforce) to be able to do a simple query of biggest opportunities in my org. I had no problem in the test environment. I’m sitting here wondering if the promised product in demos and trailheads can’t actually be what is being shipped to customers. I have enabled the copilot, setup agent, and the Einstein generative flow builder, formula builder, flow summarizer. Not a single tool has performed even the most basic action without an error. The copilot does not return the same records I see on a report based on the exact same filters in my prompt (I.e. show me the biggest closed won opportunities for X product line by amount). The setup agent has not been able to complete a single request (what permissions does X user have on the Lead object for field Y) The formula builder has been unable to produce a correct formula. The flow builder has failed at even the most basic prompt, even using the suggested prompt from\nSalesforce like “create a screenflow where then running user can select a contact that they own to send an email”. They all just fail or return incorrect results. I would love to pay someone to help me understand what we’re missing. It might even be more than a $25 amazon gift card. Edit: just to add I realize I didn’t address my experience with the flow summarizer. It has only worked on flows with less than 5 components. Which makes me wonder…what the hell is the point then? That is such a ridiculous amount of work and infrastructure to deal with, all to generate that which is available to users today at nearly the speed of thought.",
