    "postMessage": "Hi, I am trying to retrieve a custom object with the name of the object in the flow. Then from there I am getting all the lines of the second object (there is 2) from the parent object. I have my input variable as the name of the first object and I have my output variable as both product name in a text variable from my second object that pass trough a loop. When I debug the flow, I have my input and my output in the text variable. I added this to a topic action in agent builder. When I debugg it, it just doesn't work. It can't find an output and only find the input (From the chat I have with the agent). Everything is set up correctly but I get this error : UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION . An error occurred when executing a flow interview. I have been trying for 4 hours to figure out what the hell is going on. Flow are pretty simple to me.....",

Is there something else I need to do ? I can't find anything online. It was missing an unrelated permission from an assignments later in the flow but in the debugg it was not showing it properly, anyways thanks ! Make sure your running user had access to the flow and any objects. Both the agent user and running user will need correct permissions",
