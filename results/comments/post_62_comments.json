    "postTitle": "Struggling with Salesforce Scorecard ‚Äì Lead vs Opportunity Data, Manual Queries, and Error-Prone Excel",
    "postMessage": "We recently built a Sales & Marketing Scorecard in Salesforce to track MQLs, SQLs, pipeline and conversions. Our challenge is that we have been told we cannot combine the lead and opportunity objects natively in salesforce. Cross-sell leads are being created directly as Opportunities instead of Leads. We stamp these with a custom MQL timestamp to make them visible in reporting. So if I wanted to get all of what we are considering MQLs then I would need all of the rows with an MQL stamp on the leads table plus all of the rows on the Opportunity tables with and MQL timestamp that did not convert from a lead.  Additionally, Some sales opportunities don‚Äôt originate from a Lead at all, which breaks the native lead to opportunity conversion path. As a result, we‚Äôre forced to manually combine and de-duplicate the Lead and Opportunity tables outside Salesforce. Additionally, we have undergone tons of restructuring and changing how we want to label products so my team is determining the product field by looking at 5 different fields plus doing a lookup üò≠ My current frustration is that we run these queries 3 times per week. Each run takes hours due to the complexity of the joins and we still rely on manual Excel formulas to patch logic together, which is not only painful but also highly error prone. And at this point, the process has become the bane of my existence. There has seriously got to be a better way. I am about to go on a campaign for improving data quality, so ensuring that we have a unified field for the segmentation, product, etc to eliminate the multiple fields plus doing look-ups. But all of my research has gotten me no where when it comes to trying to find a way to get this scorecard into salesforce so the data is live and can be drilled into. Have you run into the same issue of combining Leads  and Opportunities for marketing and sales reporting? Any ideas or resources that would help me out?",

      "commentBody": "I can see that mql tracking, integration, de-duplication outside Salesforce, cleaning of data and dashboard monitor as few desired features. \n\nAll these can be done natively in CRM Analytics. CRM Analytics in Salesforce allows you to sync Lead and Opportunity objects into datasets, then use Data Prep recipes to filter for MQL timestamps, exclude converted leads from Opportunities, and append the results into a unified dataset for comprehensive MQL tracking. Recipes enable custom transformations, such as deriving a unified product field from multiple fields via formulas, eliminating manual lookups and reducing errors from Excel. De-duplication can be handled within recipes using aggregate or dedupe nodes, ensuring clean data without external manual processes. Schedule recipes and data syncs to run automatically (e.g., multiple times weekly), providing live, up-to-date data in dashboards without hours of querying. Build interactive lenses and dashboards on the unified dataset for drill-down capabilities, supporting your data quality campaign by centralizing segmentation and reporting natively in Salesforce.\n\nFor context, processing billions of data rows with transformations typically takes about 15-20 minutes. It all depends on optimization of recipes and datasets",

I had chatted with our salesforce admin this morning and inquired about the recipes and datasets and they were going to go research them and see if we want to add them to the roadmap. I will definitely push for this to happen knowing it will be able to meet our use case. I appreciate you taking the time to respond!!",

      "commentBody": "Salesforce doesn‚Äôt natively let you join Leads and Opportunities in one report, which is why you‚Äôre running into issues. A common fix is to create a custom ‚Äúunified‚Äù object and push both Leads and Opps with MQL stamps into it via Flow, Apex, or ETL. Joined reports are another option, though they‚Äôre limited. If you need more flexibility, sending data to a BI tool or data warehouse is often the cleanest approach. That said, the biggest step forward will be standardizing your MQL logic and product fields first once those are consistent, reporting becomes much simpler.",

          "commentBody": "It would work, but duplicating every single lead and opp into another object just for reporting is overkill\n\nData cloud can be leveraged here to unify data and report, especially since Salesforce just GA‚Äôd their Salesforce core connectors for free (I.e CRM data to data cloud doesn‚Äôt consume credits)\n\nA true BI / analytics tool (tab, CRMA) would also solve this readily and in a more scalable approach, as this is really more of a use case that goes above and beyond native SF reporting",
