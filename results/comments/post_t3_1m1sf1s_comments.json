I've made FAQ agents, intake agents, enrollment agents, etc. www.seefoodie.com is powered by Agentforce. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX1uofnsWNQ - This is a straightforward multimodal agent you can build via prompt templates. They even give you the prompt template. Not to be a jerk but none of those agents move the meter on revenue/profits. ServiceNow walked me through their AI and I kept stopping them like show me something that differentiates them from the pack or moves the chain on revenue. Even if we could replace level 0/1 support who cares. That’s not much $$$ at the end of the day. That's my take. Still waiting for something that moves the needle. Chat support bots seem to be the best ROI at the moment... Segmentation using plain language, campaign builds, web lead agents and many more saving a huge amount of time and delivering revenue generating activities. But all of that was already automated for us, at least to an extent. I see your point though, probably much lower barrier to do it with AI Very interesting take. I have been looking for (hunting for) high-impact AgentForce use cases. Coming up empty handed so far :( Seefoodie is cool, what’s it hosted on? Are you paying $2 each time someone uploads a menu? This is not my site. And just FYI - Flex Credits are now in place of the old Conversation model. https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/05/15/agentforce-flexible-pricing-news/",

So far no one uses the functionality. We have already had automated updates and such for years. Also regarding reps they have had a tool custom that hits the API gateway and pulls everything into a single view instantly. Built before I started but very nice and well architected.
