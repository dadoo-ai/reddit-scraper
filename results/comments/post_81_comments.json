    "postMessage": "Hi All, Our team is planning to switch from Pardot to Mailchimp for marketing campaigns. I came across two integration apps on the AppExchange – Mailchimp for Salesforce (MC4SF) and ChimpConnect . While searching on Google, I also found one company called Dean Infotech offering Mailchimp integration. Has anyone used any of these options? Which one would you recommend in terms of features, ease of use, and reliability? Thanks",
