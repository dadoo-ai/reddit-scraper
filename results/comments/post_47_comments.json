If the email does have, it should be populated on the related contact in case it’s empty.\nI found CTK but looks like it doesn’t match our criteria. Maybe you can recommend something.\nThank you!",

You will have to parse the response to get out the values. Use the || as the delimiter and a formula to sort it all out.\n\nProbably one of the true use case for AI that I have come across. We did something similar to extract relevant information from an email. Worked well, IMO.",

      "commentBody": "Man I don’t know why “AI” has to be involved and I love ai, but there’s literally native functionality to use an EmailService and it gives you an email and you supply it a class.  \n\nThe InboundEmailHandler will give you access to the message bodies and you can do the needful.  Don’t reinvent the wheel and just google apex regex phone number, and it’s up to you what you do with it.  You’d probably be collecting up the emails and senders and querying for them and then updating those ID matches in the Phone field (or MobilePhone or there are a few)\n\nAI should not be used to do a string check like that because you get charged per token on that stuff and I still don’t know what a Levinshtein is (jk but that’s more non “AI” apex)… I am kinda fried and don’t remember the exact terms but if it’s something deterministic and doesn’t need inferred from natural language it breaks down, you can slice and dice some stuff up in apex",
