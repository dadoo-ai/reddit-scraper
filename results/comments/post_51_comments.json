    "postMessage": "Hey everyone, I’m provisioning users from Entra ID to Salesforce. By default, Salesforce profiles show up in Entra ID as roles, but I also need to assign a license when the user is created. I first thought profiles and licenses were linked, but it seems they work separately. So my questions are: How can I assign a Salesforce license to a user during provisioning from Entra ID? Is it also possible to assign permission sets at the same time?",
