    "postMessage": "I’m a Salesforce developer with 10+ years of experience (including team lead and architect roles). Recently, I won the Green Card lottery and moved to the US. I’ve got all the documents sorted, speak English, and have solid hands-on experience. Knowing how widely Salesforce is used here, I thought I’d get all my papers done and will find job pretty quickly. Reality: Sent out about 700 applications (LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter). I got exactly one call back. For almost every job I adjusted my resume to highlight relevant experience (also tried using ChatGPT to analyze and improve it). Because my profiles are public, from time to time I get calls (often right after the job description lands on my gmail) asking if I’m looking for work — and then the person disappears. A few times, people reached out just to try and get my documents (ID card, bank details - scam). What am I doing wrong here? How does the Salesforce hiring process actually work in the US? Are there any insider tips or strategies? I found this thread ( https://www.reddit.com/user/ResumeSolutions/comments/1lbnqlg/how\\_your\\_resume\\_is\\_being\\_evaluated/ ), but no matter how much I network on LinkedIn or customize my resume, nothing changes. What should I do differently?",

They are not getting hired through job ads.\n\n  \nAnd, someone at your level of skill, also has the option to create their own solo Salesforce practice. That is what I have been doing for the last 5 years.\n\n  \nDon't get discouraged! Do start to connect and network and build relationships, not just submit applications.",

Put “Greencard holder, no sponsorship required” at the very top of your LinkedIn summary and resume in ALL-CAPS and bold.\n\nRacism is still very real in recruitment, despite being officially illegal. \n\nI have had more than one manager tell me not to “waste time” replying to people with foreign-sounding names because they “always” need sponsorship. And to be fair, most of them do. \n\nIt’s fucked up, but be aware that if you don’t have a name like “John Smith,” many recruiters/hiring managers will not read further than that. Not saying you should lie about your name (please don’t), but do everything you can to draw attention to the fact that you do NOT need sponsorship.\n\n2. Recommendations. Reach out to as many former managers/coworkers as you can and ask them to write you a quick recommendation on LinkedIn since you’re looking for a new role. \n\nBecause there are so many fake good-looking LinkedIn profiles for Salesforce talent, this is a great way to prove you’re “legit.” Plus it’s more impressive to have someone else write about how skilled you are rather than self-promoting. \n\nWhen I source dev candidates, I often include the word “recommendations” as a required keyword so that I don’t even see profiles who don’t have any. \n\nHope that’s helpful!",

When they respond, send them a message with your resume attached and a SHORT (1-2 sentences) pitch of your skill set and the type of role you’re looking for. \n\nYou probably won’t get a reply back because we do get so many of these, but timing is everything. I have responded to DMs like this/called them immediately when I happen to have a role that’s a good fit for the person.",
