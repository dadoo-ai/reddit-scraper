Are there recruiting companies you prefer or avoid? The job market was great the last time I was looking for n FTE position. This time, it's definitely slower and more difficult.",

At the very least, imo, it feels better to *not* see that over 100 applicants have applied to each job. \n\nPlus, in my experience, it had quite a few jobs that hadn't been posted on LinkedIn or Indeed. Of course the inverse is also true and it will sometimes not have jobs posted on the other sites. YMMV, but I found it to be useful.",
