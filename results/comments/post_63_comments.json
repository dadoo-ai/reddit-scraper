    "postTitle": "The one Data Loader security step most orgs skip (ECA + PKCE)",
    "postMessage": "Make your own External Client App (ECA) for Data Loader, point Data Loader at your Consumer Key, then block the legacy “Dataloader Partner” and “Dataloader Bulk” apps. Turn on API Access Control to allow-list only the client_ids you trust. Why this matters : OAuth tells Salesforce “which app is this?” using a client_id. Public desktop apps (like Data Loader) all share the same client_id, so a shady tool can pretend to be Data Loader. If you use your own client_id (via an External Client App) and block the generic ones, you close off that impersonation risk. Salesforce documents this hardening, but most teams don’t do it. How : Create an External Client App: Setup ▸ App Manager ▸ New External Client App → Enable OAuth. Callback: http://localhost:7171/OauthRedirect Require PKCE and do not require a client secret for web server flow Scopes: api and refresh_token (offline_access) Copy the Consumer Key (this is your new client_id). Point Data Loader to your key: Data Loader ▸ Settings ▸ Enable OAuth login from browser ▸ paste your Consumer Key into External Client App Consumer Key (Prod/Sandbox). Block the legacy apps: Setup ▸ Connected Apps OAuth Usage ▸ Block “Dataloader Partner” and “Dataloader Bulk.” Note: Data Loader v64.0.2+ supports ECAs. Go further : Enable API Access Control and allow-list only the client_ids you trust. Lock down the “Use Any API Client” permission (it bypasses allow-listing—keep it extremely restricted). This pattern (ECA + PKCE + allow-listing + blocking legacy apps) aligns with Salesforce’s latest guidance and removes a whole class of “pretend-to-be-Data-Loader” risk.",
