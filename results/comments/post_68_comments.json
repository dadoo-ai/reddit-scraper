    "postMessage": "SO I plan to take exam in 2 months or 8 weeks and now Im decide which udemy course to do. Mike wheelers course has 165k students and a 4.6 rating but its 40 hours long. Francis Pindars course has 96k students and a  4.6 rating but its 22 hours long. Don't want to do shortcuts but 40 hour course is long but still doable of course but im thinking if i do the shorter course, I may have more time to take exams and do practice trailhead. But if im missing out with mike wheelers course than maybe I shouldn't skip it. Need help deciding.",

      "commentBody": "imho  the courses are largely worthless.       they mainly teach baseline user interface and features.   not prep for the exams.\n\nit's also almost a given that even the 40hr course won't have the detail/granular info that the exam is going to test on.     the format of the cert exam is  multi-choice gotcha questions and spot feature answers.      ---where \"easy\" gimme questions will be straight up yes/no feature elements   ie... if a concept has a specific limitation  that will be a very black/white answer.    but then there will be very nebulous  scenario questions  and often the test format is.  pick 3 of 5  of these responses that are things this feature does.        none of which is really covered in any of these courses  to the degree that it truly prepares you for the exam.\n\nso... for the \"learning\" salesforce part.   do the trailheads.   for exam prep.  buy practice tests.   drill those.  memorize terminology (this helps with the black/white questions)    like... you need to know the definition/use case of the field relationships .   the security structure.  the meaning of the bullshit terms like  \"record type\"\n\nin the courses they're going to show you what a record type is,  how to access it via the setup menu/loosely configure it.       and little else.    when you get to the cert exam  it's going to be  \"which of these 5 options is not a default field on a standard record type\"\n\nimho.  do the trailheads for the functional exposure to the software     ...and study practice tests/dumps to prepare for the exam.\n\nthe salesforce exam.  and using salesforce as a software are utterly not connected.\n\nspend money on the focus on force practice exam pack.  drill that.    after you have a baseline comfort/have done the trailhead admin mix.   and or have general exp in salesforce (or sandbox configuring stuff)   ---ie spend your money actually prepping for the exam.   not paying for a slightly more indepth  trailhead.",
