      "commentBody": "Looking forward to your responses. I have two questions. 1. As a very small business, only 3 employees, I’m interested in enabling my team to do more and we have used ChatGPT to expedite research and responses. How would your digital labor offerings benefit such a small company beyond being able to scale long term? 2. I saw an example of a Saks agent that could scan clothes and offer suggestions to the customer. How many of these advertised features are proprietary or can they be created with no-language or low-language by entrepreneurs and small businesses? JG: For a small team, Slack often becomes the central hub for communication and collaboration. Agentforce integration brings intelligent automation directly into this workflow. Imagine automating initial customer inquiries directly within a Slack channel. Agentforce can field common questions, gather information, and even escalate complex issues to a human agent, all without leaving the Slack environment. Agentforce Builder is a no-code/low-code platform for building, testing, evaluating and launching agents on Salesforce core platform as well as Slack.

Can Agentforce be efficient in helping provide real time information from outside ERP/Financial systems if connected through Data Cloud, or DW? SP: One of the key advantages of Agentforce is that it is built on our deeply unified Salesforce Platform. Data Cloud is also a part of this Platform and provides a powerful layer for hyperscale data processing, a vector DB for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), as well as real-time access to structured and unstructured data. Agentforce can aboslutely support the use case described in your question.",

      "commentBody": "Hi Sanjna, thanks for doing this AMA! My title is Salesforce Architect , and over the years I’ve worked across the full ecosystem — as an Admin, Developer, Business Analyst, Integrator, Marketer Enabler, and Data Enthusiast . I’m genuinely excited about Agentforce and the possibilities it opens up, but I also find myself thinking a lot about the future of professionals like myself. Salesforce has long empowered admins and developers to build without needing to be deep engineers. But with intelligent agents automating more and more processes, where do you see the role of Salesforce professionals evolving over the next 2–5 years? Will we become agent designers, data curators, prompt engineers, or something else entirely? And what skills should we be developing now to stay relevant and valuable in this agent-driven future? Bonus curiosity: Are Agentforce agents powered by a proprietary LLM, or do they rely on existing commercial models like GPT-4, Claude, or Mistral? What’s the underlying tech stack like for Agentforce and Data Cloud? SP: This is a really exciting question! I was a Salesforce Admin long ago as a part of my first job out of college. I remember that exciting feeling of being able to build several solutions for my sales teams and integrations into our marketing tools, all without a formal degree in CS or IT. It was simple enough for me to understand, and powerful- any use case I could think of, i could make possible on the platform, whether it was an automated sales alerting system integrated into our marketing campaigns, or complex dashboards specific to our sales cycle. Building agents is different- but so much of it is the same. We have non-AI developers, our Agentblazers, who have this immense opportunity to use their business acument to build a new \"thing\": agents! it won't be entirely intuitive at first, like anything new- even workflow rules needed some getting used to ;) But once you get the hang of refining your prompts and tuning your instructions to havethe agent perform better, it will inspire a whole flywheel of innovation at your fingertips. To your addiitonal question- we use an open model ecosystem and leverage a variety of models for our AI stack.",

      "commentBody": "Hey Sanjna, I'm also in big tech product marketing, working on similar AI agents for B2B users. I've joked that it's the best and worst type of product to market, because while it's cutting edge tech and totally greenfield (exciting for marketers), the actual technology is unpredictable because it's non-deterministic, and it's got very opaque capabilities so users don't know 1) what kind of questions it can answer, and 2) when it's been updated to be smarter or help with new tasks. How are you all thinking about the marketing of these products to customers? Are you glad to have been relatively early movers because you can tell your own story, or do you find it tough because the tech is still early stage? Do you have to do a lot of educating and persuading, or do you find that users just get it? How are you messaging model upgrades and new \"skills\"? SP: This is a great question! In my opinion, the most exciting opportunity for marketers right now is to explain this new technology to customers. The unpredictability of LLMs lies in the positioning- when wielded properly, LLMs are powerful in their abilty to be dynamic and adaptive to customer questions. Of course, customers are interested in control and making sure their agents don't operate outside of the desired context. Our product has been architected with this in mind, and we have guardrails both at the Trust Layer level as well as configurable guardrails that customers can create to make sure the agnets have some repeataility, while still maintaining thier dynamic nature that maks them so impressive.",

      "commentBody": "If you rely on frontier foundation models, then what differentiates your product from anyone who builds agents with well-prompted recipes (which is more or less what you are doing)? JG: While open-source models provide a foundation, building enterprise-grade Agentic systems require significant investment in frameworks, infrastructure, and continuous optimization. For example, Reasoning engines require deep orchestration into real-time actions runtimes, RAG systems that are stand alone and not integrated with agentic reasoning often struggle with contextual accuracy and evaluation. And we learnt through many successful Agentforce implementations that a key pre-requisite for building and launching a well crafted agent running at scale in production, is tools for testing , evaluation and deoplyment. Agentforce integrated platform, with its pre-built optimizations and a build, test, deploy toolset provides a far more reliable, faster and cost-effective path to building Agentic experiences than DIY systems.

Agentforce sounds like a game-changer in AI-driven customer engagement! I'm curious about the pricing model— how does Salesforce balance affordability for businesses of varying sizes while ensuring the platform's advanced capabilities? Is it designed to scale better for smaller businesses, or is it more focused on enterprise-level adoption? Would love to hear how you see this playing out in terms of accessibility and ROI for different types of customers! SP: The pricing model for Agentforce is designed to scale with the volume of questions you get for the agent. There are a variety of factors to consider in this as well- some customers opt for different experiences for authenticated and unauthenticated users, some customers prefer to branch some parts of their customer service \"decision tree\" and have agentforce only handle certain types of questions. It is very variable across customers.",

I view marketing as a “vision board” and implement from there! Q: \nAnd for a techie: are big corporations really against their employees using AI to help with their job? For me, AI is critical as someone with autism and adhd, who has trouble wording my thoughts and tend to get lost in the details, AI has been powerful for helping me understand concepts, as a “translator”. My manager was against me using it. Q2: as someone who loves to solve problems. What are some limitations in the AI+ marketing sector you wish was easier, accessible, or implemented.

With the advent of Agentforce and other AI products, I need some advice on how best to prepare myself for the role of a salesforce developer and make myself more competitive. Thanks.",

      "commentBody": "Hi Jayesh and Sanjna, thanks for doing this. Do you see a future where professionals can use Salesforce AI to create and monetize their own domain-specific AI agents? Could Salesforce enable individuals to license their expertise at scale instead of only large enterprises benefiting from AI-driven automation? If so, when do you think this could become a reality?",
