    "postMessage": "Hi. I'm struggling with the vastness of solutions that can be built on AF.  I've read the SF stuff talking about the types of AF you can build and for different areas of the business, but it seems like you need a spritely brain to easily imagine different uses for AF. I'm an older admin (50's) and I'm worrying that I'm being left behind. Thanks. ETA:  Thanks everyone for the cool ideas! I feel pretty excited after reading the chats below.",

Prompt templates are INSANELY powerful and can be embedded within flows to automatically do more complex, advanced tasks. You can also embed headless agents within automation tools to scale and tie in Gen AI to more rigid automations (think advanced case routing, record summaries, lead assignment and filtering out spam, etc). Tons and tons of use cases (especially within existing automation) that can fit into existing processes without throwing agents everywhere just because Salesforce is pushing the product",

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done with Agentforce so far: Implemented a ‚Äúlive chat‚Äù for a specific program we run. It asks 3-4 question to determine eligibility, creates a lead and routes the lead to a human to call. Record summary. Summarises all the key information about a project so at a glance you can see the status. Case summary. Summarises key info from inbound case emails into a format that can then be used to populate fields. For example job number, address. Then we have other processes which use Mulesoft to bring back data based on job number which triggers off a flow. Image analysis. Do the photos show the damage the client claims? Case email prompt template asking for missing info, providing warranty info. Next up replacing each screen flow with Agents. Great use cases. Are you measuring ROI? Didn't know AF could do image analysis - how accurate is it? Are you involving Human in the loop to confirm the analysis? Tell me more about replacing screen flows with Agents!",
