    "postMessage": "My company has developed a custom agent action and want to be able to demo it outside of the builder. The most straightforward way that we thought to do it was through the same method in the distribute a service agent exercise provided in Trailhead. https://developer.salesforce.com/agentforce-workshop/service-agents/3-distribute-service-agent After talking with Salesforce support and our partner manager, she said the license needed (MIAW) was not available in the Partner Program Offerings to enable on our demo org. In that case, is there any advice on how to best demo Agentforce at no additional cost? We just want to show a custom agent's capabilities outside of the builder in this specific org but it seems like that's not possible.",

Is there a youtube video / article you can share on how to do that? As far as I know, I still would need the MIAW license to do that. I guess the better question is do I need that license to provision Agentforce anywhere outside the builder? I am not sure of the licences, but I could do everything in the dev org without much hassle. I can hop on a call and help you if you need, feel free do DM me",

Until your admin deletes them. They're clones of your org. Alternately sign up for a Developer Edition account with a Gmail address. Pretty sure DE orgs have MIAW and Agentforce. No expiration date as long as someone logs in every 90 days  (Not sure if this is against the terms of your partner agreement so check with someone who knows). Hmm I'll look into both - thanks for the advice!",
