    "postMessage": "Hello all, I am working on a requirement where I send an SMS to the lead when created saying welcome to XXX text messaging reply Y to consent yes and stop if you dont want to receive any more texts. The way I am doing this is using flow's send conversation action. But the problem is when the user replies Y I need to take this as a trigger point and do some operation in the backend but I am not sure what gets triggered when a user replies. Let me know if this is not clear I can elaborate",
