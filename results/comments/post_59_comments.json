    "postMessage": "Hi all, I need help with this new platform as support has not emailed me back yet and it’s been about 2 days. I am trying to schedule the Salesforce Admin exam online. Every time I try to schedule, it does not go to the next page after the repeated “Complete My Profile” Here are the steps, \nI go to Pearson Vue then log into Trailhead platform under my profile, \nGo to schedule certification and click the online option, then it asks for me to complete my already completed profile. After I do that, nothing happens, there’s not a schedule exam page, or anything. Am I missing something? I took screenshots but this community doesn’t allow photos which I understand. \nI really need to schedule and I know I’m probably missing something but my profile is complete, I’m logged in through Trailhead. Thanks!",

I would google  \"how to actually talk to someone at salesforce support\"   try that avenue.     If you work for a company that has an org.   your org probably has a general purpose salesforce sales bitch.   can always see if you can get that individual's contact name... grease the wheels on a support issue.",
