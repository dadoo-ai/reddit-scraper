    "postMessage": "Been working with SFDC for years and recently got my AI Specialist Certificate. I'm looking to dive into AgentForce this year and build some agents for clients‚Äîbut first, I'd like to experiment and build some for myself. So far, here's what I've found: Trailhead: Enable and Customize the Agentforce Default Agent Connect Your Flows to Agentforce Test and Activate an AI Agent Configure an Agentforce Service Agent Salesforce Help: Agentforce Agents Honestly, I find Trailhead a bit too basic, and Salesforce Help is often too abstract. I even tried asking the AgentForce bot, but it wasn‚Äôt much help üòÄ. I‚Äôve also checked YouTube, Udemy, etc., but apart from AI Specialist Cert prep, there‚Äôs not much out there. Anyone know of better learning resources or communities where I can go deeper?",

With seemingly\nNo guardrails to stop you from going over the allotted credits it‚Äôs very scary to think about how much we‚Äôd consume testing before we even get to a point where we would turn it loose for end users, only to basically be out of credits before we can prove an ROI",
