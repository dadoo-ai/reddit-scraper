I signed up for Agentforce World Tour NYCÂ as it is close to where I live. I would really appreciate any tips, tricks, ideas I can do to network effectively while there. Much appreciated. Thank you all!",

You will also be able to drink a good bit of the kool-aid from Salesforce. Thanks! I appreciate it. Thatâ€™s what I thought but I think Iâ€™ll go and network anyway. Canâ€™t hurt! I treat conferences like fun vacations not like work events. Easier for me I'm my own boss.",

The world tour is just a sales event for a semi finished, over priced, product. \nEspecially the agents. Useless in the real world. At least for now. Too pricey for the few tasks they can actually handle. I'm yet to see a real world use for them. I do not care about the beautifully crafted films from partners. Show me a mid sized business utilizing them. And what the price for that implementation was. Dollars and developer time. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",
