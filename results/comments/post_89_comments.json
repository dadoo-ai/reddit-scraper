      "commentBody": "Honestly, go find a first semester Java course online and do that. If you can find one in c# that’s ideal because apex is Java with some c# preferences, but most coursework doesn’t favor .net languages. Get to a point where you understand variables, conditionals, loops, and basic OOP. Go through an online sql course too. Then pick up apex. It’s custom closed stack Java that abstracts a plugin architecture (triggers, flow) and a data layer (inline soql). The lwc UI framework will require some additional groundwork in js and web technologies. You can start with a react or angular course and do just fine.",
