And the integrations were pre existing. \n\nI feel like the hardest and most critical part was the PDF generation as you can sink so much time in conditional stuffâ€¦\nI enabled my client as much as possible in Omni studio and word templates, product setup and data management but I donâ€™t see how some one inexperienced with context definitions, advanced configurations and pricing procedures didnâ€™t need a few weeks or months to ramp up. \n\nAs for the effort , you really have to gauge the product and price structure and if this needs to be integrated with a PIM system and on the opposite end what happens after order creation towards billing and an ERP integration. \n\nOn top of all that the official documentation is inaccurate at times and a lot of metadata deployment does not work (known issues) so look forward to some trial and error. \n\nNot associated but my fav blog to learn more as non-partner https://thecloudupdate.co",

Do people know what questions to ask to gather requirements, what are common pitfalls and how to properly test it? \n\nOne thing is for sure: the cost of new implementation will always be lower than full remediation later on. \n\nShameless input, here's an [article](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/goliveiradaniel_salesforce-cpq-revenuecloudadvanced-activity-7361304401820454912-ZhMh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAI5m4MBt81B0spxhn4QdkFw_63ER7vMDg8) I wrote about RCA, check out the links towards the end for some more content on this.",
