    "postMessage": "I'm curious to know if anyone in this community is actively using Salesforce's Data Cloud and Agent Force or If so, could you share your experiences, insights, or any specific use cases where Data Cloud has proven valuable for your organization? Understanding real-world applications can provide valuable perspectives for those considering or exploring the adoption of data cloud services. Anyone use it well within the state and local government scenarios and if so, how has it benefited?",

      "commentBody": "Data Cloud and Agentforce get a lot of criticism, but their impact comes down to two things: your ability to imagine valuable use cases, and having the right architect to bring them to life. We implemented a use case for a travel agency that recommends dynamic packages - flights, hotels, and activities - by pulling live inventory from multiple downstream systems. It‚Äôs used both by internal agents through an AI assistant and by customers on the website. The internal use case actually drove the most value - cutting down manual effort and drastically speeding up response times.",

      "commentBody": "I‚Äôve worked with multiple customers who have increased their self service deflection rates by 20-40%. One customer went from 40% deflection to 75%. Salesforce themselves are sitting around 80% deflection. Thing is, Salesforce is lying about their deflection lol They lie about most things Reliable claim ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I work for Salesforce lol it‚Äôs 100% true. What‚Äôs the cost-savings (if any) for that deflection increase of 20-40%? Is it more than what it would cost to hire more people to resolve cases/write knowledge articles/organize said articles? I‚Äôm sure it depends on the org but with the success that some of the customers I‚Äôve worked with, they have expanded their Agentforce footprint to more use cases beyond messaging. What have they expanded to? Were you strictly the messaging component, and someone else handles other use cases? Email to case and employee agents That‚Äôs good to know. So it is beneficial What is self service deflection? I didn‚Äôt describe that well. What I mean is providing self service via an agent deployed to a messaging channel like sms or web/mobile chat or email to case. Deflection refers to the digital agent answering the question or resolving the issue without needing the help of a human via a messaging session or a case. It allows an organization‚Äôs humans to focus on the important, hard to solve problems that require a brain/communication. Previously in chatbots that would have been a containment metric. It was fairly normal back in 2017-2018 for fortune 500 to have a 70-80% chat containment rate. I wonder what's changed. It was fairly normal back in 2017-2018 for fortune 500 to have a 70-80% chat containment rate Chatbots in 2018-2018 weren't anywhere close to what retrieval enabled chatbots can do today. You ask a legacy chatbot a question and the best it's going to do for you is retrieve a few potentially relevant articles, drop the links into a response, and tell you to find your answer yourself. The experience was no better than, and in many cases worse than, a simple Google search. You can now get a fully grounded, fully contextualized answer to a highly specific, highly complex inquiry. Today's chatbots, when enabled through AI, can fill the role of the tier one support agent, allowing human agents to focus on harder things. No doubt they're leaps and bounds better now. From a metrics perspective, I'm trying to understand the difference given legacy chatbots got the job done often enough to get rid of alot of staff in call centers. The new generative world, especially with agentforce, creates new challenges between losing intent or hallucinations. They also cost more. I was at a conference in March where AWS walked through how they use generative solutions to support their 1M job applicants a year. One of the key issues they're still trying to solve is hallucinations. They're using RAGAS and other agents to make sure the primary agent can send the right link to a knowledge article - but even then it's still making things up. I've yet to see where someone's solved issues from the new generative approaches. Was that 70-80% containment for a given topic/use case or 70-80% containment for overall engagement? I ask because I have never heard of a containment rate that high for traditional chatbots. Overall engagement. It gets boosted from the more prolific common requests (e.g. forgot password, basic questions on product, basic questions on accounts) but overall let alot of firms cut their call center staff. Each non-contained chat gave more intel into the knowledge base to increase containment on new or nuanced topics. Is displacement the same metric as containment?",

You ask a legacy chatbot a question and the best it's going to do for you is retrieve a few potentially relevant articles, drop the links into a response, and tell you to find your answer yourself. The experience was no better than, and in many cases worse than, a simple Google search. You can now get a fully grounded, fully contextualized answer to a highly specific, highly complex inquiry. Today's chatbots, when enabled through AI, can fill the role of the tier one support agent, allowing human agents to focus on harder things. No doubt they're leaps and bounds better now. From a metrics perspective, I'm trying to understand the difference given legacy chatbots got the job done often enough to get rid of alot of staff in call centers. The new generative world, especially with agentforce, creates new challenges between losing intent or hallucinations. They also cost more. I was at a conference in March where AWS walked through how they use generative solutions to support their 1M job applicants a year. One of the key issues they're still trying to solve is hallucinations. They're using RAGAS and other agents to make sure the primary agent can send the right link to a knowledge article - but even then it's still making things up. I've yet to see where someone's solved issues from the new generative approaches.",

          "commentBody": "Was that 70-80% containment for a given topic/use case or 70-80% containment for overall engagement? I ask because I have never heard of a containment rate that high for traditional chatbots. Overall engagement. It gets boosted from the more prolific common requests (e.g. forgot password, basic questions on product, basic questions on accounts) but overall let alot of firms cut their call center staff. Each non-contained chat gave more intel into the knowledge base to increase containment on new or nuanced topics. Is displacement the same metric as containment?",

      "commentBody": "I will approach this from purely technical side.\nSalesforce say you need data cloud to have agentforce in prod. Reality is you can get away without enabling data cloud in sandbox to play to an extent.\nIf your agent will work with crm data natively (think flows to retrieve records to summarize them), then only reason why you need data cloud is for saleforce to save advanced logs to.\nIf you plan to use RAG, data cloud is where vector database will live (be it files or knowledge).\nIf you want agent to browse through a lot of data in one dataset (say product descriptions of thousands of products), you would also look at data cloud to store those records from crm (via data stream) and then use RAG (likely with custom retriever) to present relevant results.",

      "commentBody": "As an Salesforce Partner, we've done a number of Data Cloud implementations. Its great for when you have customer data strung around multiple different data systems - think Healthcare with multiple patient records systems, billing, scheduling, etc. - tie them all together into a unified profile and then push that unified profile out through different marketing channels.  Retail is also good for it when you have legacy POS and e-comm on separate systems that don't really talk to each other and/or a third party order fulfilment.  Same sort of use case - data all over the place, hard to join it together - Data Cloud is a good solve for that. Agentforce can technically run without Data Cloud if all of your stuff is in CRM.  Its when you have to it get data from other systems that can make it slow - you can do API callouts to fetch, but if all that data is already unified in Data Cloud, just makes the Agent's job a bit easier. What about for SLED accounts? It sounds like it would be beneficial for many of those too, correct? Data Cloud just became FedRamp compliant like a couple of weeks ago, so sure SLED use cases abound for that too and are probably going to open up even more now because of getting FedRamp status.",
