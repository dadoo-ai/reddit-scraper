Looking for ideas from the community and want to think about some options. Iâ€™m used to developing with code so my knee jerk is to just create an LWC/Apex that can do this, but there might be a better way.",

      "commentBody": "At my job we help teams build AI workflows for exactly this type of integration and honestly, your instinct about LWC/Apex isn't wrong but there are definitely cleaner approaches.\n\nThe native Salesforce approach means building custom Apex classes to handle the S3 API calls, which works but puts all the logic inside Salesforce. Our clients who go this route usually run into issues with file size limits and timeout problems on large uploads.\n\nBetter option is using a middleware platform to handle the heavy lifting. You can set up flows in Salesforce that trigger external services via REST callouts when files are attached or updated. The external service handles the S3 upload/download and just returns metadata back to Salesforce.\n\nFor retrieval, you've got a couple paths. Some customers store the S3 object key in a custom field on the record, then use that to pull files back when needed. Others build a simple file management component that lists available files from S3 and lets users download directly.\n\nThe tricky part is authentication. You don't want AWS credentials sitting in Salesforce code. Most enterprise setups use IAM roles with temporary credentials or a secure token exchange service that Salesforce can call.\n\nIf you're comfortable with code anyway, I'd actually recommend building it as a separate microservice that Salesforce calls via REST. Keeps the file handling logic separate, easier to scale, and you can reuse the same service for other systems that need S3 integration.\n\nSkip the complex ETL tools for this use case. A simple API service with proper error handling will be way more reliable than trying to cobble together some Zapier style connector that breaks every time Salesforce updates their API.",
