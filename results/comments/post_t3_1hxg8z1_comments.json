    "postTitle": "I Just Sat Through An Agentforce Pitch",
    "postMessage": "I just joined a client in a conversation with their Salesforce AE to demo and pitch Agentforce. Here is what happened: The 'Demo' They showed a 2.5 minute demo for a real company that they said we were not allowed to record. In it, they showed a person asking to cancel an appointment. The agent asked for an email, showed two appointments on the books, and asked which to cancel, then it did. Then it showed a booking process where it built a quote based on some things the client said and offered a bunch of days and times. The 'Pitch' & ROI They offered the tool at $2.40 per conversation. My client said \"that's scammy\". The AE said  \"In Salesforce's research, a client conversation costs on average $15 per agent that is not using AI\" My client asked \"How much would setup cost?\" The AE said \"Funny enough Salesforce made all of us AEs build an agent to see how easy it is! It only took me an hour to build my first agent.\" The Value The AE, realizing the client was not very interested, communicated the following talking points to communicate value: - It is easy to build flows for each use case - It provides 24/7 coverage - It maintains the same tone of voice and quality of service - It controls costs when scaling and limits head count The Leading Edge My client ultimately said \"I am not making any AI decisions in the next year, I am waiting to see who proves themselves in the market for these solutions. I do not want to be on the leading edge.\" The Final Push The AE, not wanting to give up so easy, offered a 15% discount per conversation for a January decision on a commitment of a minimum spend of $5k in order to lock in price and prevent future cost increases. It did not sway them. My Take - This tool is not ready for the spotlight. - The demo video they showed us they insisted we can't screenshot or record, showing they are not confident. Wouldn't you want to scream from the rooftops if this thing was awesome? - The company they demoed, I went on their website, and they are not in fact using Agentforce. - Still no real clarity on Data Cloud being needed or not. It was glossed over by the AE What's Your Take?",

      "commentBody": "I sat through building an agent at an event a few months ago. The biggest thing for me was that while it took \"30m\" to setup and execute in their \"Turtle Bay\" customer service example, all of the apex, flows, and automation happening in the background was already done for you. I would imagine the same thing is happening here. Sure it took them an hour to build; that is exclusive of all of the actual development and process automation that is needed to actually feed and build the agent. This is honestly what bothered me the most. Dont try to sell me a product that is not what you are showing. Explain in timeframes or dollars the cost to build something viable for a customer so that i know what i am getting myself into. Yes, YMMV, but telling a client \"it only takes 1 hour to set up\" is an insane bait and switch. Yeah I saw bunch of those presentation too ...all they did is like connect the dots ...dots which were already built ..but never told us time it took to build those dots.... That is classic salesforce. It isn’t new In fairness though, two things you’re not thinking of…1) agents are going to ship with OOTB topics and actions so spinning an agent new IS really fast but customizing using new topics and actions is where time will be consumed 2) it is truly designed to work with existing flows with minimal alterations at best. How many implementations won’t have existing flows? Unless you’re starting from scratch with a new service org it’s gonna be rare you’re not gonna have flows, and customer starting from scratch on service cloud are highly unlikely to be deploying agents because they are no where near the AI maturity yet without heavy lift which should be communicated by the sales team AND the partner Yeah .... I laughed thankfully I was on mute. Reality is, there are very few people on the planet that even know how it actually works confidently. And those people are not SF AE's, I can tell you that. Yes, despite their 1h trailhead badge. unfortunately [removed]",

IMO it adds friction and reduces autonomy by introducing an AI agent as a middle man. It was such a SHIT example lol. The moment a person asks to cancel it should escalate. There was no concept either of 'how about you reschedule?' What a waste! That would be great to ask if they want to reschedule. If the only way a company can keep appointments is by making cancelling them hard, it's not a good business. The best way to introduce friction is take a deposit for appointments and if the appointment is cancelled within 24 hours of the start time it's not refunded. My doctor does this and it's fine. People call and leave VMs or email to cancel appointments all the time because they don't want to use a calendar invite, but that's not considered a middle man. So the AI bot experience is a good use of AI in my books. Especially if it's built to ask for a reschedule.",

      "commentBody": "Funny.  $2 per conversation was the price given when it was announced, amusing that it now takes a “discount” to almost get that price. I’m aware of companies that have built comparable solutions on other platforms (AWS) and estimate the cost to be $0.10 - $0.20 per conversation. Salesforce might be able to get away with the pricing for companies that have put all their eggs into the Salesforce basket.  For companies where Salesforce is but one piece in a portfolio of applications, they’re going to choose AI solutions that are 10-20x cheaper and are extensible and reusable across the portfolio. That 0.10 - 0.20 likely do not account for the costs of maintaining integrations.  Not saying it makes up the difference to Agentforce costs but its a big part of using external AI with SF.  I also find you spend a lot of time waiting for a team to build comparable features that you get for agentforce out of the box and in the future will get new features in agentforce vs having to think of and then build them yourself with your own integrated AI. I also think that the winner in this market will be a AI focused player - not Salesforce throwing all it's eggs into this basket at the cost of improving it's core. I'm fairly sure that $2 per interaction is about what you'd pay a BPO to offshore your chat. That's what agent force is competing with IMO. Not $15 per interaction on-shore US support. That said, anybody with the IT resources to build their own on AWS is getting a hell of a lot more than a 15% discount.",

      "commentBody": "I work for an SI with active work as well and have a few thoughts. Pricing is murky and was based on the assumption of replacement of US-based resource interactions (contact center agent call handling, as an example).  The economics for clients who have offshored contact center or BDR/SDR activities is an obvious challenge, but they've indicated interest in offering flexibility for this.  In terms of SI support for commercial discussions, the party line right now is \"work with your AE for pricing\", which leaves a lot of questions and challenges.  For orgs like mine where we do strategy work and implementation work, how do we have good/accurate cost/benefit conversations with our clients without good guidance on pricing for specific use cases?  What is the incentive for SF to work with an SI vs. SF ProServe?  Lots of open questions there The tool itself works really well, and sets up fast IF you have implementors who understand prompt engineering and have a strong base with gen AI.  If you can craft direct prompt instructions and can minimize iteration when making your agents, that is the path to value.  However, trial and error is challenging here because prod and sandbox interactions all incur LLM transaction costs to your account.  It will be CRITICAL for clients (and SIs) to ramp up their knowledge on how to do good prompting prior to jumping into implementing Agentforce to control both implementation costs and OpEx. The concept solves for the core problems that were part of Einstein copilot (and others here have mentioned some of this).  Copilot/Agentforce is only as good as the data that's in CRM for RAG - tying it to data cloud as a data aggregator solves for this.  The Data Cloud credits component of all this is going to be another major economic concern as it's a lever that has a couple layers of abstraction from the process of interacting with an Agent. Others in this thread have already discussed this well, but there is a significant reliance on existing automation to drive automation of the automation.  For clients and implementors, this makes the importance of good BA work even more crucial.  You NEED NEED NEED to understand the business processes at a fundamental level, understand where you can configure a short 3 step flow to build a puzzle piece, and build an atlas of these interactions to be effective in designing Agents that have enough agency to be useful. I'm excited by the tech, but it's far from a turnkey solution. Great analysis thank you so much friend! And wow no test mode free of consuming conversation credits?? That is thievery. That's related to how the tech works - any time the agent needs to \"call and response\" it will incur a traffic cost to the LLM holder (whether that be OpenAI, Anthropic, or others), regardless of whether it's in Prod or Dev/Test.  SF pays the cost for both of those because both of those generate \"real\" results from the GenAI platform, so the cost is passed along to the end user. Whoa... sandbox testing incurs LLM costs too... how the heck are we supposed to evaluate it? Oh, I guess that's part of the 1000 \"free\" conversations.",

      "commentBody": "I am probably not their target customer yet (~100 license non-profit, but we do have a lot of SF add-ons besides the standard licenses) but it's also getting pushed a lot by our consulting partners.  I started the agentforce trailheads, and while it seemed cool, there's definitely more of a learning curve than 'make a few flows' because you have to do a lot of set up in a certain way to get the full end to end experience (interacting with the customer, pulling the correct data, and taking the correct action)...which is to be expected, but I think Salesforce is underselling it a bit. And that doesn't include doing tests to make sure not only the 'sunny day' use cases work (i.e. what they show in the demos), but also negative use cases (can I imitate someone and get access to information I shouldn't or make changes I shouldn't). The cost is another thing. While larger call centers can better track how much time agents are spending on calls, cost per call, etc, smaller orgs may not have that info to show the ROI and having a fixed cost (i.e. employee cost + tools) is easier to digest than \"Well, it's x amount per interaction, which I don't fully understand, and there's no cap to the number of interactions\" especially if IT (and Salesforce) is viewed as a cost center. And the data cloud. Per Salesforce, you don't need data cloud (though it sounds like they add on a $0 data cloud SKU for the product), but it's unclear how much the product features suffer from lack of data cloud. I defnitely see use cases both internally and externally. Internally it can help 'automate' items for our users that are too prickly to fully automate, or where there still needs to be human interaction. And externally, it could be great externally for folks looking for emergency or long term assistance that may otherwise not want to talk to a human for whatever reason or just find information that's on our website but not easy to access. Yeah frankly I need to see a client use it for a year and then I will actually understand the full cost of ownership. I am confident if you put me in front of a live Agent I would be able to make it share and divulge info it should not. help.salesforce.com is using an agent, give it a try It has a limiter where anything kinda fishy was met with 'I can help you with xyz' Right - and that’s how other agents are built. The language isn’t anything special or unique to the agent on the help.salesforce.com site.",

      "commentBody": "Sounds like they swept setup costs under the rug pretty fast. Sure you could technically build an agent in an hour but I have a hard time believing it does anything meaningful or wast tested very thoroughly Setup is highly variable.  There really isn't much set up with agentforce itself.  The trick is having actions and data to give the agents so they can do stuff otherwise they are fancy chat bots.  This means you need good flows/apex that can be used by the agent. Lots of companies are going to find out they are ill prepared for AI; not because of shortcomings of AI but becuase of shortcomings within how they manage their systems and the lack of investment they've put into them.  Basically you needed to have already been automating things with older automation approaches to really step into AI effectively. Your second paragraph is basically the quote of AI - if you don't have a good data management ecosystem and invest in that, it's going to be crap in crap out. I wouldn't say crap in/crap out.  You just have to take more time with AI to sort it out.  AI is actually very good with unstructured data as long as you can pump it in.  Of course pumping in unstrucutred data into Salesforce can be a costly exercise. Fair, yes with sufficient training data AI can \"de-crap\" a messy database, but if you're not structured to be able to flow data in and circulate it through your ecosystem, it becomes an exercise in cost overruns, as you said, for little benefit. Agreed. Poor data hygiene is going to buy us time against A.I. I would consider all of what you said as set up for an Agent. I'm not going to tell a client that I built their agent but sorry it won't work because you don't have the processes in place to provide it data. Yeah, I mean, I am their implementation partner. The AE and I have worked together on the account for over a year. The AE did not ask me to participate, did not sync with me about it, did not mention me when implementation came up - because they know none of us are ready to build and it would be a burden to push it to be sold this month. The client wanted me there. I also work for an implementation partner as well.  We have 11 active Agentforce projects ongoing right now and we're seeing value.  There are definitely a few bugs we've come across but of all the products Salesforce has released that were not ready for prime time, I actually think this is a game changer. Of those 11 what is the most common use case? Service chat bot answering questions with knowledge/faq and case deflection. Chat bots with NLP have been able to understand the customer's question and provide an answer based on searching the KB and case history for a few years now. I feel like that's a not a new use case. Maybe this version can handle more complex customer questions? It has been able to do it for years but you needed to define the intents and utterances and build the dialog flow (in the literal sense, not the Google product). The reality was that very few customers actually did this as it was very painful and typically frustrated end users. If you couldn't predict precisely what they were going to say, and then map that to what it really meant, you had a bad experience. So even this basic use case is something of a step forward. In terms of \"agentic\" - actually being able to execute a transaction on behalf of the customer ... It depends on constrained search, just matching the intent to the description field of a flow etc. That last part is wildly basic and not all that useful in the real world IMO. I just cannot stomach the pricing model. Sure, $2.40 for agent might beat $15 for a human interaction, but it’s much, much more expensive than the $.05 - $.10 you’d pay to make the API calls to OpenAI to do the same thing. No doubt!  I think they will fix their pricing model at some point.  Most of the projects I'm working on are related to a Salesforce investment where they are providing licensing at no cost to gain momentum in the marketplace. lol you buried the lead on that one lol fuck sake Yeah but you can’t ground open ai reply’s in your CRM and or structured/unstructurd data Why not? lol WTF are you talking about. Crazy, 11, good for you guys! I'd ask that AE, \"great, so if we buy this, you, Mr. AE, should be ok to commit to build the agent for us in an hour?\"",

          "commentBody": "Your second paragraph is basically the quote of AI - if you don't have a good data management ecosystem and invest in that, it's going to be crap in crap out. I wouldn't say crap in/crap out.  You just have to take more time with AI to sort it out.  AI is actually very good with unstructured data as long as you can pump it in.  Of course pumping in unstrucutred data into Salesforce can be a costly exercise. Fair, yes with sufficient training data AI can \"de-crap\" a messy database, but if you're not structured to be able to flow data in and circulate it through your ecosystem, it becomes an exercise in cost overruns, as you said, for little benefit.",

          "commentBody": "Yeah, I mean, I am their implementation partner. The AE and I have worked together on the account for over a year. The AE did not ask me to participate, did not sync with me about it, did not mention me when implementation came up - because they know none of us are ready to build and it would be a burden to push it to be sold this month. The client wanted me there. I also work for an implementation partner as well.  We have 11 active Agentforce projects ongoing right now and we're seeing value.  There are definitely a few bugs we've come across but of all the products Salesforce has released that were not ready for prime time, I actually think this is a game changer. Of those 11 what is the most common use case? Service chat bot answering questions with knowledge/faq and case deflection. Chat bots with NLP have been able to understand the customer's question and provide an answer based on searching the KB and case history for a few years now. I feel like that's a not a new use case. Maybe this version can handle more complex customer questions? It has been able to do it for years but you needed to define the intents and utterances and build the dialog flow (in the literal sense, not the Google product). The reality was that very few customers actually did this as it was very painful and typically frustrated end users. If you couldn't predict precisely what they were going to say, and then map that to what it really meant, you had a bad experience. So even this basic use case is something of a step forward. In terms of \"agentic\" - actually being able to execute a transaction on behalf of the customer ... It depends on constrained search, just matching the intent to the description field of a flow etc. That last part is wildly basic and not all that useful in the real world IMO. I just cannot stomach the pricing model. Sure, $2.40 for agent might beat $15 for a human interaction, but it’s much, much more expensive than the $.05 - $.10 you’d pay to make the API calls to OpenAI to do the same thing. No doubt!  I think they will fix their pricing model at some point.  Most of the projects I'm working on are related to a Salesforce investment where they are providing licensing at no cost to gain momentum in the marketplace. lol you buried the lead on that one lol fuck sake Yeah but you can’t ground open ai reply’s in your CRM and or structured/unstructurd data Why not? lol WTF are you talking about. Crazy, 11, good for you guys!",

      "commentBody": "Agentforce is ready, but the implementation effort can be HEAVY. For a simple customer facing agent, you can set up an agent that books appointments, opens basic cases, and uses knowledge pretty quickly. But effort skyrockets quickly once you layer in custom actions. I am not doubting you can do that. I am doubting the safety of exposing your database via a bot in public. I think it is ripe for exploitation. Define database. You can be pretty selective during configuration. It's NOT just a plug and play tool that automatically scours your CRM data. I will have to learn more. I hope it is a well designed tool. I am encouraged by your confidence! So how much of your data do you randomly expose via sharing rules, permission sets and profiles? The agent uses the same rules, it defined as a user with a profile and permissions. The only additional source it can access is the knowledge libraries... Which you control the contents of. Correct do more reading and less making shit up based on  foundation models in the wild ... This is great insight, thanks Ok-Choice! I like the sound of that. Still see some elements of risk for an open-to-the-world agent, but I tend to be a bit paranoid. But isn’t the point that the bot needs access, like a sysadmin, in order to, for example, find an Account? If you restrict the bot’s access, it also can’t use the information. (Please correct me if I’m wrong.) An in-house user who randomly sees an account they shouldn’t typically isn’t a big deal. However, a bot with access to all accounts that is connected to a chat interface outside of Salesforce is a much bigger issue. If someone can trick it into giving out information, the potential for misuse is far greater. It needs access to accounts yes... Just like the 24 hour old brand new call centre person... No different. Does it need access to every field, no, just what it needs to do it's job... Just like that semi trained minimum wage call centre person. May skyrocket.  If you have good practices with how you build actions in your environment a lot of them can be primed for use by an agent pretty quickly.  For example if you were already automating things many of those automations plug well into AI.  If you've never built something to work without a human involved then you are right; effort skyrockets to basically rebuild it to be automated because that is what the agent will need. For sure. I just think there's a disconnect between reality and what Salesforce pitches. \"You can do anything!\" and \"I built this agent in 30 min!\" can both be true but still be misleading.",

As a consumer I don't want to talk to your robot. I want a human conversation please. Preach! They are selling this all wrong and it infuriates me enough to want to become an AE and make $300K doing it right. You're not exactly getting it right yourself, considering customer facing chatbots are the single area where AI is actually proving its value. Of course AI should be public facing in chat bot functionality. The current chatbot feature set allows a customer to ask a question and at best, get two or three articles handed back to them so they can do the work themselves and find their own answer. AI absolutely solves that problem and it can even offer customers a white glove experience while doing it. It's always the takes with the most conviction that are the most wrong headed. You're wrong, that's all I can say.",

You're not exactly getting it right yourself, considering customer facing chatbots are the single area where AI is actually proving its value. Of course AI should be public facing in chat bot functionality. The current chatbot feature set allows a customer to ask a question and at best, get two or three articles handed back to them so they can do the work themselves and find their own answer. AI absolutely solves that problem and it can even offer customers a white glove experience while doing it. It's always the takes with the most conviction that are the most wrong headed. You're wrong, that's all I can say.",

      "commentBody": "Was this the first software pitch you ever attended? Quite frankly, it's always been like that. Nothing of what you describe is particular to Agentforce. I've always and still follow the approach of consultative selling, so I don't tell my customers that they can implement Agentforce in whatever short timeframe. But since I'm doing this for more than 10 years now, I'm also very cognizant that I'm basically only making life harder for myself. Most decision makers don't want to hear this stuff. These are people who buy based on some nice slides, and then years later, with tens of millions burned, nothing to show that works. Similarly, nothing changed in regard to the Salesforce value proposition. It's still a customer platform, Agentforce is a mostly customer facing conversational channel that offers a ton of things as a standard and doesn't need to be integrated with your Sales/Service/Marketing world, because it's an integral part of it. It's seriously great, in the very same way that Flow is great. Yes, it still has its issues, because the whole technology set has them. If you think Agentforce is a scam, then GenAI is a scam - which is totally sensible opinion that I would agree with in a heartbeat, depending on the details of your argument. What I mean by that, is that humans are a scam, too. Agents don't need to be infallible, they just need to be better than the average human. When we debriefed as a team after, we all joked that it felt like the AE was a hostage and behind the camera was a person with a gun pushing the AE to sell. Your observation is correct, we are being held at gun point to sell agentforce I'm sorry, I know it's a high stress job and you're in the busiest time of the year. I hope you make it through! I closed my year at 230%. But zero agentforce Kick-Ass! Nice job “Heres a one hour training, now go wedge this into every possible customer crevice you can” OP, a lot of the frustrations you’ve shared aren’t unique to the buying side. From my pov, the product is the first one in a while that I believe can actually be “industry disrupting”; but it’s a huge learning curve where reality doesn’t necessarily match company expectations. Point taken. Yeah, there are AEs like that. They could also be new and inexperienced, or actually close to being fired, or a number of other things. It's a shame when meetings go like that. Yeah this AE is not new. Maybe struggling though with financial targets. Fiscal year ends in a couple weeks. A few things could be true:  AE probably won't have your account next year so doesn't care about losing credibility. AE is mikes away from quota so thinks they won't have a job come Feb 1 so doesn't care about loss of credibility. Their RM & leadership could be mandating the pitch in a last ditch attempt to make ACV for the year. Agentforce is a mostly customer facing conversational channel that offers a ton of things as a standard and doesn't need to be integrated with your Sales/Service/Marketing world, because it's an integral part of it. It's seriously great, in the very same way that Flow is great. The problem is not the technology—Agentforce is not terrible from a technical perspective. The issue lies in the pricing. Nobody would use Flow if it cost 2 per execution, just as almost nobody will pay 2 per conversation for Agentforce. (I reckon it only starts to make sense somewhere in the 20 to 50 cents range.) I have yet to see a single convincing use case where you’d achieve a positive ROI compared to a human at 2 per conversation.",

      "commentBody": "I've been implementing Agentforce since September. Its definitely not ready, its early beta from my experience. Its very slow at responding to queries takes like 15 seconds, and each subsequent instruction slows it even more.\nI've personally caught more than 10 breaking bugs and not all of them have been fixed. There is no proper documentation or cooking books. I would stay way for the next year or two, its too early , they arent ready",

      "commentBody": "I've been playing a lot with the Agentforce capabilities since it was rolled out. They are ready for the primetime, but I think their pricing is still out of whack. It's very very good. Create a video, educate us!! How does it work start to finish without the shortcuts that all of the Trailheads and hands-ons push. I don't have the time or the YouTube ability to do so, but let me be more specific on the things I've been doing: 1) \"Agentic\" design Focusing on the client-facing interactive ability of Agentforce. I built a Service Cloud Agent to handle cases for Experience Cloud portals. It's really good. I just followed the Trailhead instructions to build an initial one, and iterated on that. 2) Copilot (Prompt Builder) use-cases This is what blew my mind. You can create a prompt and pass JSON information from Salesforce to the LLM and have it do stuff with it. I currently have Prompt Builder doing Company Descriptions, Account Summaries, Industry Information, and other \"busywork\" that users don't want to do. It's really good. AMA lol For real clients or just for learning? Real clients. But salesforce says you can build one in an hour? Thought you said it was very very good? Without giving away any of the functionality that I've built for my clients specifically, I built - today - four Prompt Builder usecases that are wildly good in under an hour. It's actually as good as the hype. A lot of those 'short cuts' come with the out of the box agent..... They are part of the package you get, each of the different agent types has a different core of prompts and flows. Would be interesting to hear what you’ve done with Agentforce. We are the first company in the UK to purchase the Sales SDR agent for Agentforce- seems pretty solid",

      "commentBody": "The $2.40/conversation thing was a big point of confusion. Apparently a “conversation” is the first touch point and can extend for the next 24 hours, so that $2.40 is actually $2.40/day/person interacting with a bot. Building bots is pretty simple and intuitive, and a basic bot doesn’t take long at all to build. This effort can go up exponentially if you want to build your own data model or have the bot have a lot of flexibility with what actions it can perform. Data Cloud is not strictly necessary as far as I can tell, but it is needed for auditing responses and seeing where the data and grounding is coming from. To this end, I would not recommend AgentForce without Data Cloud for any business that cares about data security. I may be paranoid, but if my competitor was using Agentforce and I wanted to inconvenience them, I would pay someone to start hundreds of conversations per day. I think having a public facing Agentforce agent would be VERY risky no matter what. Couldnt they do that today with human reps and waste all of their time as well? No? You pay a human to sit there per hour no matter what. Saying \"Hello\" to an agent and disappearing and doing it again would be easy to spot. If there is no man in the middle, and you are billed every time a new convo starts, you are definitely not in control. Human reps may be cheaper and could discern legitimate customers from spam Human reps are not cheaper. I said may but .5 USD a ticket would be a great salary in many places on the planet.",

      "commentBody": "Basic Agentforce functionality is not difficult to set up, assuming you know what you are doing and a number of prerequisites are met. And those are quite specific and related to the data available to feed the agent. So far Agentforce solutions being offered are very specific and oriented towards concrete use cases with no customization. Which is a good thing to some extent, though greatly limits the scope of application. But this is a \"crawl\" phase now before \"walk\" before \"run\".  This thing is here to stay. Of course it's not yet worth the ridiculous hype around it, but this is how marketing and sales work :) Level headed take, thanks! I've got my AI Specialist Cert, and trying to do some demo builds for myself first, I'm curious about what docs folks are using to build agents?",

      "commentBody": "> The agent asked for an email, showed two appointments on the books, and asked which to cancel, then it did. Did the agent at least send a magic link to the email address to validate identity? I don't think AEs understand the 1FA implications of their demos, and just how much of a security red flag that is. Every Architect level prospect will simply just smile and walk away from these demos with 1FA. wow very very good point. nothing just 'what's your email' and boom I'd say that AE failed to impress upon the audience, \"this is just a demo, obviously we'd never collect customer information in this fashion and use it to do lookups - they'd need to authenticate via an existing mechanism on the site/app.\"",

      "commentBody": "Any idea on cost overrun protection? We currently have our bots and CS agents open to the world, if someone wanted to mess with us and open 10 million chats (we normally only have a few million a year). Would it block that or are there any distributed attack protection mechanisms in place? It won’t be too complex to have a large bot network put some serious load and cost on the company. Frankly I believe this is a gigantic risk even though some have disagreed with me. Our sites are a major target (generally top 10 or top 20 in their countries) so I’m pretty concerned for stuff like that. We had one provider where we did a payment pilot keep the pilot up as a security test as it drew more scammers than several major banks and insurrance companies they had as customers combined. I think it's the internet, there if always chaos. Better for experience cloud and internal. I asked this question specifically at one of the onsite agentforce trainings - how to prevent malicious actors. The recommendation was that the AI Agent should not be publically / easily accessible. Salesforce recommending putting an einstein bot before the Agent was accessible. Which seemed bonkers. Sounds like, ‘we decided to not make it our problem’. Should be some level of bad actor management if you get above standard levels of usage (flag with real agents to green light the usage or stop the agent)",

      "commentBody": "Unfortunately what you actually saw was a lazy/not equipped account team and specifically an SE that didn’t take the time to customize the out of the box Agentforce Service Agent demo to their customer.  Worse yet they didn’t vocalize properly that this was a base level demo component that barely glosses over the capabilities representative of what ASA should be able to ship with agentforce 2.0 with ready to go topics, actions, and flows ready to go and capable of reusing your previously built flows to create new custom actions for your agent with almost always minimal adjustment. Set-up time is truly less than 30 minutes for these OOTB use cases but just like anything customization to your business is going to take time to build the topics and actions and tie them to the flows you want for your business. Now here is where I show value on these every day. Step 1: show the spin up of a net new ASA. It truly is \nSuper fast step 2: Highlight topics and talk through what they are and how they are created. I even like to change mine on the fly to add an easily recognizable instruction so when I show the topic being called we understand that the instruction modification worked. Example: “when a customer asks to cancel an appointment always tell them ‘Please don’t do that’ “ Step 3: show actions and how they tie to prompts or flow or apex code or whatever else. Then either build an action or augment an existing action. Step 4: show how it works /live demo highlight the topics and action we built and then diving into the power of the generative ai couple with data cloud, Rag, and atlas What you don’t see behind the scenes and something they skipped completely is tying the agent to external data using data cloud  to leverage RAG capabilities  and the atlas reasoning engine.  This is where the magic starts happening. I’ve shown demos to customers with just a couple of uploaded marketing brochures and asked Agentforce to compare the two products, tell me what I’m missing if I choose one over the other, and suggest which product would be the best given a certain criteria. Trust me this is impressive and is what convinced me that Agentforce was real vs the previous copilot capabilities we pitched all of last year. Ive shown demos with extensive knowledge libraries and seamlessly switched between topics ranging from generic to deep dive technical product troubleshooting and watched RAG and Atlas crush it. I can go deeper and deeper but I’ll spare you for now. Lastly, Set up time is not a question the account team clearly was prepared to answer and to be honestly it’s slightly a loaded  question. I can set up an agent in 15 minute, add data cloud and rag 1 day because of search index building (assuming DC is already implemented), add customizing a few flows 2 days, add customizing every action and  flow you can ever think of…well that’s not what an SE does because they are not there when partners do that and time is always dependent on the complexity of the customizations. Sorry you had a bad experience but in the end just know from a skeptic the product is legit from what I’ve built and shown and unfortunately your sales team did a poor job of proving it. There was no discovery. There was no solution engineer. It was a video demo. The AE sent an email templated, the client said I don't want to take a look, the AE pushed and pleaded to be allowed to show, we jumped on the call, they showed a video and tried to sell it without even asking 'do you already use a chat bot on your site?'. Call lasted 20 minutes. It was embarrassing. Ha even better. The AEs were given a tool that lets them spin up teaser agents that are minimally functional and meant to be videos they record to send to customers to get a discovery. There is no way this agent should it be a full pitch unless you’re a master at spinning the capabilities which very few AEs are at this point. Not having an SE on the call was a mistake and not building custom to the client is an even bigger mistake. But this time of year people get urgent and do things that don’t make sense in hopes of creating a quick January deal for the books. That’s said don’t let this be a reflection on Agentforce or the ease to build and connect to existing flows and clouds and do really impressive stuff. This is only an indictment on a few things including timing in the year and pressures that brings for AE, poorly planned gtm strategy and push from sales leadership for all AEs to sell agents despite many barely knowing what an agent actually does and how it works, and lastly resources available to the AE (demo components and SEs). Your AE has a reason they had to reshow the agent they built for the other customer(laziness, couldn’t get an SE, couldn’t build another agent, time, etc) but they don’t have a reason for being bad at pitching what they are showing properly. Personally I laughed when they showed the app the AEs are using to build these teaser agents because it’s great for someone that doesn’t know what they’re looking at but anyone that does know can  see right through the experience you’re trying to sell. Thank you Salesforce SE! Let us know your @salesforce email so we can setup time with you. Or can we go to Salesforce.com and do it there?",

          "commentBody": "Ha even better. The AEs were given a tool that lets them spin up teaser agents that are minimally functional and meant to be videos they record to send to customers to get a discovery. There is no way this agent should it be a full pitch unless you’re a master at spinning the capabilities which very few AEs are at this point. Not having an SE on the call was a mistake and not building custom to the client is an even bigger mistake. But this time of year people get urgent and do things that don’t make sense in hopes of creating a quick January deal for the books. That’s said don’t let this be a reflection on Agentforce or the ease to build and connect to existing flows and clouds and do really impressive stuff. This is only an indictment on a few things including timing in the year and pressures that brings for AE, poorly planned gtm strategy and push from sales leadership for all AEs to sell agents despite many barely knowing what an agent actually does and how it works, and lastly resources available to the AE (demo components and SEs). Your AE has a reason they had to reshow the agent they built for the other customer(laziness, couldn’t get an SE, couldn’t build another agent, time, etc) but they don’t have a reason for being bad at pitching what they are showing properly. Personally I laughed when they showed the app the AEs are using to build these teaser agents because it’s great for someone that doesn’t know what they’re looking at but anyone that does know can  see right through the experience you’re trying to sell.",

      "commentBody": "Smart Client and Smart Consultant. The first step before considering any AI implementation is to ensure your data is clean. If you have a lot of dirty data and push it into a data cloud, all you’ll end up with is a more expensive system full of bad data. When you add Einstein, it’s supposed to help you understand your data. However, if your data is dirty, it won’t understand anything accurately. Then, when you add an agent to the mix, that agent will also work with the same dirty data. Essentially, you’re spending money on tools that learn from and operate on flawed data. Why not prevent dirty data in the first place by implementing a single, unified system? In my work, we offer a revenue lifecycle solution designed to prevent bad data from ever being created. All data resides within a single platform, built on a single data model, with a single silo process. This setup allows all revenue teams to access and interact with flawless data seamlessly throughout the revenue lifecycle, based on their specific touchpoints with customers In my view, you shouldn’t engage with a large language model (LLM) or other AI tools until your CRM data is flawless. If not, your agent will charge you based on bad data interactions, which will ultimately cost you more in the long run. Taking your hard earned cashflow based on a hope or a dreams. Make your data flawless, then you can decide if you still need AI. That’s my two cents.",

      "commentBody": "I also question the legitimacy of the pricing. The pricing model is touted as per conversation but the billing is actually based on credits and credit use is calculated on things like number of characters. It’s not until you start to track your credit usage you realise that the “characters” includes all the instructions and responses to/from the AI/LLM.  And suddenly your $2.40 (or whatever they’ve told you) is covering 1 question maybe 2 at best. Not a multi step conversation.  Because each new step all the information/instructions previously provided to/by the AI/LLM gets resent and you pay for those characters again. And Salesforce won’t tell you until you start querying discrepancies but what they report your usage is within your org isn’t actually accurate, it’s a known bug. You have to setup your own monitoring in Data Cloud to get accurate numbers. Well the fishiest part was \"2.40 per convo, but we can give 15% discount if you commit to 5k\" What the hell is that lol... how is that pay per use?",

For example, automatically including information from an external loyalty system in to a prompt template in prompt builder for generating customer communications by referencing a data cloud object in the template directly. It shouldn’t be the AE’s job to solve product-market fit.",

Now your Temu AE selling it at overcharge $2.4 that will not even get thru quoting and in the Order Form. Do you client a favor and escalate it. There tons of examples internally and externally that goes beyond this simple usecase. I am not recommending Agentforce. For their only logical usecase the better source of data is their website explaining their services. A web-hosted chat bot for qualification (they are a pest control business) that will ensure the person wanting to book actually has a problem their team can address. A sick pigeon by a train stop? Nope A racoon in an attic? Yup",

Others have already commented on this but there's definitely a gun to everyone's head to sell Agentforce, hoping they take feedback like this into deep consideration I am interested, the post got 105k views which was not something I planned for lol. For all you AEs and SEs I wrote this follow-up post: https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/1i1zxaf/if_i_had_to_sell_agentforce_here_is_how_i_would/ All the positive posts on here are Salesforce AEs and SEs trying to defend a product that’s too early. I love how no one is posting a real YouTube of actually setting up a client and seeing a real agent live and working. Agentforce is consumption based billing, it may be easy to sign contracts? The final bill, depens on how the product performs.",
