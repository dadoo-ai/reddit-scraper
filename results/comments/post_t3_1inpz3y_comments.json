    "postMessage": "EDIT: SOLVED The user needs to have license Einstein Agent to be able to assign the required Agentforce permission set license. First time I've tried to set up Agentforce outside demo org and I'm stuck at begging. I'm not able to assign the Agentforce Service Agent User permission set license to any user. When I follow the instructions on help site , at step 4. I always get this error: Admin User can't be assigned the Agentforce Service Agent User permission set license, because Admin User's user license doesn't support it. I'm also missing the Access Agentforce Default Agent permission set group, I'm trying to add either individual Permission Set License Agentforce Service Agent User or AgentforceServiceAgentUserPsg which I have available. The user has a Salesforce license and a Sys Admin profile. I also tried with other users/profiles with the same result. What have I missed?",

      "commentBody": "The ASAU perm set is intended for a customer facing service account, you wouldn't want to assign it admin permissions even if you could. There's another perm set to manage agents, I'm not at a computer atm but it starts with \"Agentforce\". I don't see the ps you mention in the help article Same error if I tried Permission Set Group. In the reference, it also says: If you prefer using permission sets to manage user permissions, assign the Access Agentforce Default Agent and Prompt Template User permission sets. Agentforce Service Agent User isn't a thing you assign to an admin user. I'm confused what your issue is, maybe you need to edit your initial post because Agentforce Service Agent User is what you mentioned there I see what you mean, sorry for the confusion. Updated the post. Tried for other users/profiles as well I see your post has \"solved\" but I think you're still confused lol. Or I am! Agentforce Service Agent User is not meant to be used for any internal user profile, system admins included. It's intended for a service account that acts as the agent for customer-facing interactions. Agentforce Service Agent User isn't mentioned in the help article you linked to at all. What is mentioned is Access Agentforce Default Agent, which is intended for your internal users. They're not the same. I'm glad you got your issue fixed but just be mindful of the permissions granted to the agent, you don't want to leak information I know what you mean, i confused here few topics. I'm definitely aware of being restrictive regarding of permissions",
