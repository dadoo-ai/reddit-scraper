I don't have the definition of what that is to her just yet, but I did say I'd do some research on options. Months ago, someone else asked me to build a report for this, and then I also didn't get any parameters, but I was able to get started on a field that would show an indicator. We're meeting this afternoon to go over things, and she's already interested in Snowflake. What are other nonprofits using for this? A favorite App Exchange package? Formulas? Screaming into the void??",

If you take donations, you could tie a campaign to your website donation form. Or if you do mailings, you could tie a campaign to the letters you send out and see which ones result in a donation. Or if you have events you could have each one represented by a campaign and measure invites vs. attended.\n\nI'm not sure where Snowflake comes into the equation here. A data lake isn't necessary unless you are looking to store and evaluate terabytes worth of data.",

I also don't know what Snowflake has to do with anything we do...we have less than 5k contacts to evaluate at present, I just don't think we have the need for something like that.",

      "commentBody": "I'm coming at this from a Marketing Operations perspective.\n\nFirst off, they're likely looking for raw numbers like numbers of website visitors and numbers of people who filled out website forms and whatever. That data should be available from Google Analytics, so loop in a digital marketing manager for assistance.\n\nNext, data out of Salesforce and marketing tools.\n\nI'd start with raw numbers out of Salesforce first.\n\nNumbers of raw Leads/Contacts/Accounts (or Households). Break down the Account/household data into location like state, country, unknown. Who has donated/not donated. Do a chart of list growth over time (how many did you have 5 years ago, etc.).\n\nHow many of those unique people have email addresses at all (field for email is not blank). Then how many have unique email addresses (use the unique count in Salesforce reports).\n\nHow many of those are mailable email addresses (how many have unsubscribed or bounced). Use the field for email opt out to determine this number. Unsubscribe number may need to be done from the email tool.\n\nThen dive into the email data. Do you have a marketing automation platform? Pardot or Marketo or similar? You'll go over there this data.\n\nHow many total person records do you have in the email tool? Compare that to the raw numbers in Salesforce. (Pardot, for example, requires an email address to exist in order to be in the email tool. So the raw numbers of people from Salesforce will likely be higher than the raw numbers in Pardot, because some percentage will have no email address).\n\nThen run some reporting based on how many emails your company has sent in the current calendar (or fiscal) year, the prior year, and going back 5 years.\n\nShow the email list growth for the same time \n\nGet raw numbers of email sends, delivery (this is send minus bounce), email opens, unique email link clicks, unique click to open ratio, number of unsubscribe, percent of unsubscribe, etc. \n\nIf you are not entirely sure what they want, start with this set of email engagement stats, and they are likely to tell you more specifically when you get them this much.\n\nGoing back over to Salesforce, I would pull data from Salesforce Campaigns.\n\nWhat number of campaigns were created in Salesforce in the last 5 years, broken down by year.\n\nWhat kind of Salesforce Campaigns were created each year. You likely have a field for Campaign Type, so start with that. It's usually things like Email, Event, Website, Advertising, etc. You'll also likely find that a number of these are blank. Definitely present that data of 'unknown' type. But if you can tell by the name of the campaign that it's a webinar or a website form, or whatever, do feel free to update that so you get more accurate data.\n\nSo then once you have the number of Salesforce Campaigns created per year and the types, you'll want to show if they have leads and contacts associated with the campaigns, and how many Responded to the Campaign. \n\nFor the number of people associated, this will be raw numbers of Campaign Members. And for the Responded, this will be a separate field. If you for some reason can't get this at the Campaign report level, you'll need to run a Campaign with Campaign Members report (but I think it is available as raw numbers).\n\nNow, at this point, none of this will allow you to de-duplicate the campaign members. Meaning: if a lead was part of three Salesforce Campaigns, they're going to get counted once in each campaign. And this is very normal! Many people will attend an in person event and also do something like fill out a website form.\n\nIn order to do the de-duplication part, where you can actually get to the *percent of engagement* that your stakeholders want, this is where you have to go over to a more powerful reporting tool. \n\nAnd this is where my \"easy\" suggestions end. \n\nBecause I have built it manually in Excel, but every online tool does things a bit differently. Tableau will be different than PowerBI will be different than the tool formerly known as Bizable, etc. And likely this will come from a person like me, a Marketing Operations person.\n\nBut this is a great start (the raw numbers) to show you want to be helpful, but need more guidance on specific things the stakeholders want.",
