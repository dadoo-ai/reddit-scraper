    "postMessage": "So we want to build is use case where user will upload a file and agent has to extract text and create a new record in specified object??\nBut Agentforce is pretty bad with files,i even tried writing an apex action where it takes the file send it to third party OCR ,but agent can't even pass that??\nIs there any solution for this??\nOne more way I thought is creating a lwc for file upload and extracting text then Directly sending data with instructions to copilot,but can we achieve that??\nPlease can anyone help??!!.",

You should use Data Cloud RAG to process the files and include semantic search. This is the way. I may or may not build Agents everyday to show customers. Data cloud rag combined with Atlas is what provides the capabilities and wow factor. Agentforce is just the UI providing the conversational experience at that point. Do you have any guidebooks or resources on how you do it?",
