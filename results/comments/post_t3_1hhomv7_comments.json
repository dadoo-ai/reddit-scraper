Just gotta be careful about data exposure, and all of the boring stuff like prompt injection etc etc. Let’s say, I can’t do Apex because my endpoint channel is just a website.

You’re effectively asking similar to “how do I build a Tesla from the ground up because I don’t want to buy the one that’s already built?” I don’t really think you understand everything that agentforce is supposed to do beyond just hit an LLM, which then means you don’t actually understand the scope of what you’re asking and you’re not providing any other comments besides “well I want literally everything Agentforce does without using Agentforce” As someone pointed out, a huge value add of Agentforce isn’t just gen AI. It’s also configuring your agent to take actions on behalf of a prompt, while tying in the Atlas Reasoning engine to handle the “understanding” for the agent.

      "commentBody": "Curiosity question. If you’re going do everything that agentforce does, what’s the point of building custom? You have to write all the code to hook up to an LLM, any data sources, Salesforce objects, etc, maintain and tweak, update if any LLMs update APIs, data security, prompt injection as the other commenter mentioned, a chat interface to expose to the public (if you’re doing external), the list goes on and on Agentforce has all of this prebaked in, and one of the selling points is quite literally NOT doing what you’re asking how to do Are you just doing this for learning / hypotheticals? Or do you have experience with an Agent already and are not seeing great results in your use cases? what’s the point of building custom? $2,- per conversation is why This. The custom solutions can easily run circles around AgentForce from a quality standpoint. And for the $2 you could accomplish 50 other tasks as well. Sure, but looking solely at the convo price feels pretty short sighted when you start comparing $2/convo to the cost of custom dev and maintenance costs for building your own, on top of any sort of LLM api costs, handling all the data security and privacy, etc. SF is giving a ton of free credits away right now, and (my assumption) is it’s going to cost much more to custom build an entire agent, hook it up to all your different data sources, Salesforce apis, maintenance etc. I’d be super curious to see ROI comparisons once it gets a bit more “out there” for an agent compared to full custom build Some of that comes down to what tools you have in your tech stack. I built a RAG model with an endpoint in databricks for about $100 monthly in compute. The difficult part was integrating it to Einstein, so for a POC I built a visualforce front end to exchange messages back and forth. $2 per interaction will get costly very quickly for a larger enterprise without the right guardrails. Forget about the free credits at the moment because it’s been made known that they are using this freemium model to hook people in - get them to the point where they are depending on these models so they can jack up the prices. I will spend as much dev time needed to circumvent that and built as much custom as I can. It’s more of a crusade against their new “fuck you, pay me” model they are building. How many Salesforce products are you paying list price for? Do you anticipate actually paying $2 per conversation? I don’t pay list price for anything, sure. I’m on the Einstein1 tier and full agentforce isn’t even included in that. It’s greed on their end. Cuz Salesforce gets hit by usage costs from the LLMs. Ahhhhh you are exactly who I’m looking for. Someone who is hellbent and would rather sell his kidney than to pay ~1 dollar per conversation. Buy an engine and build a vehicle vs buy a car type of guy. Ok real conversation here, so to have RAG I need to pay 100 dollars in Databricks and this hundred dollars around how many interactions can it accommodate? Does this RAG cuts across my 3 data points, CRM Data, Transaction Data and policy pdfs. Or it’s gonna be 100 dollars per data point? Let’s say I’m a fairly large enterprise 600 agents probably gets 3M cases/inquiry for my 2M customer base. How about LLM to generate my Fancy Hello There greetings? All great questions. So the $100 in compute was based on 2400 pdfs that I indexed and vectorized. There was some trial and error baked into that number so I’m going to check it again in a few weeks of just hitting the endpoint vs all the chunking. That number is largely dependent on which model is used as the chat model, how many DBUs are being processed, etc. Because I’m that extra, I’m also working on a separate model using the openAI api so I can A/B test output and cost vs my databricks model. Smart. What did you use to index and vectorize? I’m about to do the same with my own instance. I did it all in databricks as that’s what we use as our data lake. It has some great out of the box tools for that, but they also have a cookbook that I borrowed some python, made some tweaks, and had a proof of concept stood up end to end within a matter of days. https://ai-cookbook.io I need to find something like this but just on Google and Gemini. Nice. Yes - building a custom agent will be more time consuming and costly than setting up an Agentforce agent. The einstein trust layer is mostly marketing imo. Data security / privacy / No retention policy comes pretty much out of the box for most LLMs. But after setting a custom one up you're paying cents per conversation instead of $2. I'd genuinely be curious to hear about usecases that could return a positive ROI with this kind of pricing. Because i'm really struggling to see even a single one. Do you pay list price for all of your other Salesforce products? The guy probably pay full price for products on Sale at Costco 🥲 Ahhh indulge me on this. Hypothetically building everything yourself how much does it cost to keep the lights running? I think it's more that you're not paying a flat fee per conversation as for agentforce. There will be tasks/chat that will be resource intensive and consume tons of tokens, and perhaps will cost you even more than 2,-. But whenever somebody writes your bot to ask where their package is, it will cost you a few cents instead of $2,- This is purely hypothetical. Sometimes I wonder what if they want the outcome but don’t want to pay 2 dollars hahaha Got it! Was just curious if you had actually implemented yet and had frustrations since it’s so new To be fair, there are plenty of full featured agent frameworks that handle these things. The most time consuming thing might be building the UI because LWC are so unproductive.  It would be trivial for an experience gen AI software developer to build something that targets specific use cases and is likely more capable than the generic solution Salesforce builds.  Still, I don't disagree the ROI isn't there unless your company has a well developed internal AI program (in which case one would be asking reddit for help)",

It has some great out of the box tools for that, but they also have a cookbook that I borrowed some python, made some tweaks, and had a proof of concept stood up end to end within a matter of days. https://ai-cookbook.io I need to find something like this but just on Google and Gemini. Nice. Yes - building a custom agent will be more time consuming and costly than setting up an Agentforce agent. The einstein trust layer is mostly marketing imo. Data security / privacy / No retention policy comes pretty much out of the box for most LLMs. But after setting a custom one up you're paying cents per conversation instead of $2. I'd genuinely be curious to hear about usecases that could return a positive ROI with this kind of pricing. Because i'm really struggling to see even a single one. Do you pay list price for all of your other Salesforce products? The guy probably pay full price for products on Sale at Costco 🥲 Ahhh indulge me on this. Hypothetically building everything yourself how much does it cost to keep the lights running? I think it's more that you're not paying a flat fee per conversation as for agentforce. There will be tasks/chat that will be resource intensive and consume tons of tokens, and perhaps will cost you even more than 2,-. But whenever somebody writes your bot to ask where their package is, it will cost you a few cents instead of $2,-",

          "commentBody": "Sure, but looking solely at the convo price feels pretty short sighted when you start comparing $2/convo to the cost of custom dev and maintenance costs for building your own, on top of any sort of LLM api costs, handling all the data security and privacy, etc. SF is giving a ton of free credits away right now, and (my assumption) is it’s going to cost much more to custom build an entire agent, hook it up to all your different data sources, Salesforce apis, maintenance etc. I’d be super curious to see ROI comparisons once it gets a bit more “out there” for an agent compared to full custom build Some of that comes down to what tools you have in your tech stack. I built a RAG model with an endpoint in databricks for about $100 monthly in compute. The difficult part was integrating it to Einstein, so for a POC I built a visualforce front end to exchange messages back and forth. $2 per interaction will get costly very quickly for a larger enterprise without the right guardrails. Forget about the free credits at the moment because it’s been made known that they are using this freemium model to hook people in - get them to the point where they are depending on these models so they can jack up the prices. I will spend as much dev time needed to circumvent that and built as much custom as I can. It’s more of a crusade against their new “fuck you, pay me” model they are building. How many Salesforce products are you paying list price for? Do you anticipate actually paying $2 per conversation? I don’t pay list price for anything, sure. I’m on the Einstein1 tier and full agentforce isn’t even included in that. It’s greed on their end. Cuz Salesforce gets hit by usage costs from the LLMs. Ahhhhh you are exactly who I’m looking for. Someone who is hellbent and would rather sell his kidney than to pay ~1 dollar per conversation. Buy an engine and build a vehicle vs buy a car type of guy. Ok real conversation here, so to have RAG I need to pay 100 dollars in Databricks and this hundred dollars around how many interactions can it accommodate? Does this RAG cuts across my 3 data points, CRM Data, Transaction Data and policy pdfs. Or it’s gonna be 100 dollars per data point? Let’s say I’m a fairly large enterprise 600 agents probably gets 3M cases/inquiry for my 2M customer base. How about LLM to generate my Fancy Hello There greetings? All great questions. So the $100 in compute was based on 2400 pdfs that I indexed and vectorized. There was some trial and error baked into that number so I’m going to check it again in a few weeks of just hitting the endpoint vs all the chunking. That number is largely dependent on which model is used as the chat model, how many DBUs are being processed, etc. Because I’m that extra, I’m also working on a separate model using the openAI api so I can A/B test output and cost vs my databricks model.

The most time consuming thing might be building the UI because LWC are so unproductive.  It would be trivial for an experience gen AI software developer to build something that targets specific use cases and is likely more capable than the generic solution Salesforce builds.  Still, I don't disagree the ROI isn't there unless your company has a well developed internal AI program (in which case one would be asking reddit for help)",

      "commentBody": "Putting all your knowledge articles in a Vector DB for RAG retrieval is definitely *not* how to build a scalable chatbot. The AgentForce community has somehow propagated this myth (plus 1FA security) as a best practice. It makes for good demos and prototypes, but it's not an enterprise-scale solution. There are good references online from OpenAI explaining how ChatGPT converts unstructured PDFs and files to semi-structured data behind the scenes and uses plain-old text indexes for standard search. https://blog.langchain.dev/applying-openai-rag/ The secret is using an LLM during the text chunking and again for query expansion (QE) at runtime. > I'll use different Salesforce APIs like query Contact, Account or Object I need Correct. QE is the preferred method in 2024-25.",
